		<desc>Sonic the Hedgehog CD (ã‚½ãƒ‹ãƒƒã‚¯ãƒ»ã‚¶ãƒ»ãƒ˜ãƒƒã‚¸ãƒ›ãƒƒã‚°CD Sonikku za Hejjihoggu ShÄ« DÄ«?), or Sonic CD (ã‚½ãƒ‹ãƒƒã‚¯CD Sonikku ShÄ« DÄ«?), is a platform video game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega originally for the Sega/Mega-CD in 1993. It is the first game in the Sonic series to make use of the CD-ROM format, featuring high quality audio and full motion video. Development began in Japan around the same time as Sonic the Hedgehog 2 in the United States. Originally, the games had many similarities, but over time became vastly different projects.[3]

The story of Sonic CD follows Sonic the Hedgehog as he utilizes time travel to save Amy Rose and Little Planet from Doctor Eggman and Metal Sonic. The game features the debut appearances of Amy Rose and Metal Sonic, both of whom have gone on to become recurring characters in the Sonic series. Time travel is a key aspect to both the story and gameplay, with nearly every stage containing four different variations (one for each time period) featuring alternate stage layouts, music, and graphics.

Sonic CD received critical acclaim, being considered both one of the best platform and Sega/Mega-CD games of all-time.[4][5][6] It was ported to Microsoft Windows 9x as part of the Sega PC brand in 1996, and to both the PlayStation 2 and GameCube as part of the Sonic Gems Collection in 2005. An enhanced port of the game was also released for Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, iOS, Android, Windows, Windows Phone, and Ouya.</desc>

The title is a Kinect motion-sensing based title for the Xbox 360 and was released via the Xbox Live Arcade service in North America on February 1, 2012.

To this, the open-ended game is a collection of eighteen different modes that allow multiple players to interact in unique ways through the Kinect cameras and motion-sensing in an augmented reality shown on the console's display, such as playing in a giant virtual ball pit or walking through simulated lava.</desc>

		<path>./Ion Assault.m3u</path>
		<name>Ion Assault</name>
		<desc>Ion Assault is a twinstick shooter with a space ship, set in enclosed arenas in space similar to Geometry Wars. The left stick is used for movement and the right one for aiming, shown through a red laser. The goal is to survive waves of enemies and space debris (mainly rocks, splitting up into smaller elements similar to Asteroids), but there is a twist to it. Rather than shooting directly, the ship can activate a mass reactor, slightly slowing down movement, but it enables the ship to gather a large mass of ions floating in the arena and concentrate it around the ship. These can then be fired in the desired direction and the amount determines the damage. These ions ricochet off walls and can therefore target multiple enemies, or be caught, before they spread out in the playfield again. There are no other basic means of attack, so the "bullets" are all around the field to be gathered and recycled again.

There are four main levels that consist of five stages each, along with a boss fight. Destroyed ships leave behind score orbs that can be collected. Certain ships carry power-ups, divided in an active and passive category. Gravity power-ups for instance extend the range of the mass reactor, while a shield temporarily guards the ship against enemy attacks. The campaign can be played in a cooperative mode and there is also versus multiplayer. Gameplay is entirely different in the latter, as the player needs to call on friendly ships to target the opponents, and vice versa.</desc>

Alien Breed 2: Assault is the second chapter in the Alien Breed series, and is an explosive science-fiction arcade-shooter with an epic story, swarms of highly intelligent alien enemies, high-impact weaponry, highly detailed and rich environments, developed using Epic Games' Unreal Engine 3. Take control of the hero, Conrad, the shipâ€™s Chief Engineer, and continue your fight for survival across the fatally damaged space vessel, against a ruthless assault by an alien horde. Your only hope relies on reigniting the alien space craftâ€™s monstrous engines to rescue you from impending annihilation. Deep inside the bowels of the unfamiliar craft, and with time rapidly running out, ready your weapons and begin to claw your way through the darkness in a fight for survival. But you are not alone. The ship is home to the carnivorous alien horde and something else... something yet to reveal its true intentions... something biding its time. In addition to the thrilling single-player campaign and all new â€œsurvivorâ€ modes, the game also offers relentless, action-packed, two-player online co-operative battle modes.</desc>

The more you eat, the bigger you get, and the bigger you get, the closer you come to taking on the fearsome Shark King. Starfish bubbles don't help you grow, but theyâ€™re an easy way to boost your score. Oysters offer up bonus points in the form of pearls, but be quick or the shell could snap shut with you inside! Nibbling on the tail of a patrolling barracuda is a risky way to earn extra pointsâ€”he can turn on you in an instant. And the jellyfish - well, it's best to swim clear of them altogether. Did you know that tuna can swim up to 50 miles per hour? Or that a parrot fish can change its gender? Feeding Frenzy includes more than four dozen fascinating fish facts like these - one between each game level.</desc>

		<desc>**DX12 SUPPORTED VIDEO CARD REQUIRED - LONG BOOT IS NORMAL!**. After 13 years of it appearing briefly on Microsofts PartnerNet service, Goldeneye 007 XBLA on the Xbox 360 has leaked. The name is Bond. James Bond. The famous hero of Ian Fleming's novels returns in this first-person shooter, which is based on the movie of the same name. Agent 007 and his friend Alec Trevalyan (a.k.a. Agent 006) were sent to Soviet Union on a secret mission. But everything goes wrong, James Bond barely escapes, and his friend is presumed dead.  Ten years later, a mysterious organization named "Janus" appeared. Commanding a new satellite called "GoldenEye", the organizations attempts to steal money electronically from banks, deleting all evidence of transfer. It's up to our Agent 007 to venture to Soviet Union once again, and to put an end to Janus' ambitions.  In this 3D action game, you control James Bond from a first-person perspective, using a variety of weapons (from knuckles to grenade launcher) to eliminate your foes. However, many parts require you to be careful, to stay unnoticed or to snipe guards from distance, since they will react to your presence and alarm their comrades. The game is divided into missions, and in some of them you'll have to perform other tasks besides killing your enemies: disarm bombs, take pictures of important evidence, or avoid killing scientists. The game features a multiplayer mode with a variety of options, and three difficulty levels.</desc>

		<name>Bliss Island</name>
		<desc>Bliss Island is an action-puzzler where you play a character called Hoshi (a Zwooph), who using blasts of air from his trunk, can juggle or manipulate other objects or himself. The game consists of a collection of mini-games, which can either be played individually (with the aim being to get a high score) or through the adventure mode (where you play each one in order, only progressing to the next one once you've achieved a goal/high enough score).

The mini-games consist of tasks such as:

- Smashing invader-style blocks as they march down the screen, by moving Hoshi into them. This is done by blasting pulses of air from Hoshi, which then makes him move.

- Blowing fruit balls into other objects (such as flower bumpers) so that they ricochet around the screen and into a monster's mouth, similar to Pachinko machines in arcades.

- A trick shot billiards game, where you fire Hoshi into the balls on the table, trying to pot them all within a certain number of air pulses.

- Bee Racing, where using similar controls to Hoshi, you race against AI Bees around a track (whilst avoiding obstacles such as rocks and snails)

... and various other mini-games that follow the theme of ricocheting balls off-targets / into holes either within a time limit or to achieve a goal (such as to clear bugs off a flower, to hit another ball off the same color, to pick up stars, etc.).</desc>

It is developed by Criterion Games and published by Electronic Arts for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, iOS and Android via PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, iTunes App Store and Google Play Store.[1]

In Burnout Crash!, players drive into an intersection and attempt to cause as big a pile-up as possible. Unlike previous games in the series, Burnout Crash! is played from a bird's-eye or aerial view. Points are earned for causing damage and destroying the environment and other vehicles. Leaderboards powered by EA's Autolog service enable players to compare scores with other players.[2]

The game features three game modes and six different intersections to play, as well as seven drivable vehicles, for example the Vegas Saloon. The Xbox 360 version of the game also includes a Kinect mode, allowing players to use gestures to control the game.[3]

		<desc>Comic Jumper: The Adventures of Captain Smiley (also known as simply Comic Jumper) is an action video game developed by Twisted Pixel Games published by Microsoft Game Studios. It was released for the Xbox 360 via the Xbox Live Arcade Marketplace on October 6, 2010 as part of Microsoft's Game Feast promotion. It was first announced on September 4, 2009 at PAX with a debut trailer. It is the third original game created by Twisted Pixel following The Maw and 'Splosion Man, all three of which are exclusive to Xbox Live Arcade.

In Comic Jumper players control Captain Smiley, a comic book hero whose comics are poorly received. Seeking help from Twisted Pixel themselves he "jumps" in other comics, hoping to glean from each genre's popularity. As he enters each comic genre his design and weaponry changes to suit the comic style. The game received above average reviews from critics, with gaming aggregators GameRankings and Metacritic averaging 74.72% and 73/100, respectively. In its first month Comic Jumper sold over 40,000 copies and as of year-end 2011 has sold over 103,000 copies. Critics praised the game's humor, saying the game had several laugh out loud moments and excellent comedic delivery. The difficulty of the game was compared to games from the 16-bit console era.</desc>

After an Allied victory in Red Alert 2, the Soviet leaders travelled back in time and removed Albert Einstein in 1927, preventing the Allies from creating atomic weapons while the Soviet Union rose to power, battling the Allies in the 1950s. In this game, the Empire of the Rising Sun rises to power as a threat as well (an unintentional result of the Soviets' time travelling). All three factions are playable, with the main gameplay involving constructing a base, gathering resources, and training armies composed of land, sea, and airborne units to defeat other players. Each faction has a fully co-operative campaign, playable with an artificial intelligence or with another human player online. These campaigns follow a storyline, with specific mission objectives and unit restrictions applied.</desc>

Set on hilly terrain, similar to artillery games likeScorched Earth, the gameplay is real time instead of turn-based. It supports two to seven players, represented by differently-colored tanks, with a range of weapons. The terrain on which this occurs, an ever-decreasing yellow landscape, is completely obliterated by the players during gameplay or otherwise gradually whittles down to a flat plain.

The original Death Tank was a bonus game in the Sega Saturn version of PowerSlave (1996). A sequel/update, Death Tank Zwei, was hidden in the Saturn version of Duke Nukem 3D (1997).</desc>

		<desc>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves). Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.</desc>

		<name>Goat Simulator</name>
		<desc>Goat Simulator is a third-person perspective action video game developed and published by Coffee Stain Studios. It was released for Microsoft Windows via Steam on 1 April 2014, and ports for Mac OS X and Linux were released on 27 June 2014. Mobile versions for iOS and Android were released on 17 September 2014. Versions for the Xbox 360 and Xbox One were released on 17 April 2015, and for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 on 11 August 2015; these ports were developed by Double Eleven.

The game has been compared by the developer as akin to skateboarding games, but where the player controls a goat aimed at doing as much damage as possible around an open-world map, without any other larger goals. The game, initially developed as a joke prototype from an internal game jam and shown in an early alpha state in YouTube videos, was met with excitement and attention, prompting the studio to build out the game into a releasable state while still retaining various non-breaking bugs and glitches to maintain the game's entertainment value.

The game received mixed reviews; some reviewers praised the title for providing a humorous sandbox interface to experiment with, while others criticized the game's reliance on social media to popularize what was otherwise a simple and buggy product.</desc>

		<name>Jewel Quest</name>
		<desc>In the past, an archaeologist was on a treasure hunt for the fabled Tonatiuh, The Temple of the Fifth Sun. To reach the location, he had to conquer portals by realigning relics according to an ancient description. He wrote his progress into his Jewel Quest journal.

Today, while arranging manuscripts for the university, he stumbled across his old journal and now he wants to try it again. The player takes the persona of the unnamed archaeologist writing more notes into his journal as he goes.

Each level represents one dot on the treasure map, leading from the airplane take down point to the location of the temple. There are five advancement categories for progression beginning with Explorer and ending in Researcher. All levels within all categories must be completed to reach the treasure. However, if a level is too difficult, the opportunity to skip it presents itself at a cost of one life (out of five). It is possible to attain up to ten total lives during the game.

The objective in a level is to do exactly what the ancient script states, "Align the relics you can see, across or down in groups of three. Turn all squares to solid gold, the path to riches will soon unfold.".

So, for example, at the start of level 1-1 (first level in the first group), a 7x7 grid appears, each block filled with one of four different items (relics). Exchange adjacent items so that a line of three or up to five items will be created (more than five is possible, but this can't be done manually). Those items will vanish and the ground will change from beige to gold, the spaces will fill with the items from above, and new items fall in from the top of the playfield. Once all blocks are gold, the level is completed. When the time runs out, one life is lost.

While the level progresses, there are bigger playfields or more complex ones. Complex means that they are not always in square or rectangle form, but, for example, they can also have a zigzag side, where either horizontal or vertical alignments aren't possible. More relics are added in the playfield, and also the time becomes shorter.</desc>

		<desc>Sonic the Hedgehog (ã‚½ãƒ‹ãƒƒã‚¯ãƒ»ã‚¶ãƒ»ãƒ˜ãƒƒã‚¸ãƒ›ãƒƒã‚° Sonikku za Hejjihoggu?) is a 2006 platform video game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game primarily allows the player to use Sonic, Shadow and Silver across several stages. Other secondary characters also become playable across the game. The plot follows Sonic's quest to protect Princess Elise after she is kidnapped by his rival Dr. Robotnik (Eggman) and is aided by new and returning allies.

The game shares its name with two earlier Sonic games, a manga, a television series, a comic book series, and their eponymous main character. To disambiguate, the game has been referred to as Sonic 2006.[3] It was produced in commemoration of the 15th anniversary of the Sonic the Hedgehog series. The game faced multiple issues during development, which resulted in rushing the product despite existing bugs. Both versions were heavily criticized for long loading times, poor camera system, gameplay glitches, complicated plot and sloppy character control.</desc>

Our intergalactic anchor girl must also must take part in 'Rhythm Battles', where she takes control of a musical instrument and plays in time with her opponent and 'Lyrics Battle', where Ulala gives her singing voice a workout in order to defeat the foes that await her.

A TV channel is only as good as it's last ratings and the same is true of Space Channel 5. Ulala must keep the viewer rating high, failure to do so will lead to the show being cancelled and the plug being pulled on Space Channel 5 - Space Michael is counting on you!</desc>

It's basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up featuring the characters from The Simpsons TV show. The player can choose to play as each of the four Simpson characters. Homer, who punches and kicks; Marge, who swings her vacuum cleaner; Bart, who wields his skateboard; and Lisa, who uses a jump rope as a whip. Other weapons such as hammers and bowling balls are also available to use. The game's levels are Downtown Springfield, Krustyland, Springfield Discount Cemetery, Moe's Tavern, Springfield Gorge, Dreamland, the Channel 6 studio, and the Power Plant. Each level ends with a boss whose speed and strength will increase after taking a certain amount of damage. End level bosses are the wrestler Professor Werner von Brawn, a hot air balloon shaped like Krusty the Clown, a pair of bouncers, a drunk at Moe's Tavern, a henchman in a bear suit, an imaginary, gigantic bowling ball, and a martial arts sensei dressed like a kabuki actor. There's also the showdown finale against Smithers and Mr. Burns in a robotic outfit.Between levels, the player can compete against the other characters in two mini-games to be first to complete a task (inflating a ballon and waking up their character).</desc>

		<desc>Uno Rush evolves the typical rules of Uno into a fast paced card game where the old tactics of the game are thrown out the window. Each player can now see the others cards as each round begins. You then have a set time limit to play your hand, based on either the number or colour of the card on the play field. You can re-order the cards in your hand while you wait for your turn to arrive, and if you plan it quick enough, you can play all your cards in one move (matching a colour or number in order) while calling 'Uno!', all in the space of a few seconds. The aim of the game is, as always, be the last person to have no cards remaining.</desc>

Game modes: Race and take out your enemies in either single player or player vs. player game mode. Wild tracks: Drive on eight different tracks of progressive difficulty. FREE download: Yaris is a free Xbox Live Arcade game. Play it today. Gallery feature: Browse through the game's cast of characters, including all the Yaris cars.

Ball your way up to the top of the league with unthinkable slams and outrageous plays to get the crowd pumped for momentum on your side! Momentum mania!
