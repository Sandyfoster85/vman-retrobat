		<name>Baldies</name>
		<desc>The premise of Baldies is similar to many real-time strategy games. You start with a limited number of Baldies with which you construct buildings, increase your population, and create the necessary instruments of war. There are four classes of Baldies--builders, scientists, soldiers, and workers/breeders. Structures include small, medium, large, and huge houses as well as science labs and barracks. Each building has specific properties that assist in your destruction of the enemy.</desc>

		<desc>Iron Soldier 2 is a first-person 3D giant mech game. Players must pilot their building-sized robots in a variety of missions ranging from search-and-destroy to surgical attacks to defending objectives.

Each weapon can be mounted on a certain part of the robot's body, but once mounted, no other weapons can be placed there. So, while there is a wide range of weapon configurations, not every weapon can be combined with others. Players can destroy buildings in levels to find crates containing new weapons and extra ammunition for current weapons.</desc>
