		<desc>You are police officer Bob, whose aim is to apprehend a certain quota of criminals (litterbugs, speeders and the like) each day. This is done by chasing them and sounding your siren at them - in some cases they will need ramming off the road.  There are also hardened criminals to catch - if you can get one of these to confess, your day's work is considered done.

The game's action is presented with an overhead view of your squad car. Car upgrades are available, to be brought from your reward money. You earn Demerits by crashing, wrongly arresting innocents, or failing to meet your quota. Too many demerits and it is game over.</desc>

		<desc>Year 2019, Manhattan. After a nuclear war.  

Out of the ashes comes a hero, Jonathan Rogers, better known as "Jungle Rogers", the owner of the asphalt jungle. The only chance of survival is to reach the airdrop platform XV-238, located in the control base of the schizophrenic assassin professor McJerin, and to escape to outer colonies.

There is no easy way to do this. The game is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up, with thugs coming at you constantly, and a few moves to use on them. You must cross the dangerous streets of Manhattan, which have become over-run by feral thieves. Later he awaits for the guardians of the scientific complex of McJerin.</desc>

		<desc>Afterburner is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name. The goal is simple: use your F-14 Tomcat and shoot as many enemies as you can. This aircraft has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons (basically machine guns). In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all the time.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.</desc>

		<desc>Air Bucks is a business simulation game which tries to capture the ins and outs of the airline industry without bogging the player down with details. It starts in 1946 and the goal is to build up a successful airline with a small starting budget. There are many details in the game, e.g. the player can buy rights to airports, arrange seats on the planes to carry more or less first class passengers, decide on the quality of in-flight food or entertainment, and more. 

The game features "special events" similar to Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon, which require quick changes in the plane operations to accommodate them. Other important industry-specific activities include designing global routes and paying for landing rights, tinkering with plane layouts and determining fares for each leg. All those decisions are made inside various menu screens. Competition consists of up to three human or AI controlled opponents and the world map is randomly generated with every new game.</desc>

		<desc>San Francisco 2016. A series of earthquakes has damaged several nuclear power plants, and the subsequent nuclear contamination has forced the survivors to flee underground. Their only hope to get off the continent is to use newly developed matter transporters. However, these transporters require certain types of crystals to work. Since men cannot survive on the surface, the task of collecting the crystals is assigned to a cyborg.

You take control of the cyborg and must collect different types of crystals in a number of side-scrolling levels, while fighting off mutated animals. Your cyborg can jump, shoot and use smart bombs that damage everything on screen. From time to time, extras appear that replenish some of your health or improve your weapon. If your weapon is at maximum power, you can also collect additional smart bombs. 

The main task of each level is to collect crystals and use them in one of the teleporters that can be found at each end of a level.
There are three types of crystals that are used for different purposes. Green crystal teleport you to the other end of a level. Red crystals take you to another level and blue crystals are needed to get to another continent. Usage of the crystals is rather complicated as each crystal has a different charge and they have to be put into the right slot of the teleporters. Not paying attention to the charge may even cause the transporter to explode.</desc>

		<desc>The message used our frequency, but it didn't come from any of our commanders. It couldn't be! After verifying its content, there was no room for doubt: a spaceship of our defense forces of the future had problems, but it had problems in our time. How was that possible?

The ship has been infiltrated by foreign forces and was going to crash in the Arctic zone, which was under enemy control. The question arose immediately -- Could they seize our technology of the future...? It can't be allowed!

Our best man must go into the enemy base to reach the rest of the ship and take off. Objective: to obtain our technology of the future. The mission doesn't seem easy. For that reason, it has been entrusted to Derdhal, who had already been victorious in dangerous missions in Army Moves and Navy Moves (with the same gaming style), demonstrating a deep knowledge of all the guerrilla techniques and expertise in handling computer networks. The U-92 submarine leads you to the enemy base. When you are above the frozen surface of the Arctic, there will be no return. Your first mission will start. Good Luck! You cannot fail.</desc>

		<desc>This multi-section space-based game was coded by Reflections, the team behind Shadow of the Beast. The plot involves an attempt to get across a harsh galaxy despite not having the funds or firepower to make it. 

To reach each planet the player has to progress through numerous action sections, starting with some overhead-view shooting of rocks which break into progressively smaller blocks, a scanner tells the player roughly where they are located. This is followed by an into the screen shoot-out against an enemy flying backwards and forwards, and then the final approach to the trading centre, which involves the player progressing on foot from an overhead view, and sees contact with the enemies lose time rather than energy – the player has 3 attempts to get there in time.

Once the player reaches the planet, a trading aspect comes into play. Strategic purchase of the right equipment to boost the ship, as well as extra shields and firepower (which can be balanced depending on the next level).</desc>

		<desc>Not to be confused with Barbarian II: Dungeons of Drax - a game by Palace Software - Barbarian II is a direct sequel to an action/point’n’click hybrid released four years earlier. Developed by Pandamonium Entertainment and published by the legendary Psygnosis (Shadow of the Beast, Ork, Agony), the game continues the tale of Hegor the Barbarian.

After being improperly defeated some years ago, evil lord Necron has been reincarnated by one of his cult followers. Now only Hegor is strong, courageous, and stupid enough to face Necron and his minions.

Unlike the original Barbarian, which was an action game with a bizarre point’n’click control interface, Barbarian II plays just like a typical action/adventure title with a maze-like layout. During his adventures, Hegor will visit many interesting locales like a forest full of thugs, werewolves and spiky pits, a long, long cave, a semi-friendly human city, a dungeon, and finally Necron’s temple. All areas are huge, confusing, and full of enemies and traps.</desc>

		<desc>Bargon Attack is one of the less known adventures from Coktel Vision, though it was one of the first that introduced the unique interface that was used in many Coktel games that followed.  It was also one of the first of Coktel's games to use FMV technology in cut-scenes.

The gameplay is a mix of science fiction, cyberpunk and comedy elements. It takes place in the near future when an alien race named Bargon conquered the Earth and enslaved its people. You take a role of the young programmer who decides to put an end to the cruel aliens. You'll travel through 20 or so locations. Each one consists of 1 to 3 screens, similar to other Coktel games.

Along your travels, you'll face dangerous creatures and some strange alien technology. There are some occasions when you can die (though the option to replay the level is always available), plus the game also features several arcade sequences.</desc>

		<desc>The Black Cauldron is the video game adaptation of the unfamous eponym Disney movie from 1985. You play Taran, apprentice pig keeper who has to prevent the malicious Horned King to obtain the black cauldron and create his undead army. The gameplay is similar to the other Sierra games from this period (Space Quest II or King's Quest III): it's an adventure game – point &amp; click where you control the main character to walk, run, swim, talk to other characters… The interface is quite simple and the game not very difficult which makes it quite approachable. One of the game subtlety is that you can play it to follow the original story but being more creative will bring you more points and an alternate ending (up to 6).</desc>

		<desc>Buffalo Bill presents a collection of six Wild West themed mini-games, which hang together around humour-lead presentation and backdrops.You can play as many or as few of these as you like, and can always have another go at them if you fail.

First task is to throw knives at a spinning board upon which a surely-terrified and fortunately-skinny lady is locked  - make sure to adjust for the rotation that will occur in the time your shot takes to hit. You get points for missing as many times as possible before hitting. Event 2 is based on shooting ability and is in two stages. First you must shoot the targets of criminals (but not innocents) as they emerge from the ground, next you must shoot the bottles they throw at you from over the horizon.

Event 3 is Calf Roping, in which you must position yourself so as to be able to throw your rope around the poor cow's neck. This is followed by Bronco Riding, in which you must adjust your balance to compensate for the Bronco trying to throw you off, by pushing the joystick out to balance two bars. Level 5 starts off like the Cow Roping, as you jump onto a Steer, before a joystick-waggling section starts. Last of all is a side-scrolling game in which you jump onto a stagecoach which has been invaded by Indians, and beat up the hijacker.</desc>

		<desc>You awake in prison, without the memory of who you are, where you are and why you are imprisoned. In the corner of your cell you find a briefcase computer, which gives you the control over a unit of four droids. Now you must use these droids to find yourself, and free yourself.
With the help of the droids you explore tech-dungeons (its a SF-setting, but the feeling is like fantasy rpgs with robots and droids) and seek information, which lead to the next planet(s) on a path, which end marks your cell.
The Movement and Fighting is similar to games like Eye of the Beholder, but you can buy weapons and droid-parts in shops. The droids haven't levels like in normal rpgs, you must buy upgrades for the different parts of the droids, which make them stronger and faster. You can also buy a variety of chips, which allow the droids to see in darkness, invert the gravity or simple to shield a little period of time.</desc>

		<desc>You awake in prison, without the memory of who you are, where you are and why you are imprisoned. In the corner of your cell you find a briefcase computer, which gives you the control over a unit of four droids. Now you must use these droids to find yourself, and free yourself.
With the help of the droids you explore tech-dungeons (its a SF-setting, but the feeling is like fantasy rpgs with robots and droids) and seek information, which lead to the next planet(s) on a path, which end marks your cell.
The Movement and Fighting is similar to games like Eye of the Beholder, but you can buy weapons and droid-parts in shops. The droids haven't levels like in normal rpgs, you must buy upgrades for the different parts of the droids, which make them stronger and faster. You can also buy a variety of chips, which allow the droids to see in darkness, invert the gravity or simple to shield a little period of time.</desc>

		<desc>High In the Andes, a biting wind howls through the Incas' ruined strongholds. Half a world away, the Pharaohs' tombs lie empty. In Italy, the Roman Colosseum decays. Everywhere, you see remnants of societies that thought they would endure forever. All are dust. But yours could be different. You could be the one person in history who builds an empire that never falls. That's the challenge of Civilization, the most enthralling "god game" yet developed. From the creator of Railroad Tycoon —the SPA's 1990 Strategy Game of the Year —Civilization lets you match wits with history's greatest leaders. You start at the dawn of recorded history-4,000 B.C. and the founding of the first cities—then nurture your society toward the Space Age. In the beginning, you'll labor to simply survive while building your settlements, discovering new technologies and fending off barbarians. As your empire prospers, you'll face competing civilizations guided by history's most legendary figures: Alexander the Great, Napoleon, Genghis Khan, Julius Caesar and more. Now you'll test your capacity for expansion and domination, your ability to outwit and outmaneuver those cunning and brilliant leaders.</desc>

		<desc>In the game you play a role of the special agent Cougar. Your mission is to penetrate the criminal's fortress to retrieve an information on new drug. The game is divided on three parts of different styles.

First one is side-scrolling action in different locations such as prison, mines, or temple. For example, you begin in the prison, from where you must escape finding the keys to open doors, fighting the guards with martial arts, avoiding the grenades and lethal obstacles, acquiring the gun, and finally jumping into the plane. 

Second one is a flight simulator. For example, you have to control a plane, flying over the territory and shooting enemy planes with gun or missiles.

Third one is a motorcycle riding. You have to reach the checkpoint for 3:00 before blowing up.</desc>

		<rating />
		<desc>This multi-genre game represents famous historical events of World War II called D-Day and related to operation "Overlord", when Allies attack Axis massively in France.

The game proposes to be a general in command of Allies group and optionally perform certain actions by yourself also. Such actions include:
1. Piloting a plane over French territory to bomb strategically important places; 
2. Landing on hostile territory as paratrooper; 
3. Breaking through enemy lines as infantry soldier; 
4. Driving a tank and fighting as a tank team with enemies in French village.

All kinds of gameplay differ in looks from 1st or 3rd person perspective in simulator-like missions (tank and plane respectively) to isometric (infantry) and platform (paratrooper) with corresponding actions made in all of them. All such military actions may be played as single missions or combined and also strategically managed on the map during a real-time approach in Overlord campaign. The game progress may be saved to be restored later.

Multiple options allow to turn off participation in certain or all military actions as well as adjust enemy actions including even such event as 'Hitler does not wake up'.</desc>

		<desc>It is the end of the 31st century. Nearly one thousand years ago man colonized the moon, and from there created a range of human mutations which were left to develop other planets. At the same time, life on earth was destroyed by a cataclysmic climate change.

Now the mutant races are at war with each other, and man has returned to Earth, rebuilt civilization, and forgotten about past adventures.

Deep in Earth City, plans have been made to explore space again. The race has started to develop Earth's resources, to research new technology, to build for future adventures.

You must control the training, research, resources, production and stores of Earth City in a complex strategic battle to maximize the planet's supplies. You must construct and pilot the hi-tech space shuttles and ships needed for mankind to venture out into the furthest reaches of the warturn solar system.

		<desc>It is the end of the 31st century. Nearly one thousand years ago man colonized the moon, and from there created a range of human mutations which were left to develop other planets. At the same time, life on earth was destroyed by a cataclysmic climate change.

Now the mutant races are at war with each other, and man has returned to Earth, rebuilt civilization, and forgotten about past adventures.

Deep in Earth City, plans have been made to explore space again. The race has started to develop Earth's resources, to research new technology, to build for future adventures.

You must control the training, research, resources, production and stores of Earth City in a complex strategic battle to maximize the planet's supplies. You must construct and pilot the hi-tech space shuttles and ships needed for mankind to venture out into the furthest reaches of the warturn solar system. 
Operation Deuteros has begun.</desc>

		<desc>A scientist obsessed with Picasso's cubist paintings develops a weapon that turns everything to cubes. The United Kingdom sends a secret agent to revert the affected objects and monuments back to their original state.

Devious Designs is a puzzle game where geometric shapes have to be assembled. The player controls a 007-style secret agent that has the ability to walk on the walls, lift heavy objects and shoot. Using these, he must drag and drop the geometric pieces scattered on the screen (by standing next to them and holding the fire button) on translucent slots. Each level is a screen with a timer on the top. When the counter runs out, the level is reset and the player looses one life. Like in Bubble Bobble, various objects fall from the screen that can be collected for points, along with more useful power-ups like explosives, extra-time, extra-lives and a special block than fills a slot (it can be shot if it's not needed). Also, if the player takes too long to solve the level a random enemy appears, but it can be killed by the agent's gun.

The game starts with 6 lives and has a password system.</desc>

Try to shot down the opponent, avoid getting hit and avoid the large airship who floats around in the airspace. If you fly too high you will lose control of the airplane and it will crash. Sometimes a truck driving at the bottom of the screen will fire a surface-to-air missile making the situation a bit harder to manage.</desc>

Dirk the Daring is controlled by the player, who views Dirk's actions on the screen from third-person. The game is reactive and players must press the right controller direction or action button at the right time to have Dirk avoid traps, defeat monsters and otherwise stay alive.</desc>

The prophecy has been fulfilled. The world shall be ruled by the dragons. On an island far away, their lords prepare for the conquest of the lands. There is only one hope for mankind. The emperor sends out four heroes -- warriors and magicians -- to solve the puzzle of tears and prevent the invasion of the Drakkhen.

Drakkhen is a role-playing game with several ingenious features for its time. The eye-catcher is a mix of fast 3D landscapes and 2D interiors. The player's party will travel overland on a flat terrain made up of vectors, on which 2D objects are zoomed (The same type of engine was later used in Eternam). The player will encounter monsters and fight them in real-time combat, and discover the palaces of the dragon lords. Indoors, the player has to find a way through the maze of chambers, solving puzzles and defeating the minions of the Drakkhen. Party members are depicted in four status windows on the left side of the screen, thus allowing to see their current status and equipment at once.</desc>

The player's party will travel overland on a flat terrain made up of vectors, on which 2D objects are zoomed (The same type of engine was later used in Eternam). The player will encounter monsters and fight them in real-time combat, and discover the palaces of the dragon lords. Indoors, the player has to find a way through the maze of chambers, solving puzzles and defeating the minions of the Drakkhen. Party members are depicted in four status windows on the left side of the screen, thus allowing to see their current status and equipment at once.</desc>

The game features two worlds: the Underworld of Fire and the Arctic Earth, which must be unlocked in order to reach the third, the Castle of Transylvania (Elvira's property by inheritance) . Elvira can use spells and weapons, as well as collect rune stones, food in order to replenish their health, and treasure chests. If she encounters difficulty in completing a segment of her current quest, she may purchase information from a trader, found within each level, using rune stones as a currency.</desc>

		<desc>The sun is about to go supernova and humanity must find a new home. All the population is packed into a huge fleet of ships and they set off for a suitable planet. Unfortunately the route goes straight through the territory of a hostile alien race, the Rexxons. 

The game is a space shooter but you also get surface missions on different planets. The main emphasis on the game is the graphics which were excellent when the game was released but this meant that the game was very short with just 7 levels. There are loads of cutscenes all with music from Holst's planet suite.</desc>

		<desc>The sun is about to go supernova and humanity must find a new home. All the population is packed into a huge fleet of ships and they set off for a suitable planet. Unfortunately the route goes straight through the territory of a hostile alien race, the Rexxons. 

The game is a space shooter but you also get surface missions on different planets. The main emphasis on the game is the graphics which were excellent when the game was released but this meant that the game was very short with just 7 levels. There are loads of cutscenes all with music from Holst's planet suite.</desc>

		<desc>The second in the series features campaigns in Lybia, the Persian Gulf, The Middle East and Vietnam, making for a total of 250,000 miles of potential action and danger. Primary and secondary aerial and ground-based targets must be destroyed on each of these. You are armed with a cannon, AMRAAM long-range air-to-air missile, Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missile, and the Maverick air-to-ground missile.

11 camera angles including internal and external views of the plane exist. To help new players there is a training mode, with options to disable crashes and automate take-off and landing. Enemy AI is responsive, but a targeting computer helps you take them out before they can do it to you. The game incorporates two "Director's Modes" which cuts away from your cockpit to highlight special events occurring elsewhere in the game world, like enemy base launching fighters, SAM sites launching SAMs, and your missiles hitting the target.</desc>

		<desc>Rule the night! Take the pride of American Stealth technology and take on the best the Warsaw pact technology can offer! Dodge between radars, sneak under enemy fighters, and take out your primary objectives and secondary objectives with your limited weapons onboard, then make your way home. Can you survive all the way to general and win the Congressional Medal of Honor?

F-19 Stealth Fighter was based around Sid Meier's closest estimate of the stealth fighter based on the data available at the time. You get full 3D graphics, 3D enemies, random objectives and enemy dispositions (so each mission will be different), dynamic radar effectiveness that depends on your position and radar cross section, enemies that search you out if you do "tickle" their defenses, even civilian aircrafts in the air, and ability to play in cold war, moderate war, or all-out war, with very different rules of engagement.</desc>

		<desc>Winwood was just an ordinary man, an owner of a small record shop - certainly not a very suitable profession for someone who would become a hero in a magical land. But fate had its own plans for our hero. One day, feeling particularly drowsy, Winwood closed his shop and fell asleep on the sofa. Soon his dream turned into a nightmare: he realized he was trapped in his own dream world, a fantasy land with mages and ferocious monsters, unable to wake up. An old man named Naristos explained to him that a mysterious mage known as Thardan has been terrorizing the land for a long time. Thardan's power might be the only solution to Winwood's predicament. As a traveler between the worlds, Winwood alone stands the chance of getting close to Thardan, and perhaps ridding the magical land of his tyranny. Fate: Gates of Dawn is a first-person role-playing game with turn-based combat, similar in visual style and gameplay to Wizardry and Bard's Tale games. The player can recruit up to 28 characters, resulting in four parties that can be controlled separately. A notable feature of the game is a day/night cycle with weather effects that influence the behavior of the world's inhabitants. For example, less creatures will venture outside if it is raining; the player can choose to cast the Rain spell to reduce the number of hostile encounters. There is a total of 32 different character classes in the game; many of them are traditional (like Wizard or Cleric), but there are also many exotic ones, such as for example Nymph, Banshee, Valkyrie, and others. Each class has abilities and spells associated with it. The world of the game is inhabited by eleven races, each with its own background history.</desc>

		<desc>All right, boys and girls. You're in for quite a treat with Fiendish Freddy's Big Top O' Fun. We have not one, not two, but six, count 'em six, zany games of circus excitement. Yes, friends, a real sports-o-rama. Soon you'll be the talk of your neighborhood as you compete in the death-defying events in this circus extravaganza. And a word to the wise-watch out for that rascal of a saboteur, that do-er of dastardly deeds, that vindictive victim of the rare form of dementia known as circusus interruptus-the one, the only, Fiendish Freddy.
And now, from the home office in Northbrook, IL, here are the top five reasons why you should play Fiendish Freddy's Big Top O' Fun:
Number 5: Because this program contains not one, but two scantily-clad, fully-endowed babes.
Number 4: Because you can do this by yourself and not go blind.
Number 3: Because it will help stimulate the economy-particularly ours.
Number 2: Because we left circus tickets for Elvis at the will-call window.
And the number one reason...Because we offer breakthrough animation, dazzling graphics, slapstick, cartoon-style humor, and big time big top fun. And because we said so!</desc>

Intending to play a prank on his angry boss, the unlikely hero discovers a secret passage leading to a time machine along with mysterious alien documents. Operating the device transports the protagonist to the year 1304, where he is given a seemingly ordinary task of rescuing a lady in danger. However, he soon finds out about a much more serious threat of a global alien invasion. The hero has to travel to the remote future of the 44th century and eventually to the even more remote past of the Cretaceous period to foil their plans.</desc>

		<desc>You are strapped into a spaceship to take on five dangerous settings, ranging from a pleasant garden to hostile fire and tough ice. You will have to fly freely before cutting through tunnels and canyons, and finally destroying an alien base. Your energy read out starts at 1200 and decreases as shots hit you, or you make contact with a wall or blockage. You have infinite cannons and guided missiles to help you along. You can get regular energy recharges and power upgrades, by shooting and then collecting their carrier pods.</desc>

		<desc>Gauntlet, the original arcade smash hit, is a fighting game where you choose a character and let rip into the hordes of enemies that assault you on you way to the end of the level. One or two players must make their way through 100 levels of mayhem and magic. 

It featured a choice of four characters to play with, each with different weapons. Thor the Warrior, has a  bludgeoning battle axe, Thyra the Valkyrie, has a close range sword, Questor the Elf has his long range bow, and Merlin the Wizard has magical bolts.

Ghosts, goblins and even the life draining Death are your enemies. Enemies stream out of generators, so destroy these before tackling the rest. 

Keys are needed to open the many doors within the levels, and in some situations a door will contain only bonus items, not a progressive route.  Scattered magic potions act like smart bombs and clear the screen of all enemies. Beware of poison though, this reduces your energy level.
Treasure is abundant throughout the levels and adds to your score.</desc>

		<desc>Gobliiins is an adventure game where the player controls a team of three goblins: Oups, Ignatius and Asgard (Hooter, Dwayne, and BoBo in the US release) to find four magic components. A voodoo doll has turned their king Angoulafre mad and by collecting the components they can track down Niak the Wizard, the only one who can put things right. The player needs to solve various puzzles by combining the different skills of the three goblins. It's possible switch between them and control them separately. Most of the puzzles are based on coordinated actions. One can cast powerful but erratic spells, another can collect and use objects, and the last can hit things. Action icons are activated at the bottom of the screen. The game takes in 22 landscapes, each of which has puzzles which must be cleared. The characters have limited energy, which can be sapped by traps.</desc>

		<desc>You play as Heimdall, a demi-god based in Norse mythology. Heimdall's job is to protect the entrance to Asgard, the home of the gods, from all evil, including the terrible Ragnarok, when all the evil forces come together to try and destroy the gods and ultimately everything. Unfortunately Ragnarok is on its way and if that wasn't bad enough, Loki, god of mischief, has hidden Thor's hammer, Odin's sword and Frey's spear in three lands: the land of men (Midgard), the land of giants (Utgard) and the land of the gods (Asgard). You, as the newly mortalized Heimdall, must visit each of these lands to collect the god's weapons. Each land has around 15 islands and each island has countless rooms.</desc>

The gameplay consists of horizontal fighting with a maze like map using doors to change the view.  The party consists of the 8 Heroes of the Lance, using one at a time and the player can switch between them at any time.  Each character has different types of attacks and spells making them more suited to fighting different enemies as well as acting as lives.

		<desc>Peter Banning is an ordinary suburban dad with two kids - or so everyone thinks. What not even his family know is his past as Peter Pan, scourge of Captain Hook in JM Barrie's children's fiction. Captain Hook gains revenge on Banning by stealing his two children, so Peter must return to Neverland, return to eternal childhood, and get them back.

It's a point and click adventure, and the pirate setting ensures that it recalls the Monkey Island games. The top 2/3 of the screen features a visual depiction of the area Peter is in, which a row of icons along the bottom can be selected to alter the function of a mouse click. These include looking at an object, picking it up, talking to people, using objects to solve problems (often in combination with others), and giving objects to others.</desc>

		<desc>In today's moral climate, it seems that almost everyone is living by the rule 'kill or be killed'. Some people are taking the idea to extremes, plunging into danger just to prove that they are really tough and a lot stupider than the rest. 

In this game, players control Kwon, dubbed the Human Killing Machine. He has vowed to demonstrate the power of his homeland; and does this by battling a series of opponents in several countries such as Moscow, Amsterdam, and Barcelona. HKM uses the term 'knockdown' for players who defeat their current opponent. Three knockdowns are needed for the player to move onto the next opponent.

Bonus points are awarded for the remaining energy Kwon has when he has successfully defeated his opponent. The player has five lives, and if all of them are used up, the game is over.</desc>

		<desc>Ishar 2: Messengers of Doom is the sequel to Ishar: Legend of the Fortress.

Following the defeat of Krogh and the banishment of the powers of chaos, Ishar became a cultural and intellectual centre in Kendoria. Over time people came to the island and settled there and a city, named ''Zach's Island'' developed. Shandar, a monk of chaos, entered the city along with settlers from the northern lands. His trading in hallucinogens soon made him rich and powerful. Eventually Shandar controlled ''Zach's Island'' and had many followers and worshippers. He built a strong fortress, a second Ishar, to challenge the empire.

In the sequel you can import saved characters from Ishar, or create your own team.

In the game you have to explore the magic land (dungeons, tree-cities, mountain paths with real graded height effect), fight the enemies, join the allies and relax in towns, which even have medieval nightclubs.

Now the area is 3 times bigger, and innovation is your ability to use pet animals as allies in battles, and create magic potions. There are day and night cycles.</desc>

This hovers around the middle of the skyscrapers, creating a claustrophobic low level experience (and a different feel to the many other flight simulations set in the city, such as F/A-18 Interceptor).

In this maelstrom, the Black Angel gang is terrorising the public. The player is a member of the SFPD Police force, charged with bringing them down throughout ten missions. Some are out-and-out action while others are more strategic. You can only survive for 20 minutes in the smog, so time is crucial in these missions.</desc>

		<desc>Following Alexander's escape from the evil wizard Manannan, return to Daventry and rescue of Rosella from the three-headed dragon in King's Quest III, king Graham is ready to pass on his adventure cap to one of his children. While the cap flings through the air, Graham is unexpectedly struck by heavy pain in his chest and falls to the ground. Death is near for Graham and, while the royal family watches over him, Rosella retreats to the throne room, weeping in despair. At that moment a fairy calls her though the magic mirror. Fairy Genesta offers Rosella the chance to heal her father. In the land of Tamir there is magic tree which bears just one fruit every hundred years, a fruit which heals all disease and provides its consumer with a long healthy life. However, the only way for Rosella to be able to return to Daventry is by also helping the fairy. Genesta has lost her life-giving talisman to the evil fairy Lolotte, who lives in the mountains of Tamir. Rosella will have to infiltrate and gain Lolotte's trust to be able to recover Genesta's talisman, a task which will require the accomplishment of several dangerous assignments. Rosella will have to find a unicorn, a magic hen and Pandora's box and bring them to Lolotte. On her adventure she will confront ghosts, ogres, zombies, a mummy, witches and many more characters in this fourth installment of the King's Quest series. Time is of the essence. Rosella has just one day to help Genesta, find the fruit and return to Daventry to save her dying father.</desc>

		<desc>Based on Avalon Hill's board game of the same name, Kingmaker is a strategy game set during the War of the Roses period of medieval England. You can play either York, or Lancaster, and your goal is to get your choice for royal heir crowned king of England. You do this by granting titles to people favorable to your cause, and eliminating those who would oppose it. Kingmaker has a simplistic combat interface, rather concentrating on politics and dirty tricks as the strategies of choice.</desc>

		<desc>A team of adventurers seek out four magic objects in the dungeons of Dunshelm: The Shield of Justice, the Sword of Freedom, the Cup of Life and the Crown of Glory. Equipped with these, they hope to destroy the evil Lord Fear. Treguard, the dungeon master of the Knightmare castle, appears as an oracle to help in their quest.

Knightmare is a role-playing game and the second videogame adaptation of the homonymous British television series. It is very similar to the games of the Captive series, as it was developed by the same author. As in those games the interface is mouse-based, clearly inspired by the Dungeon Master one: the left mouse-button interacts with the environment, while the right button executes character actions. Movement can be controlled by left-clicking on the movement buttons on the screen or by using the keyboard. Once a weapon or an object is equipped, clicking on it brings up a menu with its actions. Knives, for example, have a menu with "stab", "swing" and "hack". A empty hand shows a menu with "punch" and "kick". The wand shows a list of available spells.

The game allows saving at any moment, but only loads saved games through the start menu. This means that in order to load a saved game, the player has to reset the game or intentionally kill the party.</desc>

Collect icons that will help in the enhancement of your armor, gain an extra life and coins to spend in the shop for new weapons. Be sure not to collect any skull icons or else it will call Thanatos' Ethereal Presence where you will have to use Rune Bombs to destroy it. After you complete one of the 3 worlds, you will be given a password so you can resume later after running out of lives.</desc>

		<desc>Legend of Faerghail is role-playing game with an interface similar to that of the Bard´s Tale Series or Dragon Wars, although it is a little more complex.

You can create a party of six members and then try to stop a crusade of slaughter of the elvish race, that has been corrupted by an unspeakable evil. The game is played across 8 large dungeons with over 1000 rooms each, with 80 different foes in total. The game is very complex and therefore intended for an experienced player only...</desc>

		<desc>Loom is an adventure game from LucasFilm. What sets Loom apart from other adventure games (in direct comparison with Sierra's) is its unique interface: you do not carry items around, but rather manipulate existing items through the use of spells. The spells themselves are woven through playing magical notes on a special distaff. Loom also features three difficultly levels, and differentiates them by changing the way the interface works: Standard features the distaff at the bottom of the screen but notes aren't written, whereas Expert doesn't have the distaff and you have to replay the spells by hearing alone.

In Loom you play the role of Bobbin Threadbare, a young man from the Guild of Weavers who just turned 17. Although you do not know why, you are outcast from the guild and blamed for the lack of prosperity in recent times.
After the Council of Elders is attacked and the Elders are turned into swans, you as Bobbin must set forth on a journey to find the swans and try to restore order to the Guild of Weavers.</desc>

		<desc>Private investigator Tex Murphy is hired to investigate the murder of a university professor. It turns out that he was one of eight scientists involved in Project Overlord, a mission to remotely control people. You soon learn of the deaths of other related figures. Suspects may include the British intelligence head, a surveillance company owner, and the professor's daughter.

Tex's first adventure (and the only one released for systems other than DOS or Windows PCs) takes you through the seedy West Coast world of 2033. The game is icon-driven, with object puzzles less significant than detective deduction and character interaction. 

Mean Streets features dozens of characters to interact with by asking questions or offering bribes. Fights often arise, but a diplomatic approach is more successful with characters whose guilt is unproven. Although it is largely an adventure game, travel between cities involves piloting your Lotus Speeder in a flight simulation section.</desc>

		<desc>The people of the Midwinter Isle have abandoned their homeland to join forces with the people of Agora, forming the Atlantic Federation. Their arch enemies, the Saharan Empire, control every one of the forty two Atlantic islands except Agora, running them as slave colonies. Resentment of the Saharans runs high, and as a special agent of the Atlantic Federation, you are charged with completing dangerous top secret missions designed to initiate rebellion on the islands.
But the Saharans are also planning to invade Agora. It is a race against time free as many islands as possible, before the mighty Saharan armada sets sail for battle with your home island - and you !</desc>

Gameplay is a sort of reverse Chase H.Q., as you aim to flee Sheriff Sam's staff, without destroying your car or running out of time. As well as typical car upgrades, between stages you can also buy maps, which will help you plan your route.

The game's atmosphere includes banjo-based background music and CB radio sounds, for that authentic Midwest feel.</desc>

During the travels, Nicky is able to move around the levels, jump over obstacles, and duck to avoid flying threats. Nicky must collect gems, flying bombs, dynamite, keys, and other specific objects. These are used for tasks such as building a bridge over river throwing logs, climbing ladders, using teleporters, or to break the walls to find the secret areas. 

Enemy creatures are taken out by throwing apple remnants at them or jumping on them. Nicky's energy is drained if he makes contact with them in any other way. As you do all this, a score is calculated, and then listed in the high score table. Passwords are offered to allow you to resume from a previously-reached level.</desc>

		<desc>Shadow Warriors is a direct port of the arcade version of Ninja Gaiden. It is a beat'em up in the veins of Double Dragon featuring Ryu Hayabusa, a ninja who must fight members of an evil cult who seek to fulfil Nostradamus' end of the world prophecies.

Ryu Hayabusa can attack his enemies using his his bare hands and feet or using a sword (for a limited time). He can also perform moves such as a flying neck throw, a back flip and hang kicks, performed while hanging in scenario objects. Throwing enemies against objects such as phone cabins, oil drums or dumpsters will destroy them, revealing power ups such as health items and swords. At some points, Ryu will have to perform acrobatic moves to carry on. He has a life bar starting with 5 units.

The game takes place in United States' locations such as Las Vegas, North Carolina, Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon and Brooklyn. The enemies in those stages are mostly of the same 5 kinds, including Jason Vorhees' look-alikes and other masked men. There is a boss fight at the end of each stage.

A two-player co-operative game is also featured. Whenever the player dies, a continue screen will appear showing Ryu chained to a table while a circular saw descends upon him.</desc>

The gameplay consists of a combination of arcade elements and first person view much like Eye of the Beholder and Dungeon Master.  One of the more remarkable features is in the first person mode, rather than having just 4 directs to face and flicking between them there are 8 directions and the view scrolls smoothly as you turn. This smooth scrolling continues when you move forward, giving the game more of a 3D feel.

The arcade elements consist of horizontal scrolling areas where you fight enemies with your bow while avoiding their attacks.  Later you encounter a similar type of gameplay that involves exploring castles and adds 4 directional movement.</desc>

		<desc>Operation Thunderbolt is the exciting sequel to Operation Wolf. An airliner is hijacked by terrorists en-route from Paris to Boston, who threaten to kill all hostages on board if their mates aren't released from jail. Instead of reaching its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for the ride.

There are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.

You also have a life bar to worry about. If you're shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, and once you're energy is depleted,  you lose one of your three lives. You can lose a lot of energy by killing hostages on purpose,  and you can't easily avoid killing them if you decide to use rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth mission, the mission that involves you fighting terrorists on a plane,  proves to be difficult because a woman in a blue dress stands up and gets in the line of fire, and you have to very careful when you're going to use rocket bombs.

There are two endings to this game, and which ending you can watch will depend on the number of hostages you've saved, and whether or not you shot the pilot instead of the mission eight boss.</desc>

		<desc>You have been recruited for Operation Wolf, a desperate attempt to rescue prisoners from the enemy. Through a series of missions, you'll engage a variety of enemies, from soldiers to ninjas, patrol boats to helicopters, and more. Can you carry the day?

Operation Wolf is an arcade conversion of the game by Taito. It is essentially a bitmapped "rail-shooter", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to "pick them up". Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds. 

You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around which can be shot, but it's not beneficial. 

Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.</desc>

		<desc>You have been recruited for Operation Wolf, a desperate attempt to rescue prisoners from the enemy. Through a series of missions, you'll engage a variety of enemies, from soldiers to ninjas, patrol boats to helicopters, and more. Can you carry the day?

Operation Wolf is an arcade conversion of the game by Taito. It is essentially a bitmapped "rail-shooter", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to "pick them up". Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds. 

You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around which can be shot, but it's not beneficial. 

Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.</desc>

		<desc>The Oriental Games offer skilled martial artists the chance to prove themselves in Kung Fu, Kendo and the relatively brutal Kyo-Kus-Hin-Kai., using “courage, skill and flare” (sic) according to the packaging. It makes for a series of one-on-one fights viewed from the side.

Kendo involves using a stick as your weapon, whereas Kung Fu various punches and kicks and Kyo-Kus-Hin-Kai involves head butts and flying attacks. You can jump over opponents; a quick tap of the fire button turns you around. You have an energy bar with 5 blocks of gradually decreasing colours, which drops when you are hit and increases as you pass time without being hit. Impressive moves earn you bonus Merit Awards.

On the 16-bit versions, there are 3 skill levels (Novice, Professional and Master), digitised sound, and an editor to set up joystick moves. The 8-bit versions lack these niceties, but include an extra discipline, Sumo; these are played in sequence rather than by choice.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, an evil demon called Satan has spread chaos in the world, and someone has to stop him. This is where you come in. 
Playing as the hero Perseus, you have to go to 5 different worlds, each with its own theme, and kill Satan's guardians (end of level bosses). 
A friendly wizard has also given you a magical flying horse called Pegasus, to help you in your quest.

Each world has 10 levels, and half of them are played flying on Pegasus back, and the other half walking, without your magical horse. When flying, the game plays like a Shoot'em up, but when walking, it's a platform game, and you have to rely on your sword.

You can buy weapon upgrades and other bonuses, if you collect enough diamonds. They can be found spread out all over the levels, and fallen enemies drop them sometimes as well. If your health drops too low, you can also heal yourself by spending some diamonds.

After every world, you get a password, letting you continue from the same place the next time you play. That's fortunate, because this game takes a long time to complete.</desc>

		<desc>Ever wanted to race dune buggies at high speed on a variety of tracks? Power Drift is an arcade racer that gives you the chance to do just that.

There are 5 tracks to choose from, each with 5 stages. The stages range from cities, to deserts to tracks over water. There are also 12 drivers to pick from, from businessmen to skinheads and mohicans. 

Your buggy has 2 gears, high and low. Once the light goes green, just keep the pedal to the metal. You’ll need to place third or higher to continue to the next stage. Be careful not to bump into other buggies or objects next to the road. While you’re buggy can take a pounding, crashing will slow you down. 

Finish all 5 stages in a level and you’ll be presented with a bonus level.</desc>

		<desc>Powermonger takes the basic design and concepts of Bullfrog's previous game Populous, and places it in a war context. The game cast the player as a dispossessed warlord plundering his way through 195 territories on the way to world conquest. Several other leaders have the same goal.

The gameworld is now made up of polygons, so the view can be rotated and moved with greater freedom than Populous. Trade, diplomacy, inventions, and scorched earth invasions all play a key role in how the player progressed through the game.  Two-player games via modem links are available on computer versions.</desc>

The game is a crosshair shooter influenced by Operation Wolf. The viewpoint is from slightly behind Harrington, while the game scrolls on as you clear each section. Mouse control is offered on 16-bit versions. Your armour must be kept functional by collecting top-ups, and there are weapon power-ups such as machine guns and rocket launchers to be had. You can't go in all-guns-blazing however, as killing a single innocent causes Harrington to lose his job</desc>

		<desc>You're playing a small ant that is willing to help a friend in rather inconvenient situation. Apparently, your friend, doggie, likes to eat cookies that has his picture on their box, and he got himself so carried away that he lost the balance, and a bag of cookies fell deep down into an ant-hill. Now, you're goin' in, in a mission of solving puzzles, and retrieving the cookies for your friend.

Now, this ant-hill is a bit different from the ones you saw, and especially from the one you live in. It's path is filled up with boulders, and all the gates, and you must travel the quest to find the cookies. After each different place inside, you'll fins a small bag of cookie, and bring it back to your friend doggie.

The main quest consists of you carrying your-size boulders, and placing them in a well imagined line, so when you push the exact one, all must fall, and the one that marks the end must fall the last, or the door will stay shut permanently. Beside we know that ants are very easy, and can live almost every fall, you cannot practice that, so if you jusp from a little bit too high position, don't expect much, but to retry the level.

Every block, or boulder in a game has a different markings. Like for example, the yellow ones are bricks you can push, and they will just as easily fall, and push, or not, the brick in front of it. The red ones will do the opposite, you cannot push them, and if the yellow, or any other brick hits it, it'll continue falling back to the other side. Some bricks explode when you push them, or other brick hits them, and that way they leave the hole, so your brick can continue spining, or yet again, not. Some spin without stop, 'til they hit some other brick that can fall, some replaces the spaces, like building a bridge on that place, some go high and when hit the top, they stick to it, and push, or not, the brick in front of them. Anyway, that's the game basics.

Each level gives you the new code/password, so you can continue from the position where you ended each time you type that code. Perspective of your ant is like in any other platform game, and you control it with arrow keys, or joystick. But beware, the time is clicking, so you'll have to solve each level in a hurry.</desc>

It's path is filled up with boulders, and all the gates, and you must travel the quest to find the cookies. After each different place inside, you'll fins a small bag of cookie, and bring it back to your friend doggie.

The main quest consists of you carrying your-size boulders, and placing them in a well imagined line, so when you push the exact one, all must fall, and the one that marks the end must fall the last, or the door will stay shut permanently. Beside we know that ants are very easy, and can live almost every fall, you cannot practice that, so if you jusp from a little bit too high position, don't expect much, but to retry the level.

Every block, or boulder in a game has a different markings. Like for example, the yellow ones are bricks you can push, and they will just as easily fall, and push, or not, the brick in front of it. The red ones will do the opposite, you cannot push them, and if the yellow, or any other brick hits it, it'll continue falling back to the other side. Some bricks explode when you push them, or other brick hits them, and that way they leave the hole, so your brick can continue spining, or yet again, not. Some spin without stop, 'til they hit some other brick that can fall, some replaces the spaces, like building a bridge on that place, some go high and when hit the top, they stick to it, and push, or not, the brick in front of them. Anyway, that's the game basics.

Each level gives you the new code/password, so you can continue from the position where you ended each time you type that code. Perspective of your ant is like in any other platform game, and you control it with arrow keys, or joystick. But beware, the time is clicking, so you'll have to solve each level in a hurry.</desc>

The game is set on the mean streets of Brooklyn, which you must venture through to meet your girlfriend, and then rescue her from her kidnappers. This is split into five levels, taking you through the subway and the docks as well as some inhospitable streets. A wide range of aggressive moves are on offer, including headbutts, kicks, punches and flying kicks. Much of the game's violence is depicted in a fairly tongue-in-cheek style, with an element of attempted humour along the way.</desc>

		<desc>In the far future humanity has achieved faster-than-light space travel, but the galaxy is still a big unknown place. To chart the stars and planets explorers named "Robinsons" are sent on scouting tours of duty. Most of the time the Robinsons sent away are individuals deemed dangerous to society and whose ships are sabotaged.

You play one of these Robinsons who gets stranded on a mysterious alien planet on which a telepathic woman is also stranded. As it turns out she knows a way to get off the planet, but she needs your help to escape.

Gameplay consists of first person roleplaying with the emphasis placed on character modeling and survival. Take a dip when it's cold and you'll sure catch the flu, don't treat an infected injury and amputation is on the way, etc. You must fashion your own tools from whatever you can find on the planet and the game uses pre-rendered sprites over voxel technology terrain for graphics.</desc>

		<desc>Savage contains three different parts, each with its own style. You can play all three, but to get more than one life on levels 2 or 3, you must first input the code earned on completing the previous level.

You play Savage, a muscular warrior who was imprisoned in a castle. When he broke free, he found out that his imprisonment had been a trick with the sole purpose of imprisoning his love, the maiden. You have to progress through the 3 parts of the game to rescue her. 

The first is a simple horizontal-scrolling shooter, in which you use the trajectory of your shots to kill enemies and collect the treasures and improved weapons they drop when killed. The second is a 1st person perspective 3D shooter resembling Space Harrier, with skulls to shoot and monoliths to avoid. In the third you play Savage's Eagle form, flying through platform-style levels avoiding timing-based hazards and shooting anyone who gets in your way. In this section bubbles can be shot to release power-ups</desc>

		<desc>Sega's take on the 1943 style of vertically scrolling shoot 'em ups was set in the future. Your fighter plane is aged and under-powered, yet you must face down large planes, tanks and ground targets to achieve victory. Each level ends with a close-viewed section of particular intensity before finally facing a boss. Smart bombs are occasionally found lying around, and can destroy everything on the screen, although you can't use them on the bosses. A simultaneous 2-player mode is provided.</desc>

		<desc>While very young, Aarbron was kidnapped and enslaved by the Priests of the Beast Lord. He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes the face. Of his father.
As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard.

Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit computer era is a side-scrolling platformer best known for the use of parallax scrolling along lush graphics, a musical score  by David Whittaker, a iconic cover by Roger Dean and what many consider to be unforgiving gameplay, balancing between the "very challenging" and the "impossible". The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.</desc>

		<desc>Using the same graphical interface as Deja Vu, Shadowgate is an adventure game set in a fantasy world. Players take the part of an adventurer sent to the ancient keep of Shadowgate on a quest to find a mystic artifact known as the Staff of Ages and stop the evil Warlock Lord from summoning a horrific demon known as the Behemoth. However Shadowgate has become infested with the Warlock Lord's demonic minions, not to mention the castle's still functional booby-traps.

Unlike Deja Vu, death comes at you suddenly, unexpectedly, and most of all OFTEN. Such simple acts as pulling the wrong switch or opening the wrong door can cause you to be skewered by a booby-trap or disemboweled by a monster. It's allso worth mentioning the fact that if your torch burns out (this happens quite regularly) and you forget to light a new one, you'll trip in the dark and break your neck.

Now, soaring at 17,000 miles per hour, 280 nautical miles above the earth, SHUTTLE enables you to fly numerous realistic missions in the Space Shuttle Orbiter.
Based on official government documents, SHUTTLE is the most accurate and comprehensive simulation of NASA's Space Shuttle ever produced for any home computer.
With the aid of Mission Control, you will master such challenges as deploying and repairing satellites, launching spy satellites, manoeuvring your craft in zero gravity, attaining the correct re-entry trajectory, and pulling of complicated landings.
Advance polygon and elliptical graphics along with actual land and star maps were used to create the breathtaking 3D panoramas of the Orbiter and its environment, which can be viewed from any angle at any time.</desc>

		<desc>Following the successful gameplay of Dragon's Lair, Don Bluth released this second conversion of his Laserdisc games series.

You're playing Dexter, a guy fighting the evil madman Borf who has kidnapped your girlfriend Kimberly and is now threatening the world with his dreaded weapon, the "Infanto Ray" which turns adults into small children.

The game plays like a comic strip - visuals are similar to many cartoon movies. In each scene you only have to decide which direction of the keyboard has to be hit in order to avoid one of the countless death screens and to advance to the next screen...</desc>

		<desc>Space Crusade is a science fiction strategy game converted from the Games Workshop/Milton Bradley boardgame, in which you control a commander and four marines who are sent on different missions aboard hostile alien starships. Your commander starts off as a sergeant, but he can work his way through the ranks. The game allows three players, each commanding one marine chapter each. The alien team is `played` by the computer. 

The game is a literal conversion of the board game in the same vein as Gremlin's earlier Hero Quest. It can be best described as a turn-based board game in which the player must fulfill the primary and secondary objectives to complete the mission, which usually involves elimination of entire alien force on board or destruction of mothership etc. This game features unique 3D close-ups during the battle scenes, a feature which was later adopted by games like the X-Com series.</desc>

		<desc>2039 A.D. Man begins deep space exploration in search of new life forms and usable fuel sources. What he discovers is trouble.

Until now, the success of past explorations was causing the space effort to grow by leaps and bounds. Until now, the explorers had found little more than fungus and small insects as alternative
lifeforms. Until now, the chief dangers had been 
those posed by the hostile environment of space. Until now, the aliens had not known about THEM.

On the ragged edge of the galaxy, other creatures that roam the stars discover humans and spaceships to be excellent sources of food and other resources. Prepared at the worst for clashes with rival exploration teams, the human crews can do little to
defend themselves as wave upon wave of nightmare
creatures descend upon their ships and bases.

In response to their distress calls, the Federation has assembled a series of rescue teams, lead by their best military sharpshooters, to deal with the alien menace. As the leader of one of these teams, you must gun down the intruders and pick up the human survivors. Brave the maze of dark corridors that may lead to a deadly shootout between you and legions of monsters. Pick up survivors and extra ammo on the way.</desc>

		<desc>At times of high political tension, secret armies such as the SAS, Spetsnaz and Delta Force form the cutting edge in today's international conflicts.
These are the special forces that have won - and lost - the most spectacular military operations, in times of peace and war.
In Special Forces, the sequel to the award winning Airborne Ranger, you take charge of a specially trained team, equipped and organised to operate secretly behind enemy lines.
Enter zones of hostility in four different climatic regions, to sabotage, assassinate or rescue, and develop the close-quarter combat skills and personal survival techniques needed to complete your mission before the enemy even know you're there.
Under cover, outnumbered and alone.</desc>

		<desc>The game is based on Arthurian legend. Both fictional and historical sources are used to recreate the atmosphere of the age of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, and to draw out characters' names, history and relationships. The game's sources include medieval works such as Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, modern ones such as Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon, and a number of historical treatises on Arthur of the late 1980s. The game is set in the year 539, shortly after the Battle of Camlann at which King Arthur has been mortally wounded by the traitorous Mordred. Britain urgently needs a new king who can reunite its scattered realms and bring the Round Table back to its former glory. Arthur left a successor in the person of Lord Constantine the Crown Regent.</desc>

		<desc>Stardust is basically Asteroids, but with a lot of gameplay modifications. There are 30 standard levels split into 5 worlds. The 6 levels a world is made of can be completed in any order. However, you must fight an end-of-level bad guy once you have finished the 6th level of a world. While each level has the standard disintegrating rocks to destroy, all but 2 of them have extra bad guys, with a range of attack patterns.

There are a number of different weapons available, which are collected by moving your ship so that it crosses their paths as they float through space. Each of these can be powered up - some weapons start strong but can't be powered up as much as others; fortunately you can power up one weapon while using another. Extra lives, shield enhancements and a smart bomb are also on offer. 

Along with the standard levels, there are also 4 tunnel levels, which involve shooting what you can and dodging everything else as you dart through a ray-traced 3D tunnel, and 2 optional Thrust-style bonus levels in which lives can be won or lost.</desc>

There are a number of different weapons available, which are collected by moving your ship so that it crosses their paths as they float through space. Each of these can be powered up - some weapons start strong but can't be powered up as much as others; fortunately you can power up one weapon while using another. Extra lives, shield enhancements and a smart bomb are also on offer. 

Along with the standard levels, there are also 4 tunnel levels, which involve shooting what you can and dodging everything else as you dart through a ray-traced 3D tunnel, and 2 optional Thrust-style bonus levels in which lives can be won or lost.</desc>

		<desc>In the sequel to Super Ski, six ski events are available - Super Giant, Bobsleigh, Slalom, Ski Jump, Moguls, and Downhill. Set in famous resorts of French Alps  such as Val-d'Isère, Courchevel, or La Tania, ski events may be practiced in Training mode, or taken on in a sequence of 2 of each in Competition mode. 

Almost all events show the player from behind, except Moguls, where screen is scrolling down with players` progress, and Ski Jump, where player should come to camera from the far view. Player should avoid obstacles, stay on a route, and pass the gates in Slalom-like events; stay on the route in Bobsleigh, finish in first place with more style and jumps in Moguls, and jump good in Ski Jump.

1-2 players mode is available.</desc>

		<desc>The second of Lucasfilm Games' air combat simulations and follow-up to Battlehawks 1942, Their Finest Hour recreates the Battle of Britain during WWII in the summer of 1940.

Players can fly both for the German Luftwaffe and the British Royal Air Force.

On the British side, two planes are available: the Spitfire and the Hurricane. For the Germans, there is the fighter Bf 109, the heavy fighter/fighter bomber Bf 110, the infamous Ju 87 Stuka dive bomber, and the three light/medium bombers Do 17, He 111 and Ju 88.

Next to training missions for every plane, there are several historical combat missions to be flown. In accordance with history, most RAF missions consist of defense assignments - intercepting and destroying German bombers. Most Luftwaffe missions are attack runs - either flying the bomber escort or the bombers themselves. In the heavier planes, not only can the pilot of the plane be controlled, but also the gunner(s), and, in the bombers, the bombardier.

The special Campaign Mode allows one to actually change the historical outcome of the Battle of Britain. On a strategic map, planes must be organized into groups and assigned to missions, one of which must be flown. The outcome of that mission affects those of all others and also the status of the overall campaign. The British side wins by simply surviving for a certain time or by destroying enough German aircraft. The German side wins by destroying enough RAF fighters, either in the air or on the ground.

Also included in the game is a mission builder for designing custom missions, and a film playback option for reviewing recorded flight footage.</desc>

Many levels are horizontally scrolling, although with high ledges to jump onto and follow for a slightly different path. Magic urns containing improved weapons appear frequently. Most enemies are easy to attack and only need one hit to kill, although they come at you in large hordes. Once you get to the indoor sections you will find big enemies with the ability to kill you with one hit, in sections set on multiple levels complete with stairways.</desc>

		<desc>Top Banana is a game synthesised from everything that was hip, cool and "in" during the early nineties. With members from the experimental sampling music group Coldcut in the development team, it aimed to look no worse than a contemporary MTV video, with a cool rave intro, crazy "sampled" graphics composed of random imagery and lots of aaaciiiiiid.
What it all boils down to is a very simple platform game with very advanced graphics. You control a girl in a rave outfit who jumps through a series of platform worlds where you throw some love around in the form of hearts, which somehow ties into an environmentally conscious (the packaging was made out of recycled paper) theme where the enemies are representatives of big business. Also, similar to Rainbow Islands, a mass of water is slowly rising from below, so you must hurry upwards through the level.</desc>

		<desc>1829: The Esmerelda, a cargo ship carrying gold, sinks to the bottom of the ocean.

1927: A treasure hunter called Howard Kelp dons a diving suit and searches for the bullion in the wreck.

Treasure Trap is an isometric action adventure similar to Head Over Heels, but less abstract in its theme. The player guides the diver in a series of rooms (100 total) where the main goal is to collect gold. The main hazard encountered is the sea life that occupied the vacant ship. The character has no weapons, but carries a limited amount of "smart fishes", trained piranhas that attack and destroy all the enemies in the room. Since the player starts with 2 fishes and only receives a new one at each 80 gold bars collected, most of the time the enemies have to be avoided by staying away or jumping over them. Stacking boxes and other objects stops the fauna from getting to the character (and also allows access to high places). There's an air gauge that is constantly depleting at the bottom-right of the screen. It can be filled with the compressed air tanks scattered in some rooms. Some doors require geometric-shaped keys. These can be collected and stored in three slots at the bottom-left of the screen. The game allows saving at each 50 gold collected.</desc>

		<desc>After the Cariken family became complacent, the land of Gaspar ceased to be ruled as well. This left the way clear for evil men such as Maldur the druid to step in and slaughter the family, shattering their magical amulet. Only one of the family survived, and the amulet was broken into 23 pieces. 

As Ulopa, the sole survivor, you must reclaim the pieces. They are spread across 23 levels of platforming action, combining surface areas with some underground tunnels. You have 3 types of weapons with different functionality: switching between them at the right moments is vital. You can also collect upgrades from the carcasses of dead enemies. Other upgrades such as springs and a parachute can also be found.</desc>

		<desc>After the Cariken family became complacent, the land of Gaspar ceased to be ruled as well. This left the way clear for evil men such as Maldur the druid to step in and slaughter the family, shattering their magical amulet. Only one of the family survived, and the amulet was broken into 23 pieces. 

As Ulopa, the sole survivor, you must reclaim the pieces. They are spread across 23 levels of platforming action, combining surface areas with some underground tunnels. You have 3 types of weapons with different functionality: switching between them at the right moments is vital. You can also collect upgrades from the carcasses of dead enemies. Other upgrades such as springs and a parachute can also be found.</desc>

		<desc>Unlike the first two games in the series, which fell into the roleplaying and resource-management category, Universe 3 poses true logic-based puzzles for you to solve. Your characters move about in much the same way as their counterparts in Breach, Omnitrend's tactical combat RPG.

You set out to escort a diplomat on a trip to the hyperspace booster (a key element of Universe 2) to investigate the disappearance of shipments from Earth to this remote corner of the star map. The story takes a quick twist when you and your crew are captured, forcing you to rack up some criminal charges during your escape. You'll spend the rest of your time looking for evidence about the missing shipments, which will clear you of the charges as well as wrap up the mystery.</desc>

		<desc>Unreal is an action/adventure that is completely unrelated to the popular FPS from 1998 with the same name. Unreal is a magical world where you must save Princess Isolde, your true love, from the evil Polymorphic, the Master of Darkness.

Unreal is made up of 8 levels and contains a mixture of 2D and 3D graphics.  The environment is also completely interactive - you can run up and down hills and slide through the snow but you have to be careful to not fall of the top of a cliff.

On each level you will be faced with puzzles and battles and you need to get the high score you pass to the next level.  If your health reaches zero you will die and the game is over.  Fortunately, your health is replenished at the end of each level.</desc>

		<desc>This follow-on to Arthurian RPG adventure Spirit of Excalibur, Vengeance of Excalibur picks up where the old one ended. While power in Britain has been restored after the death of King Arthur and the destruction of evil sorceress Morgan Le Fay a terrible force has been unleashed. The demonic Shadowmaster, a dark summoning of the slain witch, is terrorizing Britain entrapping the King and stealing the fair court enchantress, Nineve. You must command the knights of the kingdom to find and destroy the vile beast.

The gameplay takes place in seven acts or episodes and features a mix of RPG, adventure, and simple strategy game (for combat) elements. The gameworld itself is rich and diverse (loosely based on medieval Spain) featuring dozens of towns, cities, and castles. Traveling from location to location takes place on an overhead map, while each actual location consists of picturesque hand-painted backdrops depicting the type of environment it is set in. The interface is entirely mouse-driven (although keyboard short-cuts are also present), iconic, and streamlined to make it accessible to inexperienced game players.</desc>

The main options screen allows you to select manual or automatic transmission, number of laps, and training, single race, or full season. The multiplayer option allows two players to race against each other on separate computers.

Each track, with different layouts and background graphics, includes many tight curves, steep grades and inclines, as well as tunnels and a pit stop.

The player-controlled car has working side-view mirrors, which allow you to view the actual action behind you, as well as a working speedometer and gear display.

The game features a colorful mix of 3D and 2D graphics, realistic sound effects, and blazing fast, smooth animations.</desc>

His surviving son Saul takes it upon himself to avenge his family. Using his father's research, he turns into a man-wolf and sets out to find CHIMERA's base and defeat their leader Karl Draxx.

As Saul, it is your job to traverse five different areas on your way to Draxx. When Saul collects enough power-ups, he turns into his wolf form and gains a special psychic shot attack, which can be improved by collecting futher power-ups. However, if Saul loses health, he turns back into his human form and only has his fists to fight the numerous enemies.</desc>

His surviving son Saul takes it upon himself to avenge his family. Using his father's research, he turns into a man-wolf and sets out to find CHIMERA's base and defeat their leader Karl Draxx.

As Saul, it is your job to traverse five different areas on your way to Draxx. When Saul collects enough power-ups, he turns into his wolf form and gains a special psychic shot attack, which can be improved by collecting futher power-ups. However, if Saul loses health, he turns back into his human form and only has his fists to fight the numerous enemies.</desc>

		<desc>At the height of the World Wrestling Federation's European fame came this crunching recreation of the elaborate hammed-up action. Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior or the British Bulldog can come under your control.

You play either in practice matches (against the hopefully-misnamed Mr Perfect) or in a sequence of 5 matches to win the Wrestlemania Belt. Your opponents have different special moves - watch out for The Warlord's Full Nelson and Sgt. Slaughter's Camel Clutch, for example. Before the fights start, your opponents will deliver a taunt, which you must respond to as creatively as possible.

The game is a beat 'em up viewed from a forced perspective above and behind the action. Your aim is to pin your opponent to the ground for 3 seconds, which can only be done once he has been weakened. Kicks, punches and throws will reduce an opponent's strength bar. When a strong opponent is down, stamping on him will pay off more than attempting a pin.

Avoid leaving the ring for too long - 20 seconds out and the match is void, which counts as a defeat. As in real WWF, the frame of the arena can be used to perform moves. Once players are in close contact, waggle the joystick to ensure you win the grapple.</desc>

Xenomorph is a first person RPG. Like the Dungeon Master series everything happens in real time. You move around in 10 foot steps and can turn 90 degrees. You have two hands to fight and use items with, a belt and holster for quick access to weapons as well as an inventory for carrying things.

		<desc>'Nam 1965-1975 is a strategy game set during the Vietnam war. The player takes the role of both the President of the United States and the commander-in-chief, and the goal of the game is to prevent the South of Vietnam to fall in the hands of the Vietcong, managing its military resources and preventing the public opinion to reject the war. As President, the player has to manage the military resources, and as Commander in chief they can take direct decisions on the terrain, such as tactics or engaging enemies. 

The game offers five different scenarios: Khe Sanh, Tet Offensive, 1975 offensive, Nixon and Johnson. The first three are some of the most decisive battles during the conflict, whereas choosing "Nixon" or "Johnson" changes the year (1964 or 1968) in which the player starts playing.</desc>

		<name>221B Baker Street</name>
		<desc>Based on the board game of the same name, 221 B Baker St. pits up to four players against each other in a race to solve mysteries set in Victorian London.  After picking a character (Sherlock Holmes, Dr. Watson, Irene Adler, or Inspector Lestrade), players select one of the thirty available mysteries and read its case file in the game's manual.  The case file presents the particulars of the case, mentions the people involved, and explains what the players need to deduce to win the game.

Solving the mysteries entails moving around London (the game board) via a roll of the dice, entering locales to collect clues, and then piecing the clues together.  Among the fifteen locations available are a pub, a park, and a bank, and each location is brought to life with voice synthesis.  Each location will have a clue, but not all clues will be useful.  

Before solving the case, players must visit Scotland Yard for a badge.  Players might also want to use a badge to lock a location with a useful clue, requiring other players to detour to the locksmith.  Once a player believes they have solved the case, they must return to Baker Street and answer a quiz.  If the player is incorrect, the other players can continue.</desc>

The pace, spin and angle of each shot can be set up precisely before playing it. Both 8-ball (pot your seven colors plus the black to win) and 9-ball (pot the 9-ball with a shot that also hits the lowest remaining ball, whatever that may be) are included. There are seven skill levels to work through. A trick-shot mode is also included, with 20 pre-set shots. Prior to each match it is possible to bet on the outcome.</desc>

		<desc>Claudette the cat has been kidnapped by scientists aiming to use her for experiments. Bob Cat can't allow this, and sets off to save her.

9 Lives is a platform game taking in four levels. The lengths of jumps are variable, depending on how long the joystick is pushed down for. Bonus items to be collected include rotor blades, to allow flight. 

Bob cannot kill his enemies, but can temporarily stun them, by hurling his ball of string at them. Contact with enemies or hazards causes an energy bar to decrease - a life is lost once it reaches zero. As the title suggests, this can happen eight times before a ninth death ends the game.</desc>

		<name>Action Fighter</name>
		<desc>This is a top down vertically scrolling shooter, in which you start off as a motorbike. You are quite vulnerable to attack at first, but power ups come in the form of a Sega van which you have to dock with. The first time you dock you get double fire, the second time gives you a rocket, the third gives a rear force field and the fourth invulnerablility.

By destroying cars and bikes that appear on your way, you can collect A-F letters. Collecting A through to D allows you change into a sportscar which is less vulnerable to attack, but not as nimble. Collect all the letters in order to be able to transform into a high tech plane. This is the final stage of one of the five missions. Only the high tech plane can guide you to your destination in which your main target is hiding.

There is also time limit in which you have to complete the mission. It is advisable to transform into the high tech plane as fast as it is possible.

Picking up flags gives you bonus points with 10,000 points gaining you an extra life.</desc>

The game takes place towards the end of the movie: the Addams Family has been evicted from their home by a court order issued by a backstabbing attorney (there's one for the books), Tully Alford. Even worse, the other Addamses: Morticia, Pugsley, Wednesday, Granny and Lurch have gone missing.

As Gomez, you must tour the Addams mansion in search of your lost family, battling out mysterious monsters and evading traps, and eventually face your nemesis, Tully.</desc>

		<name>ADS - Advanced Destroyer Simulator</name>
		<desc>Advanced Destroyer Simulator (ADS) is a naval combat simulation set in World War 2. It was the first naval simulation to use real-time filled 3D graphics. Its style and mechanics are reminiscent of Epyx's Destroyer (1986).

ADS simulates the H.M.S. Onslaught, a British destroyer of the O-class fitted with three cannon turrets, four torpedo tubes on port and starboard respectively, and a sonar to detect and track submarines. In ADS, the Onslaught is not part of a flotilla.

There's no campaign, gameplay is mission-based and set in three scenarios (two in the CPC version) with five mission each: The Mediterranean around Sicily, the English Channel between UK and France, and the North Sea coast of Norway. Objectives include seek-and-destroy assignments, patrols, convoy escorts, submarine hunts and blockade runs. Each scenario also offers an open “Delta” option where you cruise and hunt without specific objectives.

You navigate the destroyer manually, in real-time and from a first person perspective, though with the help of a scenario map. ADS simulates ship combat as a close-quarter exchange of torpedoes and cannon fire. In proximity to enemy land bases, Stuka fighters can attack and must be shot down with the cannons. Submarines are tracked with the sonar and can only be attacked once they surface. Enemy vessels include freighters, tankers, torpedo boats, destroyers and cruisers. Most missions are time critical; in the course of the mission, it may be necessary to dock in allied ports for repairs, to refuel and restock on ammunition.</desc>

		<desc>The game tries to represent the African part of 11th Paris-Dakar rally route, which in the game takes place in Tunisia, Algeria, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal in 1988-1989.

Controlling his(her) car in third-person 'behind the car' view, player should drive through the marked path in Sahara. When player loses his(her) way, he(she) may be in the sands alone and start to skid. In this situation he(she) may switch between 4x4 and 4x2 modes of the car. These modes have own opportunities and misses. The speed is limited to 87 in 4x4 mode and limited by car's parameters in 4x2 mode. But in 4x4 mode path marks may stop the car, while in 4x2 mode the car may knock the path parks off. Switching the gear, player may drive back and forth to avoid blocking of car either by path mark or by debris in the sand. Direction of the way is shown by compass as well as length of traversed path and volume of residuary fuel are displayed by indicators.

Other drivers are present on the way during day and night, therefore they should be left behind to win in the rally. There are five stages with different visible horizons:
1) Tunis - In Salah (5726 Km); 
2) Ouallene - Achegour (4353 Km); 
3) Achegour - Niamey (4587 Km); 
4) Ouagadougou - Bamako  (4438 Km); 
5) Bamako - Dakar (3622 Km).

So, you have to conquer the sands of Sahara, show good time on each stage, and to be the first at the finish.</desc>

These can be explored freely but sometimes you need to have special objects to proceed, e.g. a candle in dark rooms. The dangers consist mostly of sharp objects which can cause your ball to burst. Additionally you are on a timer because your balloon loses air constantly. But it can be refilled by using pumps which can be found in the maze - but you have to leave them in time or you explode because of overpressure.</desc>

		<name>Airborne Ranger</name>
		<desc>In this action/simulation game by Microprose the player takes the role of an U.S. Army airborne ranger. These Airborne rangers are dropped behind enemy lines by parachute to perform all kinds of dangerous missions. Gameplay consists of 3 phases:
Reading the mission briefing and outfitting 3 supply pods with machine gun ammo, time bombs, first-aid kits, grenades &amp; LAW rockets depending on this briefing.
2. Flying over the mission map in a V-22 Osprey plane to drop your 3 supply pods and parachuting out of the plane yourself.
3. Performing the actual missions and reaching the pick-up point before time runs out. There are 12 different missions which include capturing an enemy officer, blowing up an ammunition depot, photographing an experimental aircraft and liberating P.O.W.'s

Missions take place in either an arctic, desert or temperate setting. Using the mission map the player must decide the route towards the mission objective. This might require them to crawl through trenches, run around minefields or take out enemy soldiers and bunkers. Airborne Ranger was one of the first games with some missions that required a stealthy approach (staying undetected until a certain time, taking out a guard and stealing an enemy uniform etc.).

Airborne Ranger can be played in practice or veteran mode. In practice mode, gameplay is limited to a single mission, while in veteran mode, a series of missions or an entire campaign is played in order to earn medals &amp; promotions. All missions can be played on several difficulty levels.</desc>

		<name>Alien Storm</name>
		<desc>The aliens are invading Earth, and it's up to the "Alien Busters" to wipe them out and destroy their creator. The Busters consist of Karla, Gordon, and Scooter. Each one of them have their own weapons and special attacks.

When you start the game, you can select any one of these characters to play as. There are six missions to complete (eight in the Genesis version) with several stages, and each mission has you blasting aliens all the way to the end, from the streets to the mother ship where you'll meet the mother of all aliens. Unfortunately, blasting these aliens will not be an easy task, as they get tougher in every mission, and are capable of hiding into objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and several others. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people destroying an UFO.

When you deal with a few aliens, flying heads will appear, which you can shoot to collect life or energy (by the way, life is important to you, since if yours get empty, you're dead). However, rather than using your ordinary weapons, you can use the special attacks that are enough to kill aliens you currently see. These types of attack vary depending on the character you choose at the start of the game. For instance, Gordon summons a U.S. Air Force Jet that drop bombs across the street, while Scooter is able to teleport out of his present location, and leave a series of bombs that will blow up aliens on sight, he will then re-appear. However, using your character's special attack uses up a lot of energy, and if you have little or no energy, you can't use it.

At the end of some missions is an alien boss, which you must destroy in order to complete the mission. Also, at the end of every one, you have to enter buildings where you participate in a shooting gallery. The object is to kill aliens popping up from several locations with the building. 

You can play Alien Storm by yourself, or with another person.</desc>

		<name>Anarchy</name>
		<desc>As a Defender clone, Anarchy is a sidescrolling parallax shooter, in which you take on the evil Anarchists and their destructive behaviour. Your ship moves left or right on a looping level, shooting the enemies and finally the bosses. You have a single life with gradually draining energy. No less than 50 High Scores are recorded.

There are no surprises in gameplay, except the usual upgrades for your ship - X-shaped pods reveal circles, which can be collected to produce multiple fire beams, multi-directional shots, and drones with advanced cannons

The action is fast and smooth, and anybody looking for a straight shooter might take a glimpse, although the reviews from the magazines mostly ranged from bad to mid-class.

Anarchy was released under Psygnosis label Psyclapse. The manual comes in four languages: English, French, German and Italian.</desc>

And then, in the World Championship you can choose another option: see the stats of your competitors (his times in the trainings, records and position in start line), also you can run the official training on each circuit to be placed on the best position to start the race.

The game includes 16 circuits in total (the official of this competition), you can try it by separate to train, but if you want to win the title you must to show your abilities in each one of them since the first.

		<name>Annals Of Rome</name>
		<desc>Annals of Rome begins in 273BC and sets you as a Roman senator, with the ultimate aim of colonizing as much of the known world as possible, and retaining that power against Carthaginians, Vandals,  Parthians, Persians and all the other world forces. You have a strong army at your disposal, and can direct your generals as to which countries they attempt to invade.

The game is turn-based, and these turns operate in phases, beginning with the economic circumstances of population and tax income being decided - it's recommended to keep taxation taxing low unless things become desperate. The game then updates you on the statuses of your generals, and give you the chance to redistribute them to other parts of your kingdom. 

Officers may rebel and cause a civil war - fortunately this can usually be pre-empted. More serious are attempts to take land from other civilizations, which take place in order and include conflicts between other groups. These, like every element of the game, are accurately historically modeled and variable in time-span as a result.</desc>

		<name>Antago</name>
		<desc>Antago is a puzzle game played on a 5x5 square board. It can be played either against the computer, with a choice of up to 10 levels of difficulty, or against another human player. Other options allow you to play a match or start a training session, as well as select between "plain" (empty board) and "prepared" (pre-arranged balls on the board) game modes. A demo mode is also available, where the computer plays against itself.

An angel and a devil compete against each other, with the goal of aligning five "balls" in a row on the board, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. They are moved around the board with the joystick, pushing each other as their paths cross, and strategically placing balls on the edge of the board to both disrupt their opponent's lines and try to create a line of 5 of their own balls.

Each level features different background and board graphics. There is no background music playing during the game, and only basic sound effects when the two characters push each other, place a ball on the board and win.</desc>

		<desc>If you can defeat the dragon Fumo, your status as a magician will be ensured. Many have tried to rid the world of his evil, but none have been strong enough.

Gameplay scrolls sideways and is platform based, with a very cutesy and consolesque look, and 17 levels, each containing an extra hidden section. Each level has its own elemental setting, taking in the fires of Hell and the clouds and light of Heaven. The levels are full of boxes, which can be used as weapons by kicking them at enemies. 

As you go you can also collect money, which can be spent in shops to buy useful extras. Many collectibles and other items exist, such as leaves (which change the effects of gravity, allowing you to jump higher and stay hanging in the air for longer), extra lives, fruit for bonus points, and balloons allowing a degree of vertical movement.</desc>

		<name>Arkanoid</name>
		<desc>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.

The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.

By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.</desc>

Viewed from the side and scrolling horizontally, the game is in a similar vein to R-Type and Life Force / Salamander. Extra weapons are gained by shooting crystals and then collecting the resultant pod.  Weapons on offer including lasers firing vertically and outwardly, as well as faster weaponry recharging.</desc>

Then, you fly around in a helicopter and the oject is to bring down airplanes without being shot at by the airplanes themselves, submarines, and any other ground fire. Make sure you land on the pad near the end.

In part two, you start out in the jungle and must jump from rock to rock without crashing into toucans (shoot at them to make them fly higher) and being blown to bits. Then you have to make your way to the general's offices shooting soldiers on the way, and finally, locate the secret documents. When you complete the seven sections of Army Moves, you'll receive a higher bonus.

Some versions have a high score table to record your achievements. The second section must be loaded seperately, using a code attained from completing part one, on some versions.</desc>

Many squares featuring a variety of power-up type effects, such as improved weaponry, extra lives, a level warp, a device to stop the landscape's (otherwise constant) scrolling (thereby giving you a chance to 'pick off' the aliens more carefully), and one which speeds up the aliens (avoid this!). You can move backwards a short way, but it takes a few squares' worth of screen to get fully across the screen, so bear this in mind in the mazier sections.</desc>

Shooting the asteroids splits them into two smaller ones, until they are small enough to be destroyed. If you collide with an asteroid, you're dead, unless you activate your forcefield which will bounce the ship off the asteroids. Sometimes, a flying saucer flies through the screen, shooting everywhere. Additional asteroid shapes also show up, such as the blue target-seeking hexagons which split up into smaller triangular missiles.</desc>

		<name>Atomix</name>
		<desc>Atomix is a puzzle game. On each level, you are given a couple of atoms, and your task is to arrange them into a specific shapes. 

In a top-down view, you see all the atoms available for you to move, and all the directions they can connect to. Down below on the left side is a small picture of what you must get. That picture represents some molecular structure that you must complete by moving atoms horizontally and vertically. Once you move your atom, it won't stop unless it bumps into something, so you have to use other atoms as blockades to prevent it from going into unwanted areas. 

There are over 50 levels, and you have limited time for each level.</desc>

		<name>Austerlitz</name>
		<desc>Third entry in a row of historic wargames focussing on the Napoleonic era (the first two were Waterloo and Borodino). This time the player can re-fight the decisive battle of Austerlitz, which took place on Dec 2, 1805. You may either play as Emperor Napoleon or Czar Alexander. It is also possible to play a two player game, or to take neither side (watching the computer playing both sides).

Compared to the first two entries in the series the games' presentation and interface didn't change. You are observing the battle area through a 3-D perspective, while issuing commands by typing in certain pre-defined text elements (combined with names of commanders, places and time of execution). You will get reports from your subordinates indicating whether or not your orders have been carried out completly (this is of course besides watching the battlefield yourself).</desc>

		<name>Back to the Future Part II</name>
		<desc>Back to the Future II is a collection of five arcade and puzzle games.

Based on the second installment of the popular Hollywood series Back to the Future, this movie conversion has Marty McFly and Doc Brown travel through time to stop their arch-rival Biff from changing the future. The game consists of five parts, each inspired by one of the movie's most memorable scenes:

1. Hoverboard Chase: A Paperboy clone without newspapers, but with isometric levels and lots of enemies to dodge.
2. Jennifer Rescue: Guide Marty's girlfriend Jennifer out of the house without her meeting one of the four family members. Open and close doors to make the persons go from one room to the next in this top-down puzzle sequence.
3. Beat Biff: A side-scrolling beat-em-up sequence in the tradition of Double Dragon. Fight your way through a grim 1985 by jumping, hitting and kicking at Biff's lackeys.
4. Band Puzzle: Rearrange the mixed-up parts of an animated picture of the school band in this sliding block puzzle. The clock is ticking.
5. Hoverboard Chase 2: Another hoverboard sequence, similar to the first one, only this time set in 1955.</desc>

		<name>Back to the Future Part III</name>
		<desc>Back to the Future III is a collection of four arcade games. Marty McFly and Doc Brown have traveled back through time to the year 1885 - and they're soon deep in trouble when they face "Mad Dog" Tannen's gang and have to find a way to return to the present. This game takes four scenes from the Hollywood movie Back to the Future III and turns them into arcade sequences:

1. Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save Hill Valley's lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective.

2. Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets.

3. Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It's an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back.

4. The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and collect speed logs to push the engine to a magic 88 mph.</desc>

Armadas of hostile UFOs shoot fire balls at you from every direction. Your aiming reticle is in the centre of the display, and is surrounded by circular radar, which is formed by a series of small white dots, within this are numerous red dots which represent the UFO enemies. You are dealt an initial five lives, and you score points for each UFO destroyed. The game features environmental effects, such as day time turning to night, and vice versa.</desc>

		<desc>The plot of "Bad Company" is quickly told: Earth is dying and mankind needs new worlds to colonize, the Nu-Worlds. You and your (optional) companion have the task to clear those worlds from hostile alien insectoids.

"Bad Company" is played in a pseudo-3D view (third person) that very much resembles that of Space Harrier games.
Before you start to play you'll have to choose one of the eight offered troopers as your player character. This decision will influence gameplay later on, e.g. you won't be able to carry a specific weapon or your character is especially fast, and so on. When it comes to the action you'll be confronted with several different alien types including "level bosses".You battle these foes by using one of the four available weapon systems (equipment can be changed in the course of the game). You have full movement control over your character, meaning the screen isn't auto-scrolling like in comparable games. You can also take cover behind certain obstacles or choose to blow them up.

The game extends over four levels (the four Nu-Worlds).</desc>

Two human players can take part, but only the winner continues without using up credits, so you will only see the early races in two-player mode. 

You are armed with guns, which can be used to slow opposing cars. During the races spanners can be collected, which are then cashed in for upgraded turbos, improved weaponry and engine upgrades. Hazards on the later tracks include ramps, bridges, buildings collapsing onto the track and barriers which open and close in a random sequence.</desc>

		<name>Balance of Power</name>
		<desc>The year is 1986. You take on the role of the US President or the Russian General Secretary. You have the full industrial capacity, covert forces, and military might of your country at your command. Your job? To make your country the world's most powerful and prestigious over the course of your 8 years in office. Sounds easy, doesn't it? It would be if the other guy didn't have his finger poised over a red button that could wipe out the world! 

You must use diplomacy, make treaties, issue risky, covert CIA or KGB actions, or riskier, direct military intervention to prop up 3rd world countries or help their insurgents and win them to your governmental philosophy: Capitalism or Communism. The world is a big place... and the other guy could start a nuclear war over a country as tiny as Tunisia. This game is the ultimate Cold War simulation. Every action requires careful analysis and the ability to judge your opponent (computer or human) and his reaction.

The game features 62 countries, each carefully researched with up to date (as of 1985) information regarding their government, demographics, resources, etc.  This game is very challenging, and will keep you up for hours. Be sure to try playing against a human too... it adds a whole new dimension.</desc>

To do this, you will control an arrow that defines a direction, and pressing the fire key will launch a ball from this arrow in the direction the arrow points to; by launching balls at correct angles, you will manipulate the main ball and control the way it moves. Ballistix also keeps certain physics laws (namely gravity and friction), and will present you with varying obstacles in either one or two player mode.</desc>

You have full control over the bat, able to move up and down as well as left and right. The latter can be useful as only part of the bottom of the screen actually results in the ball going out of play - a wall protects much of the floor. There are inbuilt trees which can't be played through, and dynamite sticks which can clear large sections of earthing at a time.</desc>

		<desc>In this game you play the role of a barbarian who must navigate his way through dangerous dungeons. The game is played from a third person side scrolling perspective and also has platform jumping parts to it. The barbarian is controlled by using left and right on the joystick to move and up and down is used to scroll through the various commands at the bottom of the screen.
When a command is highlighted pressing fire will perform that action thus saving on extra buttons being needed to play. There are two weapons at your disposal. A sword which you start the game with and later a bow which is handy for long range attacks. There are many traps to avoid and various monsters who have different attack patterns.</desc>

		<desc>Tales of the Unknown: Volume I, better known by its subtitle The Bard's Tale, is a fantasy role-playing video game created by Interplay Productions in 1985 and distributed by Electronic Arts. It was designed and programmed by Michael Cranford.

Based loosely on traditional Dungeons &amp; Dragons gameplay and inspired by the Wizardry computer games, The Bard's Tale was noteworthy for its unprecedented 3D graphics and partly animated character portraits. The Bard was also an innovation: The Bard was author Michael Cranford's contribution to the genre, a character who casts spells by singing one of six tunes.</desc>

Part three, "Bat"-cave: A puzzle game where you have to find a certain item (belonging to Joker) amongst other items. Part four, "Batjet": Cut the ropes of the balloons which are filled with poisonous gas. Part five, the cathedral: Hunt down Joker. This part plays like the first one.

There is a different animation for each permutation, depending on which pieces are capturing or being captured. You can also play in 2D without animation. 

The game's opening library includes 30,000 different moves, ensuring a variety of games will unfold across the 10 skill levels.

The player decides which race they want to play (Human, Orc, Dwarf or Elf) each with their own strengths and weaknesses. It is then a matter of clearing out areas of opponents and finding items to enhance your character's and companions abilities. 

There are many traps to avoid and death is a constant in what most people would find a very tough game. 

The nearest game to compare it to would be Rage Of Mages, though that has more of an RPG focus, it does bear aesthetic similarities and a squad based fantasy fighting theme.</desc>

Earth has been invaded, and you and your tank lead the defensive effort. You drive around the battlefield from a first-person view, targeting and firing at tanks, planes and UFOs. You have a radar to help you see where the enemies are in direction and distance. Objects can be used as strategic cover. Controls simulate the tracks of a tank realistically, so the direction and speed settings are varied - combining forward right and backward left movements (as you can on keyboard versions) sees you change direction more quickly.</desc>

		<desc>What can you add to Battleship over the pencil and paper version? A computerized opponent, fairly obviously, as well as the chance to play without using up the earth’s limited paper and pen resources.  The possibility of cheating is removed as well.

Elite go beyond this by changing the shapes of the ships to be more Tetris style, and allowing these to be placed at each of the 4 main angles. A ‘Salvo Fire’ mode sees each player fire a succession of shots (each of your six ships gets four shots a turn until it’s sunk), meaning that strategic play involves firing on a wide range initially in the hope of finding a ship, before homing in on the area in the next turn. Finally, there’s an animated sequence for each go, which is depicted as an air strike. As well as standard two-player games, there’s also a multi-player mode in which the winner’s score accumulates until he loses, allowing for a “winner stays on” structure if there are 3 or more of you.</desc>

Other levels feature Asteroids which split when shot, or a single ‘boss’ alien. Aliens with green eyeballs release power-ups, such as improved weapons, shields and bombs. You have a single life with which to survive the carnage. You get points for surviving as well as scoring, so slow but cautious play is more rewarding.</desc>

The ultimate goal is to bring all the colored lamps back to the case, including the elusive Black Lamp.

The Black Lamp world is presented as a collection of rooms, all connected with ladders and/or doors, as well as outside areas where you must defend yourself by shooting or avoiding the attacking creatures.

That means to say that the main gameplay consists of flying through single-screen wrap-around levels shooting at rocks, which split into smaller rocks when hit, eventually becoming small enough to disappear. 

In this case the Asteroids are protecting Mukor, an evil being who is poisoning planets under the Colonising Corp’s control.
Each level is split into either 9 or 16 sub-levels, which are chosen through a square in which any remaining level which is adjacent to the last level completed can be selected. There are 3 different ships (Speeder, Fighter and Warrior), which can be switched between at any time. Power-ups (including improved weapons, shield recharges and a faster thrust) can be collected by flying into them.</desc>

Gameplay follows the usual pattern for Ikari Warriors-style games - kill off the bazooka-toting baddies, which emerge from hiding places or enter the screen in waves. You can do this by either shooting them or running them over with your tank. Parts of the scenery often block your path and need destroying. Once you clear the level you are confronted by a boss, which in the first level is an enormous tank which you have to disable the guns of.</desc>

The levels themselves are flick-screen and are layered with platforms. Making the task difficult are spiders, mice and the like - watch out in particular for the jumping frogs.

		<name>Bobo</name>
		<desc>The game Bobo is an cartoon style arcade game.
The main character is Bobo - controlled by you - he is an inmate and has been sentenced for 17 years.
In this game inmate Bobo must do many chores, such as peeling potatoes, ladling soup to his fellow prisoners, helping his fellow prisoners to escape, jumping electric wires and singing lullabies to his snoring cell mates.

Besides playing all events it is possible to select and play just one event.
Up to six player can play this game by entering their names. They play alternating not simultaneously

Each event can be played by joystick or keyboard. The specific moves you have to make vary from event to event but it come basically down to moving the joystick or keyboard keys fast from left to right. To pick things up you have to move the joystick downwards (keyboard arrow key down). Tossing things is done by moving the joystick up (when using the keyboard you have to press cursor key up).

Below you 'll find a brief description of each event:

Bobo has a job in the prisons canteen. He must serve soup to the other inmates and keep their soup plates full. To do this Bobo must move around the tables. When his supply of soup is empty he must refill it at the top of the screen where a new supply of soup is available. If his fellow inmates demand more soup they  start banging and hammering on the tables. The score of this event is based on how many plates of soup he hands out.

Peeling potatoes is not Bobo's favorite chore but he has to do it. He has to pick up a potato, then peeling it and when that's done tossing it away. Bobo scores points based on the number of potatoes he has peeled. If a potato is not fully peeled it will be tossed back.

In the next event Bobo must help his inmates to escape prison. The inmates are jumping out of their cell windows and it is Bobo's task to get them over the prison wall by moving a trampoline around. 
The score is based on how many inmates actually can escape. Bobo must be sure to catch the inmates under the right angle with his trampoline because if he fails the inmates will crash into the prison wall.

Finally, Bobo found an way to escape prison. He must jump from wire to wire and as the wires are electrified he must take care not to be electrocuted. The score in this event based on how long Bobo can prevent being electrocuted. Bonus points can be earned by picking up the green objects that appear occasionally on the wires

In the last event Bobo has been captured by the poli</desc>

In each round, collecting a number of bombs results in a bonus coin appearing, and collecting this coin will make the player's score increase 2 to 4 times. More often than not, the "power ball" appears, and when you collect this, you can defeat enemies and have more time to collect all the bombs. There is also the "E" coin, which gives Jack one additional life, but rarely does this coin appear.

The more you progress through the game, the more difficult it becomes, as enemies travel more quickly to get you.</desc>

Bigger ones have such a huge blast radius that Bombuzal cannot trigger them directly - instead, he has to explode smaller bombs first and cause a chain reaction. So as one might imagine, later levels turn into loud blastfests that need to be carefully planned.

Besides, later levels introduce all kinds of additional hazards and gimmicks, like ice floors, movable bombs, disappearing ground tiles, and much more. Nobody said being a pyromaniac is easy.</desc>

		<name>Bonanza Bros</name>
		<desc>Mobo and Robo Bonanza are enjoying their favorite television show when the picture crackles and a shadowy figure of a mysterious stranger appears on screen. This figure asks them to collect certain items that he has placed inside various buildings to test his security force. If they return the items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be rewarded. The two of them state that they will get the job done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that each building is packed with security guards who will raise the alarm if they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended.

As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without  one of the three spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.</desc>

		<desc>Booly is a puzzle game with a similar concept to Gem’X in some ways. You are presented with a top-down view of an array of inter-connected blocks, which are shown in a variety of colours. The aim is to turn them all to grey, but clicking on them (using the pointer you are in control of) will often cause a pattern of other squares to change to the next colour in the sequence as well. You are doing all this with a time limit for each of the 300 levels. A level designer allows you to create your own sequence of up to 1000 levels.</desc>

Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.</desc>

Avoid hitting the fences, walls trees etc.., as they flip your buggy over and slow you down. You are competing against the clock so don't waste time, push the pedal flat to the floor. Try jumping obstacles by hitting the logs that lie across the track.

A burger is done when all four parts are on the lowest level. The platforms are interconnected with ladders which are also the only way to evade the enemies which walk around the levels (the player character can't jump).

		<name>Butcher Hill</name>
		<desc>Intelligence reports suggest that POWs have been captured and are being held hostage at the guerilla outpost on Butcher Hill. The game is divided into three sections. 

In the first section, players steer their dinghy along a river while avoiding mines and other obstacles. If the dinghy comes into contact with any mine, it explodes. However, when the player has collected ammo, the mines can be destroyed. Coming into contact with rocks causes the dinghy to bounce out of the water for a short distance. When a jetty appears, pressing the fire button allows the player to land and start the next section.

The second section has the player finding their way through dense jungle whose path lead to the enemy camp at the base of Butcher Hill. Stopping you from proceeding are soldiers that have orders to shoot you on sight. Mines are also scattered around the jungle floor and must be avoided. If players were able to obtain a compass in the first section, their current direction will be displayed at the right of the control panel. Shooting all the soldiers in the jungle gives the player extra ammunition and stamina.  

In the final section, players need to destroy the enemy camp by blowing up huts with bullets or grenades. While they are doing that, they must also be on the lookout for any soldiers that tries to leave the camp to bring back more soldiers.</desc>

		<name>Cabal</name>
		<desc>Cabal is a coin-op conversion of Capcom's arcade game. The mechanics of the game are simple: shoot everything in sight!

The hero (there is a two player mode) runs back and forth along the bottom of the screen, ducking and dodging bullets and grenades from the enemy. The roll maneuver from the arcade was not implemented in the PC version. You return fire by moving a target around the screen which also moves your character, so be careful not to run into a bullet.

The enemies throughout the 5 levels, come thick and fast and there are loads of them, normal foot soldiers, tanks, helicopters and end of level bosses, like submarines and war machines.

Just about everything on the screen can be blown up or shot. There are bonus points to be picked up for destroying buildings and weapons to be picked up from the enemy, such as machine- and shot-guns.</desc>

Legend has it that it’s filled with treasure. What the legend didn’t say is that the Castle is also filled with deadly traps, riddles and monsters. Surviving is not only a question of defending your life.  Karadoc also has to prove his wit in collecting objects, putting them to the right use, mastering spells and solving tasks posed by the gods. Quick reflexes and jumping skill wouldn’t hurt either.</desc>

The game starts in 200 B.C. and you can take control of one of the following states: Bosphorus, Carthage, Macedonia, Persia, Rome or Venetia. The aim of the game is to annihilate the other palyers. But it is not as easy as just to wage war on your enemies, you have to manage your economy, buy and sell food, recruit soldiers for your armies and build ships. 

When it's the players turn he/she have three moves; these move can be spent on attacking other provinces, raising armies, building ships or negotiate with other empires. Each turn represents a season, so there is four turns per year. Certain actions are only available in certain seasons, you can for example only fortify a province in the summer. At the end of each round a summary is given; the status of every player is given in a global index, considering countries, capitals, ships, troops, population, gold and corn. The player with the highest
index, shown graphically and in figures, is winning. The index also decides the order of play. To win the game 180 index points, or more than 7 capitals are needed.</desc>

Players can select sponsors (absent in some versions) and compete in events such as skateboarding, footbag, surfing, roller skating, flying disc (frisbee) and BMX.  The surfing event is ranked by judges, which give a score to help the players improve their routine.

The Atari versions (2600 and Lynx) of the game omit the flying disc and roller skating events, while the Genesis version omits only the flying disc event.</desc>

		<desc>Insane genius Austen van Flyswatter has stolen a huge collection of diamonds, and retrieving them involves navigating a succession of fiendishly-designed arrangements of platforms and traps. Does that sound like a job for a retired superhero? Captain Dynamo thinks so, and aims to recapture them for their rightful owner.

Gameplay is platform-based, with 12 vertically-scrolling levels, each containing around 50 diamonds - the more of these you can collect, the higher your score. Some will require advance planning to reach, while you will often be dependent on booster pads to reach the higher sections of a level.</desc>

The people can only be saved if a hero or two step forward and reach each of the 20 lifts in this Gauntlet-style game. Two players is the ideal, as gameplay is simultaneous and only ever fills half the screen for each player. Each level has doors which are locked with colour coded keys, as well as doors which can only be used in one direction, and lots of long corridors and mazy layouts. Both yourself and the aliens are armed with lethal lazers, although you can take several hits before dying.</desc>

With the help of the droids you explore tech-dungeons (its a SF-setting, but the feeling is like fantasy rpgs with robots and droids) and seek information, which lead to the next planet(s) on a path, which end marks your cell.
The Movement and Fighting is similar to games like Eye of the Beholder, but you can buy weapons and droid-parts in shops. The droids haven't levels like in normal rpgs, you must buy upgrades for the different parts of the droids, which make them stronger and faster. You can also buy a variety of chips, which allow the droids to see in darkness, invert the gravity or simple to shield a little period of time.</desc>

		<name>Carrier Command</name>
		<desc>Carrier Command was one of the first real-time strategy games.

You control an advanced cybernetic aircraft carrier complete with fighters, amphibious assault vehicles, laser defenses and a fleet of decoy drones.  Your mission is to build a series of resource, factory, and defensive bases spanning an island chain.  The only problem?  At the other end of the chain is an even more advanced carrier under control of a terrorist organization with the same mission.

As you move around the islands you must decide what facilities to build and where they will best support your advance.  Resource islands provide materials that factory islands can use to build weapons and vehicles to replace your combat losses but both will be quickly overrun if the enemy attacks them while you are not present.  You also have to ensure that your stockpiles of equipment are stored safely until you can find time to launch a resupply drone to bring them to your carrier.

From your carrier, you can take first person control of your attack aircraft and amphibious tanks and use them to assault enemy islands or even the enemy carrier itself if you're lucky enough to find it.  The weapon payloads on your vehicles are completely configurable based on your needs.  An island invasion may require launching a virus bomb that will take over the enemy command systems or just blasting the base with a wire guided surface to surface missile.

Ultimately, you have to find and destroy the enemy carrier but, doing so will require a solid supply infrastructure and a strategy for depriving your opponent of his.</desc>

You're at the controls of a car across a landscape made up of colourless girders, and your task is to drive over each of these in turn, which colours them in. By default, upon reaching the end of each platform you turn around, but you can jump across the gap by pressing fire. There are enemies to avoid contact with; these follow pre-programmed movement paths.</desc>

Gameplay combines action and puzzle-solving, across four primary towers with three levels each. Doors must be opened using one of the ten included keys. These are unmarked, as are the various potions - making it a challenge to know which keys open which doors, and which potions are beneficial. 

Contact with ghouls drains your energy, as does falling too far (there are narrow pathways to negotiate), while eating cheese can replenish this. Movement and aiming are controlled separately.</desc>

		<name>Toyota Celica GT Rally</name>
		<desc>A detailed recreation of rallying licensed from Toyota Great Britain. Driving on gravel, asphalt and ice is involved, with each race made up of a series of short stages to complete. After each stage, your times are compared with those of your rivals, whose names are subtly changed from the real drivers of the day. Up to four human players can be involved, taking it in turns.

As visibility is sometimes low, and the exact curvature of a corner isn't always obvious from the apex, a co-driver is provided to give pace notes. These can be adjusted before you take to the track, specifying what is defined as 'hard left' and how early the warning should be given.

The steering sensitivity can be adjusted, and you can choose between automatic centering, and a push-the-opposite-way-to-centre mode, but more unusual is the option to race with the steering directions reversed - definitely one for advanced players.</desc>

		<name>Championship Run</name>
		<desc>This racing game has a similar structure to Continental Circus, as in the first race you must finish no worse than 76th out of the 100 computer cars, but in each successive race, you must do more to qualify, although there are still 100 cars. You must be careful not to run off track, or into the other cars, as this causes the car to slow.
Your car has 3 gears, and you push fire while accelerating to go up a gear, and push it while braking to go down (which makes it harder to recover speed after an incident). The circuits are full of hairpins, traffic (not all of it in direct contest with you for position) and hills - rising over those can be precarious. The races are over 4 laps, and each lap's timing is displayed on screen, along with the distance left to complete this lap.</desc>

The player needs to guide Agar through different levels to save her. Each level however has completely different gameplay. The first one is set inside a castle with a first-person perspective where Agar needs to defend it against invading creatures by shooting them, similar to Operation Wolf. The second level is a Breakout variant. The third one a vertically-scrolling top-down shooter and the fourth one returns to the Breakout-like gameplay. The fifth one has typical platform gameplay, the sixth one returns to the mechanics of the first level and finally the seventh one is an Asteroids clone.</desc>

		<name>Chase HQ</name>
		<desc>As an undercover agent of Chase Headquarters, your job is to patrol the streets and track down five criminals. You are given a mission briefing before you start which gives information on the suspect and what car they drive. Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again. 

However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each arrest is based on a "suspicion".</desc>

		<name>Chess Player 2150</name>
		<desc>Chess Player 2150 is a chess program which played well against the other chess programs of the day and won the 1989 British Open Personal Computer Chess Championship (according to a post in ST Report International Online Magazine, November 13, 1992, No.8.45).  The author was not shy about his program's prowess.  Built into the program is a pull-down menu, giving it's performance against Chessmaster 2000, Chessmaster 2100 and Colossus X, in 10 games apiece.

The game was designed to improve as it played, so over time a game that played against good players would be much better than when it first began.  Users have the option of saving, so that the gained intelligence isn't lost.

Although the author clearly wanted the game to be used by serious chess players, he included whimsical chess pieces as well.  One set includes farm animals (sheep pawns, dog rooks, horse knights, chicken bishops, cow queens, and pig kings); Another setting includes Science-Fiction pieces that look like aliens. The game can be played in 2D or 3D, and includes digitised speech on the Amiga version.</desc>

Graphical features include a number of different pieces and the option to change the angle and zoom of the 3D playfield. Of course it is also possible to use a top-down perspective. The game also provides a way to calculate the user's ELO score: the program presents 24 situations and the player must provide likely moves within two minutes.</desc>

		<desc>Chinese Karate is a one vs. one fighter. Like the title suggests, the fights are restricted to hand-to-hand combat as well as flying kicks. The game consists of a tournament with six fights in which the player, in the role of the combatant with the white robe, battles against an opponent dressed in red.

The goal of each fight is to bring the opponent's health bar to zero before the own health runs out. If no fighter manages to KO the enemy after two rounds of 99 seconds, the guy with the most remaining health wins. Each fight takes place in another area with a new background image and progresses in difficulty. Between fights the player gets to engage in a bonus game in which items, e.g. flying balls or vases, have to be destroyed for bonus points.</desc>

		<desc>This racing game has novelty value if nothing else - instead of the more conventional vehicles, it sets you riding a sidecar in a game with realistic and arcade elements. The circuits are based on real ones, although the opposition (of which there are 9) are known simply by first names such as David and Paul.

The display appears to use real 3D, with some fairly terrifying directional changes, although it doesn't tilt as you turn. A full map of your position relative to your rivals is presented at the top of the screen. Crashes cause gradual engine damage, reducing your initial 140mph top speed by a slight amount each time - you'll also lose time as you rejoin. Before each race you must set a qualifying lap, which allows you multiple attempts.</desc>

		<name>Conflict Europe</name>
		<desc>At long last, the threat of nuclear nightmare diplomacy seems to be receding. The balance of terror that has entrapped humanity is loosening its grip. In CONFLICT: EUROPE we examine the "what if" scenarios that have dominated world affairs for the lost forty years.
Taking the player through seven different conflict situations, the simulation examines the shifting balance that exists between nuclear and conventional forces, between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. Allowing for full examination of the consequences of European conflict, CONFLICT: EUROPE shows why the nightmare must never become reality.
FEATURES:
- SIMULATION OF POSSIBLE WAR IN EUROPE NOW OR IN FUTURE
- SEVERAL DIFFERENT SCENARIOS ALLOW FOR DIFFERENT DISARMAMENT TREATIES
- GROUND, AIR ANO NAVAL FORCES INCLUDED
- FULL RANGE OF NUCLEAR AND CHEMICAL FIRE PLANS
- SPECIAL FORCES RAIDS
- AWACS AND SATELLITE RECONNAISSANCE
- COMPLEX FSM BASED STRATEGY SYSTEM</desc>

		<name>Conqueror</name>
		<desc>Conqueror is a polygonal isometric-view tank action/strategy game with an elaborate control system (emulating "real" tank controls on normal joysticks) and two-player possibilities by switching the controls to use one joystick each for gunner and driver.
The goal of the game is generally to destroy all enemy tanks on the map using a preset squad of tanks of your own. The tanks on the player's side that aren't controlled by the player act on AI, but the player-controlled tank can be switched at will via an in-game map. Alternately, the player can use that map to direct tanks to other places - but even when planning troop movements on the map, the game goes on.
To top things off, there is also a limited amount of resources allocated to the player and can be gained by destroying enemies; these resources can then be used to buy new tanks before the start of the next mission..</desc>

		<desc>The home conversions of Continental Circus lack the full-on 3D and special glasses of the arcade version, but retain the essential gameplay structure. The first race is in Brazil and features 100 cars, and requires you to finish in the top 80 in order to qualify for  next race. As you work through the 8 races the size of the field steadily decreases, but so does the worst acceptable finishing position to qualify.

The car has high and low gears, and is susceptible to damage from contact with another car. Once you hit a car or a piece of the trackside scenery you will be called into the pits - fail to make it back, or hit another car, and you will crash and lose several seconds.</desc>

		<desc>As a professional ornithologist, you're thrilled to find out that some rare South American hornbills have nested in your "old yolk tree." But while the hornbills are out feeding, a group of mischievous bluebirds, owls, and snakes begin raiding their nests and stealing eggs.

You get out your slingshot and begin hitting the marauding creatures. But you have to be careful. If you hit an egg-carrying bird, it drops the egg and you have to act fast to catch it before it hits the ground and return it to a nest. At the same time, you have to watch for snakes that may be sneaking up to nests and gobbling eggs. If you can protect the eggs long enough, you can take them to another nesting site.</desc>

		<name>Crash Garrett</name>
		<desc>Crash Garrett is an adventure in the mold of the classic 1930s film serials: you take on the role of dashing Crash Garrett, a flying ace who makes a living by flying rich Hollywood types around on private flights across the west coast of the United States. As the game opens, Garrett is taking journalist Cynthia Sleeze to an exclusive interview with a high-powered psychoanalyst to the stars, as part of a red-hot story. He soon becomes entangled in the story himself, and must use his wits, cunning and fists to save the day.

While the game takes typed commands, the action is shown as a sort of animated comic book. There is a background image that sets the scene (it may be a mini-map, that shows Garrett's current location marked with a red X) and on top of this are comic book panel-like portraits of the characters currently in the scene, that move around the screen and speak in speech bubbles. Some versions of the game use synthesized speech, but only when Garrett addresses the player, for "What do you want to do now?"-type prompts.</desc>

You don't control the town yet? This won't last long!
Maybe becoming mayor of the city would solve your problem.
But what about using mobsters to bribe, blackmail and fight the big guys.
Don't listen to justice and order, have no scruples, lead your Chinese or Italian gangs to gain control over money and power.
Who are you? The godfather, the “femme fatale", or the killer?
The action scenes will put you against punks, cops and Miers of the adversary gangs. That's right, cops are not necessarily on your side.
Make sure that you have your 45 automatic loaded.</desc>

The levels are pretty different: in England, you need to control a knight on his horse. You need to jump over all hurdles and collect all 80 shields to complete the level. In Scandinavia, you control a Viking on his boat. Here you need to collect treasure chests and avoid the whales crossing your way. In Russia, you play a Russian bear who needs to imitate the dance of a girl next to him. If he succeeds, the bystanders will give him money. In Japan, you control a small dragon which needs to jump from island to island. On his way, he needs to collect 80% of the stuff floating around or he will starve to death. In India, the small Indian boy needs to walk over the bridge, avoiding the flying bananas (?) and catch 8 mice. And finally, in Arabia, you control a dude on a flying carpet who needs to catch at least 50% of the flying lamps to stay on his carpet.</desc>

		<name>Cyberball</name>
		<desc>After American Football players started cheating by using bionic parts, the game was forced to change its rules. By 2022, the game was played not by humans, but two teams of seven robots. To spice things up, the usual pig skin ball was replaced with a 350 pound bomb.

Cyberball brings this fast and furious action to life. Gameplay is essentially the same as the real sport, although the 'downs' are replaced by the bomb's heat gradually increasing towards 'critical'. After this it will explode and possession will be swapped. This is prevented when you cross the 50-yard line, lose possession or score a touchdown, in which cases it resets to 'cool'. Field goals and punts are not featured - the only kick is the initial kick-off you receive.

Control passes from the quarterback (thrower) to the intended catcher as soon as a pass is released. The two-player game is co-operative - on offense one player passes and the other receives</desc>

Getting into the system is made easier by the presence of a secret entrance the computer doesn't know about. The computer has all manner of defences in place, which you can shoot out.</desc>

		<path>./Darius + (1989)(The Edge)[cr MCA].zip</path>
		<name>Darius +</name>
		<desc>Darius was Taito's effort to compete in the arcades against the likes of R-Type and Gradius. Technically impressive, it featured three screens depicting the largest playfield seen in a game so far (the same system was employed for Ninja Warriors), with the player sitting atop a big set of loudspeakers. Visually and audibly, it was a league above Irem's and Konami's offerings.

When Taito (and others) ported the game to home machines, they were forced to shrink the playfield to fit in one single screen, and re-dubbed it Darius Plus.

The plot of Darius involves the two heroes Proco Jr. and Tiat Young fighting the menaces posed by galactic fish and other sea animals again their homeworld.

What sets Darius apart from other shoot'em-ups of the time is its way of letting the player choose his path with a certain amount of freedom. At the end of each area (level), you are able to choose between one of two worlds which the area branches into. This renders a higher replay value, since there are many paths to reach the end of the game by.
Apart from this, the gameplay is on the simplistic side, both due to unimaginative attack waves and little interaction with the surroundings, but mainly due to the very basic powerup system, which is nowhere near the complexity of the aforementioned R-Type's and Gradius'.</desc>

The bulk of the game is side-viewed, involving single screens to pass through, which incorporate ropes, cages and trapdoor. There are enemies walking, flying and hovering through this, and many of them respawn. Unusually your weapon to take them on (rocks) can be thrown through 360 degrees, which aims to make the gameplay more realistic and methodical. The screens were linked by hub screens, which the player passes through simply by clicking on a door.</desc>

		<name>Dark Side</name>
		<desc>In Driller, the Ketars attempted to blow up the moon Mitral, but you stopped them. Now, they have Energy Collection Devices collectively known as EGOs, and hope to stock them up to use towards the Zephyr One device, and direct its energy at the planet Evath, resulting in a catastrophic radiation overload. 

Your mission is to beam onto their base on the moon Tricuspid, and destroy the EGOs. Destroying one will buy you more of your limited time. The problem is, many are connected to at least 2 others, and those can immediately regenerate, so you must tackle them in an order in which those with only 1 connection are attacked first.

You are inside a space suit, propelled by a Jet Pack with limited fuel, and possess lasers and a shield. Shield energy is limited, but can be recharged through pentagons and rods. In a world viewed through the the Freescape 3D system, you roam the verdant planet of trees, buildings and underground tunnels.

Gameplay has more action than Driller. The Freescape world has a third dimension - due to the jetpack you can leave the ground and look down on the view. You can also rotate the angle and make quick U-turns. You must leave the ground to shoot the active part of an ECD, but the jetpack uses energy at a faster rate, so use this feature sparingly. You must avoid Plexors, which weaken your shield, and deflector devices, which can beam you into prison.</desc>

There are 25 levels, each of which is automatically mapped as you explore it. Use turbolifts to get to them. Each object is managed by the game, and a notepad feature is provided to allow you to keep track of vital information.</desc>

		<desc>Tom Cruise's film brought NASCAR racing to the masses, and Mindscape did the same for games players with this license. If you mentally change the driver names, it can be thought of as a recreation of real NASCAR racing rather than a direct recreation of the film. 

You play Cruise's Cole Trickle character (his name, like many of the others, is slightly different to that of a real NASCAR racer of the day) against your rivals on 8 tracks, based on real-life counterparts. The races are all on ovals, although the exact lengths, corner types and gradients are varied.  This means that the ideal racing line on one track can put you into the wall on another. Qualifying is incorporated alongside the races themselves.

From times to times you'll have to pull into the pit stop area. When doing so, you control the five members of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will make you loose positions at the race. The other racers, however, never pit.

The NES version has 3rd-Person perspective only.</desc>

After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, you start the game with a single castle and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.

The game has several different styles: You may either engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse using a lance, you can go raid a castle for loot or you can attack another territory/castle.

The game was originally created on the Amiga platform in 1986 by Cinemaware with wonderful graphics by James D. Sachs and great music by Jim Cuomo, then ported to the PC whilst keeping its original appeal and quality.</desc>

Before the exit is activated, all the mines on a screen must be cleared by running the beam over them.

		<desc>Déjà Vu: A Nightmare Comes True!! is the first game made by ICOM, known for its adventure games such as Shadowgate and Uninvited. It featured mouse support, a multi-window interface, and bitmapped graphics at a time when text-based interactive fiction was the norm.

In Deja Vu, action takes place in Chicago in December 1941. Your character's name is Theodore "Ace" Harding - a retired boxer working as a private eye. He wakes up in a toilet stall of a sleazy pub with no memory of who he is or what he is doing there. To make matters worse, you as him soon stumble upon a very dead corpse upstairs with three bullets buried in him. Sure enough, you find there's a gun in your pocket with three bullets missing. From there you have to figure out what happened and who you are before whatever is happening to your brain turns you into a mindless vegetable. To make matters worse the cops would very much like to have a word with you about that stiff.</desc>

		<desc>Deja Vu II: Lost in Las Vegas is a point-and-click adventure game, the sequel to Deja Vu: a Nightmare Comes True!!, set in the world of 1940s hard-boiled detective novels and movies.

Deja Vu II uses the full windowing capabilities of the Amiga, and play is almost 100% by mouse. Word icons are used to enter command verbs, and the picture and/or a graphical representation of a carried object is used to complete the command. Click on EXAMINE, and then click on an object in the picture, and a description of it is displayed in the text window. More common verbs like TAKE or DROP are executed by simply dragging the required object from picture into an INVENTORY window and vice versa.

If that is not enough, there is extensive animation within the picture. But, disappointingly, on the Amiga there is no soundand the digitised sound of a railway station, with steam trains arriving and porters shouting "All aboard" is sadly absent in comparison with the Atari ST version. The Amiga picture, too, when using a TV, is of poorer quality than that on the ST, and the window titles are very indistinct.</desc>

		<name>Disc</name>
		<desc>Disc is a game of fast reflexes and clever thinking. You control one player against the computer or another person. The objective is to finish off your opponents by knocking him off the platforms or by making the platform disappear by hitting the walls behind your opponents. Your weapon is a disc, which you can throw at your opponent or at the walls. The disc will ricochet off the walls, opening a wide range of angles and attacks. You can also try a direct hit at your opponents, as enough of these will eliminate him as well, but be careful - since it gives him a chance to block your disc, thus gain control of it!
As you progress through the levels, from Novice, through Disciple, up to a Great Guide, your rivals become tougher, platforms take longer hits to disappear, and there are more discs on the playing field.</desc>

		<desc>In this highly detailed game of exploration and conquest, you can send out ships in search of new lands; when such lands have been found, you can begin to create settlements - starting with clearing forests to make way for buildings!
Then towns and cities can spring up in much the same way as modern day America has developed. Discovery is a game that involves competing against several other major powers, whether you decide to play on Earth or on one of the other five worlds. See your settlers and soldiers come to life from a unique 3D perspective, use your maps to plan a strategy, and learn about Columbus' era rom the optional multi media screens. Be prepared for battles at sea, and attacks on land - from pirates and even fellow explorers. Few play by the rules in the race to discover the New World. Should you?</desc>

		<name>Amazing Spider-Man and Captain America in Dr., The</name>
		<desc>Latverian president Dr. Doom is a terrible enemy, so when he hatches a plan to blow up New York City with a stolen Atomic bomb, one Marvel superhero is not enough to stop him. As the lavishly-drawn comic bundled with the game explains, Spider-Man and Captain America must join forces to go to Latveria and foil his plans.

The main action in the game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up, in which you alternately control the two characters. They each have their own moves to deal with The Rhino, Electro and other foes. Moves are context-sensitive based on the distance between your character and the opponent. Energy bars decrease as you each take hits. After each section you get comic-book sequences as a reward, and to set the scene of the evolving story.</desc>

Gameplay is influenced by Commando, with levels scrolling in a single direction at a time and featuring hordes of enemies moving towards you. Buildings and trees offer positions to hide behind, and occasionally launch safe attacks. 

Before each mission you must buy your range of weapons and enough ammunition for them. These include pistols, machine guns, anti-tank devices and grenade launchers, each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses detailed.</desc>

		<name>Double Dragon</name>
		<desc>Set in a post-apocalyptic New York, Double Dragon is the story of Billy and Jimmy Lee, twin brothers trained in the fighting style of Sou-Setsu-Ken. Together, they manage a small martial arts training school, teaching their students in self-defense. One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street by the "Black Warriors", a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian.

Using whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy.

The NES version of this game also has an additional VS. fighting mode for one or two players. Players choose from a field of six different characters (Billy and 5 of the enemy characters) and enter into a one-on-one fighting match. Players have to punch, kick, jumpkick, and even use a weapon against their opponents until someone's health bar is fully drained. The winner is the last one standing.</desc>

		<desc>Zambaquous has done everything to make life hell for the people of Agamen, and as their King Kayus, the time has come to head out to destroy him. This leads to six levels of horizontally-scrolling shoot ‘em up action, although with some vertical movement as well.

The thing which sets the game apart from every other horizontally-scrolling shoot ‘em up (except Saint Dragon) is that you are riding on the back of a dragon, called Bahamoot. Both you and the dragon have firepower, and holding down the fire button increases Bahamoot’s energy bolt’s ferocity. The dragon’s tail can be controlled indirectly, and because it is indestructible, it can be used either as a shield, or as a weapon in its own right. 

There are power-ups to collect by dismounting from the dragon and walking into them. These include fiery breath, bolts shot from Bahamoot’s tail, homing missiles of sorts, and lightning bolts, with only one ever active at a time. Each level has a time limit.</desc>

Of course there are enemies which try to stop the player and can be destroyed by using the dragon's fire breath. Besides the artifact collecting, the game plays out as a traditional multi-directional scrolling shooter. There are five levels with eight artifacts each.</desc>

		<name>Duck Tales - The Quest for Gold</name>
		<desc>This game follows the adventures of Scrooge McDuck and his three nephews, Huey, Dewey and Louie.

The aim of the game is shown in the introduction. Flintheart Glomgold challenges Scrooge to a competition to see who the richest duck in the world is. They each have 30 days to see who can get the most money together and finally their dispute will be settled.

Scrooge's office is your headquarters. Here you have three options ? you can go exploring for treasure, play the stock market or dive into your money bin, occasionally finding a rare coin which adds to you treasure total. You need to get some money first before you can play the stock market though.

You main source of income comes from the exploration map which hangs on the wall. From here, you can pick a destination, which you can travel to. There are four different scenarios when travelling to various parts of the world. It's these levels that are the most fun. You can choose to go mountain climbing, jungle bashing, search a cavern, or photograph some rare animals depending on your location. On screen information tells you which scenario it is, how long the trip will take and how much the treasure is worth. There's also an island in the Indian Ocean you can visit to check on who's winning between you and Glomgold.

You have to fly to each location and your transport is LaunchPad McQuack! You have to take off at the airport and fly to the destination. There are obstacles along the way though, watch out for powerlines (these are really funny, you run into them and boing! bounce back); hot air balloons dropping refrigerators, anvils, 10 ton weights and pianos; cumulo nimbus clouds shooting lightening and fluffly clouds; whales blowing water out their spouts; tall mountains, rocky outcrops, fireworks, hay barns among other things. Landing on the other side requires a special skill ? Launchpads! You have to crash into the airport to land! Crash the plane though and it takes two days of your valuable time limit for Gyro Gearloose to fix it.

Using Huey, Dewey and Louie, each being one of your three lives in the mountain climbing level, you must get from the base of the mountain to the top to get your treasure. Using the boys, you can hop from ledge to ledge, or when the going gets tough, use your grappling hook! This is a lot of fun and requires precision. There are also caves in the side of the mountain, which can transport you up or down the mountain. But watch out for bears in the caves. Other obstacles i</desc>

		<desc>Side-scrolling beat 'em ups in which you must rescue a trapped female friend are nothing unusual. Being able to use direct-combat moves as well as collecting bonus weapons, and food for energy recharging, is pretty typical as well. Games of this type that were converted from the arcade to home computers are particularly commonplace - Renegade and the Double Dragon series are famous examples.

Where this one stands out, however, is the setting of your character as a duck called Bin, and with motion having a clear waddling appearance. The enemies to fight are all from the animal kingdom, but somewhat warped - crocodiles with boxing moves and cows armed with rocket packs for example. Bin has six levels to clear before he can rescue Lucy from Archaca's clutches.</desc>

		<name>Dynasty Wars</name>
		<desc>Conversion of the Capcom arcade to home computers. The player adopts the identity of an ancient Chinese warrior, and riding on horseback has to eliminate all his opponents, mostly infantry and archers.

The game uses a lateral scroll and the player can move in all four directions. A novelty is the attack system: when pressing fire the energy of the attack will load up as the warrior moves his spear up and backwards, in order to gain momentum. The more the player can keep fire pressed, the more powerful the attack will be.

The game spawned a sequel in the arcades, "Warriors of fate", and is not to be confused with the PSX game of the same title, which is a one-on-one fighting game.</desc>

		<desc>Eco is an action strategy game of sorts, which sets you in charge initially of a small single-celled organism, and challenges you to guide its evolution. Your initial tasks are to roam around finding food, and then find a potential mate. Depending on your organism's status, different predators will be after you - a radar is displayed to indicate where these are at any given time. Once this is done, you are taken to a screen displaying the species' genes, and you have the chance to modify one of them, thus resulting in evolution. Eventually you can evolve far enough to become plant, insect, fish or even human.</desc>

		<path>./Elite (1988)(Firebird)[cr].zip</path>
		<name>Elite</name>
		<desc>Elite is a free-form space trading and combat simulation, commonly considered the progenitor of this sub-genre. The player initially controls a character referred to as "Commander Jameson", starting at Lave Station with 100 credits and a lightly armed trading ship called Cobra Mark III. Most of the game consists of traveling to various star systems, trading with their inhabitants, gaining money and reputation. Money can also be gained by other means beside trading; these include undertaking military missions, bounty hunting, asteroid mining, and even piracy. As the player character earns money, he becomes able to upgrade his ships with enhancements such as better weapons, shields, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, etc.

The game utilizes pseudo-3D wire-frame graphics; its world is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has no overarching story, though a race known as Thargoids play the role of antagonists: their ships will often attack the player-controlled ship, forcing the player to engage in space combat. Combat is action-oriented, taking place in the same environment as the exploration. The player must use various weapons the ship is equipped with, as well as manoeuvre the ship, trying to dodge enemy attacks. The player can also choose to attack neutral ships; doing so will decrease the protagonist's reputation, eventually attracting the attention of the galactic police.

Elite is notable for its expansive game world, consisting of eight galaxies and 256 planets. The player is free to travel to any of these planets, provided his ship has enough fuel for the trip (the ship's fuel capacity is limited for a journey to the distance of seven light years).</desc>

A task that is by no means easy. On your way to Traskor, the capital of Damiran, you will meet every warped creature evil Plogthor can possibly send at you — who will all want to prevent you from achieving your ultimate goal: Restoring the Heart of Lore. 
Thalion. Well... what's left to say?</desc>

		<name>Enduro Racer</name>
		<desc>In this game you play the role of an endurance bike racer. The gameplay involves you racing against the clock to get to the finish line and jumping over ramps. At the end of each race you get points for how many cars or bikes you have overtaken with which you can upgrade your bike.
There are various different terrain for you to race on including desert beach and dirt tracks plus a number of things to slow you down or even knock you off of your bike all together. The main idea is to find the best route through each level to shave off valuable seconds in order to over take more cars and bikes.

The Japanese version of the game has more Tracks than the European and US versions have. Among  them is a snow track which is one of the hardest tracks in the game, because there is a lot of stones on the thin road.</desc>

		<desc>Featuring the English national squad in a top-down soccer game, England Championship Special represents British publisher Grand Slam's attempt to cash in on both England's respectable semi-final entry at the 1990 World Cup and the popularity of Anco's acclaimed Kick Off series. With its 1991 release, English Championship Special is somewhat awkwardly set in between the 1990 World Cup (England made the semi finals, its best result since 1966, then lost to Germany and to Italy in the third-place match) and the European Championship of 1992, to which the "Championship Special" part of the title refers.</desc>

		<name>Exolon</name>
		<desc>This action game combines shoot 'em up and platform elements, as you control a flying man who can gain an exoskeletal suit for extra protection (hence the name). Your task is to progress from left to right in each level, either along the ground or by using the arrangement of platforms. Most of the baddies can be avoided rather than shot, and this is often easier, especially as you can duck or jump to avoid them. As well as a standard gun (activated by tapping fire) you also have a limited number of missiles to take out installations (activated by holding down fire, which makes autofire facilities useless). The scrolling is flick-screen, perhaps as the game was designed for the C64, and the Amiga version was identical to the ST's.</desc>

		<name>Extase</name>
		<desc>The screen display in Extase depicts a symmetrical network of wires, some buttons, some fuses, some switches, and a picture of a female android in the middle. The overall aim is to restore sensory functions to the android, one in each level. All of this is done against an opponent, either human or computer, who controls the opposite half of the board.

This is done by guiding electrical pulses through each of the wires, however this can only be done once the wires have been woken up. You are in control of a cursor, which can click on the activation buttons to release a ball, which you direct using the cursor to reactivate wires on its path. Switches must be set to make all parts of this available – this can only be done when no ball is active.

Electrical sparks move around to make life harder, by destroying balls and fuses. Fortunately these can be 'zapped' using the cursor. New fuses can be generated by guiding a power beam into the fusebox, which is located centrally – simply pick up and place a generated fuse.

Better still, you can steal your opponent's, which is one of many ways the game becomes directly competitive. The two cursors cannot occupy the same space on screen, so hitting your opponent's cursor will jolt it. You can also adjust switches on both sides of the board, and summon sparks for your opponent to deal with. As the android is reactivated during the level it shows a range of facial expressions as a visual reward and measure of your progress.</desc>

You'll have to work through seven houses, each of which has the typical rooms. You control a seemingly-dismembered hand, which must deal with the hordes as they come towards it, into the screen. They can be shot, thumped, or squashed depending on their type. To clear a room you must kill a certain number of creatures in each of the vertically-divided 'lanes' of the room - this causes squares on the ground to change colour.</desc>

It is up to you to plan your flight route by setting waypoints on the tactical map prior to take-off; you can also (but need not) select the armament of your plane. When you have accumulated enough flight experience, you may command entire squadrons in the fictional Operation Conquest campaign, a simple simulation of an entire war theater that already hinted at what would later become DI’s Virtual Battlefield.

		<desc>Fernandez is a despot who has invaded the Republic of El Diablo, bringing terror to the local people. The rightful leaders of the country have called you in to destroy Fernandez's hideouts and bring his country back to the people.

Fundamentally this is a Commando clone, scrolling vertically and with hordes of enemies to be taken on, with finding good shielding spots and launching surprise attacks an especially useful strategy.You have unlimited bullets and limited but collectible grenades to use. There are landmines to avoid, and medical packs to pick up.

On each of the 8 levels you must destroy Fernandez's buildings, which are accessed through an underground network of tunnels. You're not limited to being on foot - you start off in a jeep and can also use motorbikes, tanks and similar, although losing a life destroys this. In 2-player mode you can split driving and gunning duties. When starting a new game, you always start from the point at which you died in the last game.</desc>

		<name>Final Blow</name>
		<desc>Final Blow is an action game based around the sport of boxing. You can play the fighters in a sequence of knock-out competitions, (the computer versions also include a round-robin league). Rounds last one minute, with a short break in between them. As in the real sport, your aim is to knock your opponent down for 10 seconds, by gradually weakening him with a series of punches. You can block punches, to avoid them inflicting damage onto you. The ring is of a limited size, so players can be cornered, although the referee will intervene to break the boxers up if they become entangled in a stalemate position.

The genesis version is not to be confused with the Master System game of the same name, which is entirely different.</desc>

Arriving in the new unknown land, you are defenceless hence your fists and kicks. But as you journey forth, you'll find your trusty magical sword as well as throwing weapons such as knives and axes. With your martial art skills, your enemy best beware with those sudden moves that may prove fatal!

		<desc>Fed up with football (soccer) management games, with all the match strategies, financial turmoil and prima donna players? This game offers a unique twist, leaving you 'managing' the career of a single player, involving matches and transfers.

You start with 10 'goal cards' - up to 3 can be played in each match, each of them giving you a shooting chance, at which point arcade action skill comes in. The better you perform, the higher your wages are, the more chance you have of a big-money transfer and international call-up, and the less chance you have of being dropped from the team.

There's also a trivia section, which asks increasingly difficult questions allowing you to go double or nothing on knowing the answers - up to £8000 a time can be won on this.</desc>

Enemies were laughing at him, and other dwarfs were attacking him. What he should do? Yes, he should find and defeat Ultimor, return his size to be brave and noble enough, and to win back his belle.

The gameplay flows in 2D side-scrolling mode, where you may use your sword, throw the daggers, and avoid the enemies. You may walk, jump and run, and perform this not in one plane. Background, foreground and middle planes are available to change. The daggers should be thrown to eliminate as enemies with range weapons as flying and hard-to-reach ones. Different items should be collected such as keys, other daggers, etc. 

There are several themed levels such as forest, grotto, castle, etc. in the game. To finish the level you should find the key and proceed with it to the entrance of next level. Your energy is represented by apples, and you should collect them also. Sometimes magic star appears on the level. It should be destroyed to eliminate all visible enemies. Magic potions are also differ either to give invincibility or to restore your energy.</desc>

		<desc>The Earth has been under siege by evil aliens from the planet MOZONE for centuries. The planet can not be saved - it's time to find a new home for humanity. A heavily armed ship is sent ahead to scout for such a place - naturally, lots of MOZONE ships stand in the way.

Frenetic is a traditional vertically scrolling shoot'em'up. The action moves through eight levels, set both in space and on the ground (with such environments as a jungle planet and a water world). While most levels have a technological theme, some feature organic enemies and backgrounds, reminiscent of games like R-Type or Xenon 2. Going with tradition, each level has a huge end boss.

The player's ship can collect a variety of power-ups: lasers and missiles, shooting to the front, the back or the sides. Speed-ups and shields are also available. Power-ups are revealed by destroying certain enemies or special bonus capsules, and several are given to the player for free at the start of a level. The weapons can be upgraded by collecting the same power-up several times.

The game features a two-player mode, with two ships moving against the aliens at the same time.</desc>

		<name>Frontier - Elite II</name>
		<desc>The original game, ELITE, shook the computer games industry to its foundations as the first 3D polygon space simulation back in the mid 198O's. The game was an unprecedented success and grew to such cult status that games' players formed their 'ELITE Fan Club'.
 A feat yet to be repented, the standard was set and gave rise to a multitude of sci-fi simulation "wannabees".
Now as popular as ever, this unique style of game has been taken to the limit with the astonishing FRONTIER ELITE II</desc>

		<name>Full Metal Planete</name>
		<desc>Tie-in of the rather unknown but truly brilliant board game of the same name. Up to four players land on a planet with their motherships, trying to gather as much ore as possible within 24 game rounds.

This almost sounds like a happy, idyllic round of pick-the-flowers... if it wasn't for the truckload of tanks and destroyers that each players happens to have in the cargo area of his mothership. So the players usually spend an equal amount of time picking up ore and bashing their contenders' heads in.

The computer game is an extremely accurate conversion of the board game - virtually every aspect has been taken care of.

What's especially refreshing about this game is that it does not rely on luck - it's pure strategy. The only semi-random thing are the tides (high tide, low tide, and something inbetween) which can strand boats and engulf tanks, but even they can be partially predicted.</desc>

		<name>Future Basketball</name>
		<desc>One of the first Speedball clones takes the basic court layout of basketball as its inspiration. There are 5 players on each team, on a small court with 2 and 3 point shooting areas. The difference is that physical contact of a fairly violent nature is allowed, and the court is littered with mines and bombs to wound the players. Shooting involves holding down fire to get the height right, so avoid being tackled as you prepare your shot. Other basketball rules such as double-dribbling and the 25-second hand-over are unsurprisingly waived. A 3-division league is included to progress through.</desc>

		<name>Gem'X</name>
		<desc>Like so many other puzzle games of the time, this game involves tiles of different colours, which must be manipulated to clear a succession of increasingly-difficult levels.

The basic idea is that you are presented with 2 sets of tiles, and must make the left one identical to the 'control' set on the right. The colours are defined in a sequence - red, green, blue, purple, yellow - and when you click on a tile, that tile's colour moves forward by two in that sequence (for example a blue one becomes yellow), whereas the tiles next to it move by one colour (for example, blue becomes purple). 

Any that move past the end fo the sequence disappear, causing surrounding blocks to drop. You get a limited number of moves, and limited time as well. Fortuantely there are passwords, delivered by cutely-drawn naked Japanese girls (although the private parts are covered up).</desc>

Gemini Wing is a vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up, which is distinguished by its unusual power-up system. Instead of gaining occasional tokens which lead to lasting weaponry improvements, occasional flurries of tokens are released to ensure a quick burst of improved fire. The organic backgrounds are detailed, and have many sections which fire at you.</desc>

		<desc>Ghost Battle is one of the earlier games by the German company Thalion Software, who later produced such 16-bit classics as RPGs Amberstar and its sequel Ambermoon, and the platforming masterpiece Lionheart. Spanning five short yet brutally difficult worlds, the game borrows its visual style heavily from its better-known contemporaries like Shadow of the Beast and Ghosts 'n' Goblins.

A simple arcade-style action game with some rudimentary adventuring and timing based puzzles thrown in, Ghost Battle casts you as a nameless hero on a quest to rescue his, yet again, nameless girlfriend from a nameless bad guy. Enemies have a horror look and feel to them - ghouls and disembodied heads for example. Initially our hero is armed with rocks, but extra weapons can be collected for specific tasks such as the bosses who end each level.</desc>

Teams from various European countries are included, and you can customise these by moving players around, and changing the starting lineups and formations. An Arcade Challenge mode sees you play matches against each of the 5 computer team speeds, in succession, until you lose one - you can also arrange leagues or play individual matches.

A wide range of options are included, with variable wind settings, a range of pitches and referees, variable match lengths, and the chance to play up/down or left/right, a choice of close or distant view, and variable computer speed and skill (these can be combined to vary the game quite significantly).</desc>

		<desc>In Gold Rush!, Jerrod Wilson (the player) receives a letter from his long-lost brother (who fled the city years before when was hastily accused and convicted of a crime he didn't commit) asking him to join in Sacramento, California. If that's not enough for Jerrod sell everything and give his hometown Brooklyn a fond adieu, under the stamp was one of the first nuggets of Californian gold seen in the Atlantic shores of the United States. So, Jerrod bids farewell to his peaceful life as a newspaper editor, and becomes a fore-runner in the the great Gold Rush of 1849, hoping to find his brother and "strike gold" (literally).

Released late into the lifespan of Sierra's AGI engine, Gold Rush! features some tricks not seen before the more advanced SCI engine, such as enlarged characters, but it is best known for the three routes available to reach California: by land, travel by boat to reach the Atlantic shore of Panama, cross the isthmus, and then get a second boat in the Pacific shore, or making the dangerous all-boat trip by Cape Horn. Each route has it's dangers: Cholera might strike as you make your way across the Northern states or your boat might sink.. As usual with Sierra adventures, instant killing happens if the player is careless, but will also happen at random. Other important (and innovative) concept is the game being timed. If Jerrod takes too long to leave Brooklyn, passages to California increase in price, and his house devalues.</desc>

		<desc>Sega's classic arcade beat-'em-up game, Golden Axe puts in the shoes of one of three heroes, each with his own reason for trying to overthrow the evil rule of Death-Adder, who - along with his forces of darkness - kidnapped and imprisoned the King and his daughter and stole the legendary Golden Axe.

This is a horizontal fighting game, where you basically take one of the three characters (a warrior, a dwarf or an amazon) and bash everything which stands between you and Death Adder himself.</desc>

		<name>Golden Path, The</name>
		<desc>Y'n Hsi is a Buddhist monk whose father was murdered by a warlord called Ch'un Kuei. In order to defeat the tyrant and regain his family's palace, he must tread the golden path, the road to transcendence.

The Golden Path is a point and click adventure game. Instead of using verbs like in Maniac Mansion, the player controls the monk with the mouse by moving a cursor shaped like a Chinese letter and clicking directly at him on the screen. Left-clicking on a spot on the ground moves the monk towards it. Left-clicking below Y'n Hsi makes him bend over to drop or pick objects on the ground. Left-clicking above his head makes him try to use the object he is holding at the moment (if it is not possible to do so, a question mark appears). Right-clicking makes him punch and kick, his defense against enemies. Every time the monk is hit, the inventory briefly flashes. A book sits at the bottom-left of the screen, and serves as a hint system of sorts. When clicking on it, a message about the screen appears with explanations to events, characters and objects. Besides the book is the inventory with four slots for objects. Left-clicking on an object places it on Y'n Hsi hands. Above the inventory is a slowly withering vine as the energy bar. It grows with the completion of certain tasks. 

The main objective is to follow the golden path. Literally. On the bottom-right of the screen there is a small version of the main game screen that shows the path and its bifurcations. The character moves from screen to screen collecting things laying around, fighting the occasional enemy and using the right object at the right place.

Pressing S saves the game, while typing L loads it.</desc>

		<desc>My Story...Fifty years ago, my Grandfather, a brave and bold warrior, defeated a powerful
force of space pirates to secure a new world for the human race, who were fleeing from the now dead Earth. The past five decades of life on the Ring-Worlds of Triton have altered the life of the Human Race. Man is no longer a warrior; his technological advancement has bred a new fighter. Robot pilots now defend his new home. With no concept of fear and reactions a little slower than the speed of light, they are the formidable force which has prevented reprisals from the pirates; until now.
In a daring and swift surprise raid, most of these robot pilots were captured by the pirates, and are now being held on the 16 disused space research platforms on which they were forced to take refuge. The pirates are probably planning an attack on the Ring-Worlds which, now undefended, will undoubtedly fall; especially it our own robots are used against us. It is imperative that these robots are returned, or at least destroyed, otherwise the Human race will come to an end.</desc>

An alien species called "Outies" plans on transforming all suns of the galaxy into black holes. They feed off raw energy, and as black holes are a good source of that, they attempt to create as many as possible of them. The player is sent out in a scout ship to colonise worlds in an attempt to gain resources to use for battling the Outies.</desc>

This tennis simulation has some nice features. First you create your player. You can distribute some character points (for example: speed, forehand, backhand, etc.) like a role-playing game. These skills will raise after a few winning matches. Then you must select the tournaments you will play. There are all ATP tournaments for choice-  you can also play the Davis Cup. After every tournament you get some price money. There you must play the single and double matches.

In training you can also play against a ball machine or against a friend. It's also possible to play 1 against 2.</desc>

You're starting into the adventure as a real hacker would do, lacking information of what is to come, only driven by your ambition. Consequently, the game opens with a plain text screen, prompting you for the login password. To break into the system is the first puzzle you've got to solve.

Once in, you'll soon find out that you've accidentally stumbled upon a conspiracy of global impact. From then on, you'll maneuver a robotic drone around the globe through a tunnel system deep in the earth. In major cities, you may surface and talk to contact persons, who'll trade items for cash. When delivered to the correct city, you can exchange these items for a piece of evidence. If all evidence is collected, you're to inform the FBI. As if figuring out the correct routes and trades wasn't hard enough, frequent system malfunctions and security checks test your skill as well...</desc>

Hacker II: The Doomsday Papers opens with the console to the "Actisource" computer hotline system (a nice self-ironic pun - although nobody knows why a serious hacker might want to crack a help service for computer games...). However, your quiet little hack is soon disturbed: The government wants you for a secret mission. It, again, involves a robot drone and you're the one at the remote control. Although this time, it's not the whole globe that's your playground, but a high security facility in Russia, where the plans for global domination are hidden.</desc>

		<name>Hard Drivin'</name>
		<desc>Hard Drivin' is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. You are in control of a high-performance sports car. Your objective is to race around the course as fast as possible and hit as many checkpoints as possible. If you hit a checkpoint you gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the road both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass... 

The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so on. 

Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is "reset" and you get up to speed again. 

The home conversions retain most of the then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the force-feedback that was in the arcade version.</desc>

		<name>Hawkeye</name>
		<desc>A bi-directional horizontally scrolling platform game, Hawkeye has the player in control of an SLF (Synthetic Life Form) controlled from an underground bunker by the Xamoxians. On each level, the eyes of the hawks in the status panel flash to indicate the direction to travel in to find a puzzle piece. Four pieces are needed to complete the level, but there were also other pickups such as ammo and energy. There were 12 levels to complete plus a hidden bonus level.

The player has a choice of four different weapons. The basic pistol had unlimited ammo but did little damage. The machine gun had a faster rate of fire, the laser did more damage and most powerful of all was the rocket launcher - but all three soon ran out of ammo.

The game features parallax scrolling backgrounds and large numbers of enemies (including large rhinos, triceratops and gorillas).</desc>

The game is presented from an isometric perspective, and presents the characters with a number of puzzles involving switches, jumps and climbs. The levels are 3 dimensional, and the characters must collect crowns as they progress. Objects can be picked up and manipulated as necessary.</desc>

		<name>Heavy Metal</name>
		<desc>This multi-genre military action game puts player in the seat of tactical commander of mechanized forces. Starting as Cadet, you'll raise your career from the rookie, when you should perform actions by yourself in different vehicles, to the ultimate elite, when you should act as a Tactical genius. 

There are three kinds of combat simulations:
1. MBT (main battle tank M1A1 Abrams), where in first-person view you should sit in tank's cockpit, command your gunner and driver, and eliminate surrounding enemies;

2. FAV (fast attack vehicle XR311), where in third-person view you should drive your vehicle in desert, shoot scattered obstacles and enemy helicopters, and avoid the bombs dropped from the skies ;

3. ADAT (air defense anti-tank M1132A), where in first-person view you should shoot air and ground enemies, surrounding your statical position.
Performing useful actions in each mode, you'll gain points, and gathering 5,000 points in each mode will give you a seat of Tactical Commander. Here you'll be able to continue your actions on the field, or perform some tactical moves using the map, which is very similar to the territory, including and surrounding Western Germany.</desc>

		<desc>The famous fantasy-themed board game was converted into an isometric-viewed role playing game in which the evil Wizard Morcar must be defeated. You take control of a wizard, a dwarf, a barbarian and an elf, each with different strengths and weaknesses, who each start the 14 missions from opposite sides of the board.

Strict turn-based movement rules apply, as actions other than movement can only be carried out before or after the move, the size of which is limited by a dice roll. These moves are carried out using an icon-based system. Characters can fight the many monsters which lurk, or cast spells to vanquish them. There are magic potions to uncover, but also hidden traps, so mapping is advised. Treasure can be collected, and traded at the shop after each level.</desc>

		<name>Honda RVF</name>
		<desc>RVF Honda puts you on board a realistically-modeled RC30 bike, with the task of becoming world champion. Initially you race at Clubman level on fictitious local tracks (one of which is set in MicroProse's old UK home of Tetbury), before moving up to UK and then World championship racing if you're good enough.

Each class of racing has 8 computer opponents, with the top 7 finishers in each of the championship's 8 races scoring points, and the races can be set to 5,10, 15 or 20 laps. The game's graphics appear to feature sprite-based bikes atop polygon scenery, which makes for very fast gameplay. 

The circuits feature puddles of water to upset the bike's handling, and oil, which causes you to crash. It takes time to remount the bike and get back up to speed by revving it back up (more realistic than most motorbike games at the time, but frustrating as you suffer for mistakes more), and after a couple of crashes the bike's dashboard fails, making it much harder to ride competitively.

There is a two-player null-modem link-up mode, which can support an ST racing against an Amiga if you have the right cable.</desc>

Fully 3D, you have the choice to go anywhere you please during any mission. A focus is put on freedom of choice; there's no one way to complete a mission. You can take control of any vehicle in the game, and these range from riding pedal bikes and windsurfing, to vans and ambulances, to tanks and armoured cars, to battleships and helicopters. Your arsenal includes grenades, explosives, various gadgets and a handgun, though deadlier weapons are mounted on some of the vehicles. Or if you prefer, you can acquire an enemy uniform and sneak in rather than blast your way through.

There are also many structures to be found, many containing regular citizens who may be interacted with (talking to them, bribing them...), though there are also more specialised structures which may contain vehicles, ammo, or anything you might find useful to your mission.</desc>

		<name>Immortal, The</name>
		<desc>The Immortal is an isometric action-adventure game.

Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of 
isometric death await.

The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards. In short: You want to see what challenge lies in the next room.

The puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps to the correct use of items; you collect objects in an inventory. Every now and then, The Immortal surprises with a special challenge. For example, you've got to ride a magic carpet through a hallway full of fire traps, or ride a barrel on an underground river. The dungeon isn't empty: some friedlies may have valuable information or trade items, the nasty sort of guys will attack. Combat is fought man-to-man on a special screen. Your adversary indicates his next attack a few seconds before he executes it, so you've got time to react appropriately. You can dodge to the left or the right, as well as attack from these two directions. There is no save option in the game, of course, but you may restart each level as often as you like. Levels can be skipped by entering passwords.</desc>

		<name>Impossamole</name>
		<desc>Monty Mole has been living in luxury since his previous adventures, but he has now been beamed up by an alien race who want him to do a job for them. Monty must trek through five worlds to retrieve the sacred scrolls of the race's Guardians. 

As with Core's previous hit Rick Dangerous 2 there is versatility in the exact structure of the game. The first four consist of the Orient, a Klondike mine, an Ice world and an Amazon forest - once these are completed the final world is open to you.

The platform-based gameplay is similar to Monty's earlier games, with primarily horizontal progresses as well as ropes and ladders to navigate. Monty has developed a useful flying kick, and has been given a smart bomb, with the potential to collect extra bombs and guns. Hazards, enemies and level designs are themed around each level, and range from cable cars and falling snowballs to Ninjas and Monkeys.</desc>

		<name>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</name>
		<desc>The computer versions of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom are conversions of the Atari arcade game based on the second movie in the series. As Indy you must complete several cycles of the following 3 types of levels:Mine level: Whip your way through a mine in order to free children that are held captive. Use your whip to swing across chasms, climb ladders, ride along conveyor belts and defend yourself against attacks from Thuggee guards, bats, snakes and the fireball-throwing Mola ram. Escape with the mine cart after you've freed all children.
2. Mine cart level: Pick the right route through a network of tracks while riding in a mine cart. Avoid potholes, broken tracks &amp; guards in carts and safely reach the end of the track.
3. Temple level: Make your way to the altar and grab the Sankara stone while Mola Ram, bats and Thuggee guards attack you. Watch out for that lava.
With every cycle the mine &amp; mine cart levels become more complex, the layout of the temple levels is always the same. After several cycles there's a showdown with Mola Ram on the rope bridge.</desc>

		<desc>INDY HEAT is fast and furious racing action where a decidedly mean streak may just keep you out in front.
With the money you win, plan your attack for ten different circuits - do you play safe with better brakes or go for it with more engine power? Do you boost your turbo or your crew? - the decision is yours.
With a combination of skill, nerve and a few dirty tricks (like running over other teams pit crews!) maybe you would end up being showered with champagne and kisses.</desc>

The game is viewed in 3D from Solar's perspective, with a full HUD built into his helmet showing direction, health and supplies. Other HUDs also allow you to check whether the current air is breathable (you have limited oxygen), as well as one built into your Jetpack.

There are two movement modes, one of which allows you to pan the view and the other allows you to shoot. Objects have to be picked up and used, computers operated, and an infra-red kit located and used. To win the game you will have to destroy all the eggs, and then shut the compound down and escape in time.</desc>

		<desc>Dreams are made by The Dreamtrack Corporation, a group of evil subliminal-messengers whose intention is to destroy the minds of the minority of people capable of interpreting other people's dreams and live them out through entertainment. That's the story in this distinctly Cyberpunk-inspired title, and you play Chad, the man who discovers this secret, and aims to put an end to it.

Your task on each level is to clear a path for Kaf-E, your girlfriend, to be able to progress to the heart of the Dreamtrack HQ, getting past each of the myriad of security systems they have built up. A map must be used to navigate the route through the systems, with lots of information readily available.

The basic gameplay sees you darting through 3D tunnels using the mouse, and is like a prototype Descent, with your ship kitted out with cannons and missiles, with each enemy better dealt with by one or the other.

As well as ensuring your own survival, you must guide Kaf-E through the levels by blasting out the correct sections to clear a path for her. As she has no intelligence, and simply walks into walls, this element can be compared to Lemmings.</desc>

Three Allied soldiers have been captured, and you must infiltrate the facilities, rescue your brave comrades, destroy the building, and salvage as much of the stolen art treasures as possible.

There are eight levels to explore, each with a specific mission objective. Some of the paintings are loose, others are in crates which must first be shot. Explosives must be collected, not shot. With limited ammunition, guards everywhere, keys at a premium, and lots of strategic hiding points, an all-guns-blazing approach is less successful than a planned, measured one.</desc>

		<desc>World Class Soccer is a soccer (football) game that ties in with the 1990 football World Cup. The game uses a top-down perspective for matches and features the full World Cup structure and all the 24 teams who were involved. Multiple formations and team selections are available before each match. The ball sticks to the feet of the players, who can be tackled either by doing a block tackle, or attempting a slide tackle, which risks giving away a foul. Matches can vary between 4 and 90 minutes, and each player has differing skills and behaviour style depending on his team's relative ability.</desc>

You control Pond, a fish-like creature, who has to complete several missions, while making his way through levels full of dangers and hostile creatures. It is not a typical "jump and run" game: instead of breezing through large levels, Pond has to complete unique missions for each game area: free hostages, detonate a structure, find keys, etc. It is possible to exit a level only after having completed the objective. Many missions are timed.</desc>

The driving sections take place within George's Jetcar, and you must slow down for the speed-limited areas and beware of black holes.

At the beginning of the game, you are George Jetson, laborer of the Spacely Space Sprockets company in 2062. Your boss Mr. Spacely wants you to work, but you want to collect money and have fun. So after the boss's ordinary order, you can explore the company, as usual, collect money bills, and useful items, avoiding dangerous robotic mechanisms and Mr. Spacely himself.</desc>

There is also a "trick-shot" mode, allowing you to recreate classic snooker trick shots (well, not the one with the basket. Or with the cues lying on the table. Or the one with the girl lying on her back with the pink ball in her mouth. But you know).

And if you dawdle too long, the balls pull faces at you. Honest!</desc>

		<desc>Aquatania has recently become the land of misfortunes, due to a group of plotting witches. The task of finding five charms and a magic bracelet to put things right falls on you.

And you need a change of luck, because events in this game often emphasise the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. You get hit by a car, fall a great height, sprayed with cheese sandwich and more! Being the guinea pig in this strange world will drive you insane - if this jinxed land doesn't do it first. 

Jinxter is an interactive fiction with graphics title that takes a realistic world of people and situations, and then plays with the boundaries to create a strange and puzzling world. Characters are all getting on with their own tasks, and getting them to help you is usually a case of making sure something's in it for them.

Dialogue aims to add a comic touch to proceedings. Puzzles can often be solved in multiple ways, but the most obvious way is not always the correct one. Due to the presence of a Guardian, you can't actually die.</desc>

		<desc>As Players Software correctly predicted, London in 1995 is an unfriendly unsafe city ran by thugs. Innocent civilians who leave the house will almost certainly face violence. An acclaimed hero since his successes in the original, Joe Blade is the man to put things right - if he can kill 100 thugs and rescue 20 civilians within ten minutes, the thugs will retreat and the city will be saved.

As Joe, you must move through the streets and kill these thugs, by kicking them in the head (they have body armour). As in the first game, the streets are flick-screen and have many doorways linking them. Rescuing civilians involves touching them before completing a sub-game within a minute.

There are four subgame variants of increasing difficulty, all based around a 1-2-3-4 sequence of numbers. The first involves simply stopping the cursor as each one appears in order - pressing the wrong one sends you back to having to find a 1. In the second, the numbers are on screen in random order, a cursor cycling through them - press fire to swap the two numbers currently highlighted. In the third, you are presented with two jumbled sets and must put one of them in order, by swapping numbers across the two sets. In the fourth, you must form the sequence by swapping an ever-changing number into the right place, by pressing fire at the right moment.</desc>

		<name>John Barnes European Football</name>
		<desc>Released to coincide with the 1992 European Football Championships, and licensed around Jamaican-born Liverpool star John Barnes.

The gameplay is superficially similar to Krisalis' previous Manchester United Europe title. The action is viewed from side-on and overhead, giving a slight forced perspective. 

Unlike Manchester United Europe, only a small amount of the pitch is visible at a time, which makes the game faster, but makes long-range passing harder (perhaps to make the game more like Barnes' own style).

Control is precise and the ball sticks to your feet to some extent. The only teams included are the eight qualifiers for the 1992 European Championships, and that is the only tournament. You can play either as the nearest player to the ball, or always be Barnes.</desc>

		<desc>In Joust, players take control of a knight with a lance who rides their flying ostrich (or stork, for Player 2) to do battle against computer-controlled evil knights who ride atop vultures.

Players must flap their steed's wings to hit the enemy from a higher jousting point to destroy the vulture and its rider. Once the enemy has been hit, an egg falls to one of the platforms below. The heroic knights must destroy the eggs before they hatch and release new and increasingly more difficult knights. The three strengths of enemy knights are Bounder (red knight), Hunter (white knight), and Shadow Lord (blue knight). These enemy knights are not the only challenge to be found in the game. Players must also contend with crumbling platforms, lava trolls who attempt to pull knights into the fire, and the dreaded "unbeatable"(?) pterodactyl.

The game was novel for its time for being one of the few two-player simultaneous games in the arcade.</desc>

The task is simple - This is your 14th Tour of duty and within the living core of the Planet Spiraeus, is a deadly virus causing its brain to malfunction and all the inner sanctums to die as the life force is diminished. This planet is divided into four zones, each of which has four sectors. Trap doors in the floor and holes in the roof will enable you to move up or down a level. You MUST find and destroy the deadly 'tumour' within the deepest parts of the planet, before it becomes an empty shell driftin in the depths of Space and Time.
WARNING! - The planet's immune system will see the Jug as a hostile and alien body so you will be attacked by the defence system of the very planet that you are trying to save!
Vital equipment will be transported into the planet along your proposed trajectory to help you in your quest and fuel pods will be available throughout the game. But take heed, the problems will really start when you have reached the source of the disaster...
With bi-directional scrolling, parallax scrolling and the most stunning graphics possible on the ST, you must surely agree that JUG is a game that no one should be without.</desc>

This time, there are no trophies. This time, there are no points. This time, there are no referees.
"No referees? Then how do you know who wins?"
"Whoever dead, doesn't!"
Daniel LaRusso has entered the world of real Karate. A world without laws. A world where to win is to survive. And so the scene is set for the blockbuster film, the Karate Kid II.
Now you can grab a piece of the action. This is not just another Karate game. This is the game of the film. Guide Daniel through fight after fight against ever more powerful adversaries. Then face the evil Chozen himself in the Castle of King Shohashi, where you must discover the secret of the drum — or die!
"I don"t get it?"
"Practice, Daniel-san, practice. You will!"
But the fighting isn't all. Catch flies with chopsticks and break ice w ith your bare hand in full-size, animated graphic screens.
Daniel LaRusso faced the challenge. The boy became a man. The man became a hero. What will you do?
"Daniel-san! This is not tournament!

		<name>Kick Off</name>
		<desc>Kick Off was the first football game of its kind, having a top down view and unlike other football games of that time the ball was not glued to the feet of the players. Playing Kick Off requires skills in boll control. There is an option to learn these skills without being harassed by the opposition. The set pieces like corner kicks, passing, sliding tackles and dribbling can be practiced to perfection. Each player on the pitch has a unique combination of 4 attributes, namely Pace, Stamina, Accuracy and Aggression. As you progress you will need to adapt to to different types of players. You can play in a league consisting of 8 teams. The teams in the league are on the whole evenly matched but have different styles of play with players attribute to match that style. There is 12 different referees in the game.</desc>

		<name>Kick Off 2</name>
		<desc>The original Kick Off was expanded on in many ways for this sequel. The game now features full tournament modes (although the players on the teams are fictitious) and four different pitches (including an implementation of plastic pitches, whose uneven bounce cause controversy when several British clubs tried them in the 1980s).

Viewed top-down, the controls involve trapping the ball under your foot, giving you time to prepare passes. Running with the ball is tricky at first, as it doesn't stick to your foot the way it did in contemporary football games. Complex moves such as overhead kicks, back-heels and long-range through-ball passes can be completed with practice.</desc>

		<name>Killerball</name>
		<desc>In the dark future the new brutal sports game will be invented - Killerball - a blend of American Football, Roller-Skating, and Pinball. The three leagues (Elite, Major and Minor) will differ by the level of brutality. The action takes place in a circular rink. Each team of five players should put the iron ball in the small hole of the opposite team to make a score, and do not allow the players of another team to make the same. Each team player has health indicator, which will decrease during the game, because the only way to take the ball is to knock down the opponent in any brutal way. Each match during the season has time limit, but it may be finished also if all the players of any team will be unconscious and at least one ball will be put in the hole.

The game has a training mode, where you may play a single match with a computer or another human player, and tournament mode, where eight teams controlled either by computer or human players will fight for the victory. Tournament progress may be saved and restored.</desc>

		<desc>This is a vertical platformer with horizontal wrap-around. For the entertainment of the futuristic masses, you play a criminal that has been inserted into a mechanical body with the promise that if you succeed in surviving through all the levels (there are many and they are hard), you will be set free.
   You start each level at the bottom, near pooling liquid which will soon rise, at your immediate peril. Navigate the level from bottom to the exit at the top before the liquid rises and kills you. There are many other foes that fly around, causing you damage and basically annoying you to spit.
   Most levels must be navigated through a series of keyed gates, doors, or portals. These shaped keys are scattered around the map and must by picked up and used only on the gates they match individually.
   Twist: You can only carry one special weapon (triple shot, laser beam, or vertical shot) and one tool (key, liquid-freeze, or a red herring) at a time.
   This game requires a lot of memorization of enemy movement patterns and optimum routes.
   A unique feature is that when you die, you can watch a replay and take over at any point to continue your game.
   You can also hit the HELP button at the start of each level to view a map, helping you plan your route.</desc>

		<name>Laser Squad</name>
		<desc>Laser Squad is by the same designer as Microprose's classic X-Com: UFO Defense. It brings to the table an immersive gameplay environment as well as many innovative ideas that weren't available in any other game of the time.

In Laser Squad you control a group of "marine"-like soldiers (and the occasional cyborg). Before taking them into battle, you must buy them weapons and armour with a predetermined amount of credits, taking into account the individual abilities of your squad. Unlike X-COM, the soldiers do not gain experience over time.

There are 3 missions in turn - in The Assassins you must face down Sterner Regnix and his guards, Moonbase assault challenges you to destroy the OmniCorp database, and Rescue From the Mines eschews violence in favour of a rescue mission. These are viewed from above and progress in turns. Laser Squad also features a 2-player "hotseat"-type gaming option.</desc>

		<desc>A squad of four tough-guy soldiers have to take out some foes in a jungle. As the game starts, four soldiers are depicted, with any who are not present to play killed immediately - a joystick adaptor is required for 3 or 4 player games.

Leatherneck resembles Ikari Warriors - waves of soldiers move down the screen shooting at you, and you must shoot them before the bullets make contact. You are armed with grenades to take out mounted turrets, or kill a wide range of enemies at once, but watch out for enemy grenades. There are extra ammunition crates and improved weapons to pick up - waggle the joystick to toggle which one you are using.

Unusually, your shots are long-range and take effect instantly. You cannot change the direction you are facing, instead having the ability to strafe.</desc>

You were picked up by a royal merchant ship and brought to the king Darius. The people of Anar know the ancient legends, that tells about magical sword and shield, whose power alone is able to defeat Suzar. You and five other adventurers have volunteered to venture into the wilderness of Anar and to retrieve the magical items.

Legend of the Sword is a fantasy adventure game with slight RPG elements (top-down view, day and night cycle, world map exploration, traditional RPG plot, etc.). But the core gameplay is that of a pure puzzle-solving adventure. You interact with the environment by typing commands, and only a few of them are represented by icons (movement in eight directions as well as going in and out).</desc>

These creatures simply walk blindly through the world in the hope of reaching safety at the end of the level - unfortunately these levels include steep drops, gaps in the ground, barriers and rivers amongst other hazards.

You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.</desc>

When you load the game for the first time and personalise it with your name you'll see a house with several rooms like a kitchen, living room, bed room, etc. After some time of waiting a little person will appear and check out the house with all its rooms to see if he likes it. If he likes it, he will move in shortly and bring his dog along with him. That's where the real "game" starts and thats what it will be like every time you'll load the game from then. You see the house and the little person living in it, doing all kinds of stuff people do in their daily routine. He'll cook, eat, feed his dog, read newspapers, watch TV and from time to time he will write you a letter to let you know what he feels or what things he misses. To keep it more gamelike, you can "talk" to him in form of typing commands like "feed dog". You can also play cards with him and send him food or a present.
There is no aim in this game other than to interact with your LCP.</desc>

		<name>Lode Runner</name>
		<desc>The Bungeling Empire has stolen a huge cache of gold from its rightful owners, and your mission is to infiltrate its treasury and recapture it. This entails progressing through 150 screens of platforms, ladders and ropes.

The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.

This was one of the earliest games to include a level editor, allowing the creation of new level designs with no programming skill.</desc>

		<name>Loopz</name>
		<desc>A puzzle game where the main goal is to make loops! Random pieces are presented over a board, including simple lines and corners as well as S bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. It is up to the player to link them up in a loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.

Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.

Three play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style. 

Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score. and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.

The third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.</desc>

		<path>./Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge (1990)(Gremlin)[cr Replicants - ST Amigos].zip</path>
		<name>Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge</name>
		<desc>The first in a series of 3 racing games endorsed by the legendary car company, which is now a part of Proton.

The game features a total of 32 fictitious racetracks from around the world, split into 3 difficulty levels. There are 19 computer opponents (15 on the 8-bit versions) and you have to finish in the top 10 (top 8 on the 8-bits) to progress. The higher you finish in one race, the lower down the grid you start for the next race. The opposition drivers have pun names based on the F1 drivers of the day - examples include Ricardo Pastry and Crashhard Banger.

You can choose between sound effects or one of a variety of music pieces. The game features a simultaneous 2-player mode, but the 1-player mode only uses half the screen, a simple animation filling the other half. In most races you will have to make a pitstop for fuel in order to reach the finish. The tracks include features such as oil slicks, roadworks, boulders and rivers - contact with these (or the other cars) will slow you, but there is no car damage model.</desc>

		<desc>Licensed by the classic British car company, this game featured 2 modes of play - one has you racing against 19 computer rivals (with witty names such as Alain Phosphate and Crash-Hard Banger), and the other pits you against the clock.

There are 13 different types of races, ranging from Motorways to night-time to sections punctuated by roadworks, and some are lap-based with others being simple A-B. 2 players could play on a split screen mode.

The game's crowning glory, however, was the RECS editor, which allowed you to create courses of your own, with theoretically millions possible.</desc>

		<name>Lotus Turbo Challenge II</name>
		<desc>This sequel to Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge is again a behind-the-car viewed racing game. It takes in eight distinct circuits, adding surface and weather effects such as desert and snow. Later in the game, you must race through two-way motorways with oncoming traffic, (incorporating civilian cars and trucks), and face tough levels aided by speed and time boost pick-ups.

You are no longer racing directly against other cars or over laps; instead, racing is on time as you have limited time to reach each checkpoint.  Reaching each of these extends your time, and any remaining time is turned into bonus points if you successfully complete the track.

You have two cars at your disposal, which the game chooses automatically for each level, hence the loss of the word 'Esprit' from the title. The Lotus Esprit form the original is joined by a Lotus Elan convertible, which is slower but has better grip. 

You can play through the set of tracks either full-screen or in split-screen mode with another player. On Amiga and ST the game allows you to link two machines, each of which can have two human players. If one player successfully completes one of the 8 courses, all players can continue onto the next one.</desc>

You fly through a set of tunnels presented in a mixture of vectors and solid 3D, with arrows guiding you as to which way to go. The ship's damage is split into ten areas, and the auto-repair feature can be set to prioritise these. Energy resources are limited, and must be allocated across different areas of the ship.

Accurate steering and shooting are not enough – puzzles protect the route, and these will take some pondering. You are armed with multiple weapons (types of lasers, mines, a rear-gunning-droid and various guiding missiles), each of which has its own use. You also have an on-board map and radar, as well as a turbo facility.</desc>

During your journey, you will travel through four huge worlds where you will blow out a variety of enemies. But this game isn't yet another mindless shoot'em up -- there are a lot of clever surprises awaiting you too.

You can give more damage if you press the fire key longer. Further, your weapon changes its shape and features according to the requirements of each world.

One of the best features of Magic Pockets is the incredible athletic capabilities of the Bitmap Kid. You can jump really high by stepping on your whirlwinds, and can even destroy all the creatures you hit after falling down from a high place. These are no special features -- they are all your "normal" capabilities. In addition, you can drive a bike, dive, and even fly when you get special items. Best of all, there are a lot of those in the game.</desc>

Gameplay resembles titles such as Alien 8 and Sweevo's World. Some blocks can be pushed, some move after you shoot them, while some can be used for lifts.

There is even a story that a meteorite once crashed near the home nearly 20 years ago. More immediately, a girl named Sandy has gone missing from the local highschool and her boyfriend Dave swears that he saw Dr. Fred abducting her. Dave knows that he cannot do it alone and will need help from two other students if he has any hope of infiltrating the mansion and rescuing Sandy.

Players start by choosing 2 students to accompany Dave to the Edison mansion, and can then switch between these three characters at will. Most actions are carried out by selecting verbs on the screen and applying them to an object (such as "OPEN Door"). Each character maintains a separate personality and may have a different way to solve a problem from his classmates. Thus many of the puzzles can be overcome in different ways depending on the character being used. If any one of the kids are captured by the Edisons, they are thrown into the dungeon and must be rescued themselves by any character who still has their freedom.</desc>

		<desc>A port of the arcade game. The idea is deceptively simple: Guide a marble down a path without hitting any obstacles or straying off the course. The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, which makes it harder to stay focused on the direction the ball is to follow. There are tight corridors to follow and enemies to avoid. There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you're racing against the clock.</desc>

Ballblazer is a futuristic sport played in vehicles called "Rotofoils". The play field is a large rectangle made out of squares. The object of the game is to get a ball called "Plasmorb" into the goal, which moves along the edge of the play field. Otherwise, the rules are simple : "Three minutes, two players, one victor!"

The game is played in first-person on a split screen and can be played by either one or two players.

In addition to the original Ballblazer game, Masterblazer offers two new playing options: a Tournament Mode and a Rotofoil Race.</desc>

Other things to keep in mind are holes on the track which need to be jumped over and power ups which offer advantages when picked up, e.g. more speed. Permission to start at the next race is only given if the player finishes the race among the first three. Between races the car and its weapon system can be upgraded.</desc>

		<name>Mega Phoenix</name>
		<desc>Mega Phoenix brings the concept of the earlier arcade game Phoenix into the 90s, to the extent that a coin-op version was later made by Gaelco. The game is a single-screen shoot ‘em up in which the player moves left to right while shooting several waves. There is a shield function available, which lasts for a short period of time (after which it must recharge to be used again) and it paralyses the craft while active.

The first waves consist of several small alien beings in a set pattern, which move down from the fleet towards the player at random intervals- contacts with these kills the player. Deadly phoenixes firing at you come next, followed by the Mega Phoenix itself and then a final boss, before it all repeats with higher difficulty.</desc>

There's to be an election. Her legacy, a new economic order. Society is expected to be more self-reliant. But you should be well placed in this scheme of things.

Finding strategic placings is important, especially as you can't shoot while on water. Most of the time you are on foot, but at times you can hijack vehicles of shot foes. There are improved weapons, smart bombs and energy recharges to collect. Each of the 8 levels ends with a large vehicle requiring multiple shots to destroy.</desc>

		<desc>Metal Mutant is an action game, where you control the eponymous machine, sent to the planet Kronox to find and destroy the insane computer AROD 7. Each level is not side-scrolling fluidly, but is divided into separate screens; upon getting to the edge of one screen you move to the next one. 

The Metal Mutant has the ability to transform into 3 different forms: humanoid, dinosaur and tank. Each form has different capabilities. For instance, the humanoid form can jump and the tank can shoot missiles. You'll need to change form often depending on the situation, as most obstacles and enemies can be only beaten by a specific form. 

Throughout the game, apart from fighting enemies (and bosses), jumping, climbing and so on, you will find additional upgrades which will give you more abilities. You'll also encounter recharge station where you can regain health.</desc>

		<desc>A bomb has been set by terrorists to blow up a sky-scraping hotel in which the FBI’s Central Intelligence Unit is located, and you must diffuse it. 
Reaching the room itself is no easy task, as the hotel is split into segments of 8 floors, and you can’t move onto the next one without the emergency key, which the porter has hold of – he must be located. Each of these has one eighth of the secret stop code, and these must be entered in order to finally diffuse the bomb. Secrets can be gleaned from the opposing hijackers, and from the barman. In some cases furniture can be used to your advantage. 
The whole game is similar to Impossible Mission, requiring lots of logic, puzzle-solving and structured thought.</desc>

		<name>Narc</name>
		<desc>Narc is a 1-2 player game, where your mission is to infiltrate the Mr. Big Corporation, the scourge of the underworld. To do this, you must get through the game's eight stages, with over ten sectors like the junkyard, subway, drug lab, nursery, downtown, Sunset Strip, and even the corporation, where Mr. Big resides. In order to get through the stages, you are required to collect a number of safe cards, and insert them in the slot next to the stage exit.  Each sector includes a map, and should be easy to read. For example, the blue or red dots represent you, and the white dots are the missile launchers, while the "E" indicates the exit.

Your mission ain't going to be easy, as you will come face-to-face with enemies including the canine mutts, Das Lof Gang, Dr. Spike Rush, Joe Rockhead, Kinky Pinky, Sgt. Skyhigh, HQ Posse, and Mr. Big himself. You have two ways you can deal with them: either put a bullet in them or make arrests. Furthermore, they will try to blow you up the minute they see you. Fortunately, you're armed with a shotgun and missile launcher, but these both have a limited supply of ammunition. If your bullet counter reaches one, you can only fire one bullet at a time, so you need to find some more. Also, it is important not to waste all of your missiles: you might need them later when you deal with later enemies like Mr. Big. You are also backed up by a chopper and a mean shiny street machine.

More often than not, when you blow up enemies, you can pick up several items that they drop, including drugs, money, ammunition, missile launchers, and if you're lucky, safe cards.  Even if you got the safe card and can pass the level, you can keep blowing up enemies to score more points. According to the game, this game is for training purposes only, so you will not get employed by your local DEA office. Is this what the DEA does every day: go on rampages?</desc>

The loadout and starting positions are predefined, but you can change the loadout, choosing from two types of ammo, three types of rockets, explosives, first aid kits, transporters, and armor.

The game plays like a strategic third person shooter. You control the commander of the current squad, and can switch between the three. Also, there are computer terminals scattered around that can turn off some of the automated defenses and cameras.</desc>

		<desc>My name is McArra and I belong to the special pacification forces. My mission: find and destroy a nuclear submarine U-5544 that has unbalanced the forces between the two most powerful Earth armies. The name of the operation is Cephalopod and I have heard that you want to help me in this "easy" mission.

At first, we will be sent near the island where is anchored the submarine awaiting orders. We will swim to the coast, and once there... everything will depend on us.

"Navy Moves" is a one-dimensional side scrolling shooter, and the sequel of "Army Moves" and has the same gaming style.</desc>

		<name>Tower Toppler</name>
		<desc>You play a small green guy who needs to blow up eight towers, because their presence is somehow poisoning the water of planets which could potentially be ideal colonies. Unfortunately you need to get to the top of these towers to blow them up. 

You make your way up to the top of the tower via walkways around the outside of the towers. You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment. 

The game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect.

Towers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays out as a side-scrolling collect-'em-up in which bonus points can be obtained.</desc>

		<name>Neighbours</name>
		<desc>This racing game is set in the Ramsay Street universe of the Australian soap opera, which was hugely popular in the UK at the time. Nominally you play Scott Robinson, riding his skateboard in races against between one and four fellow characters – Mike Young on another skateboard, Charlene Ramsay in a go-kart, her brother Henry on a lawnmower, and Matt Robinson on a motorcycle. The eight races take in Ramsay Street, the Lassiter’s Complex, Erinsborough High School, and Anson’s Corner. There are three boards available (two on the Spectrum), trading top speed off against manoeuvrability.

Gameplay involves guiding your craft through a series of gates around a forced-perspective course. There are three levels of hazard presence available – hazards include kangaroos, emus and other (stereotypically Australian) animals, Bouncer the dog, grotty old Mrs. Mangel, and traffic bollards. Contact with any of these costs you time, and popularity (reflected by a Neighbours logo fading out along the bottom of the screen – collecting litter will restore this).</desc>

		<name>New Zealand Story, The</name>
		<desc>One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 

If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 

In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.</desc>

These levels are divided into four themes, and a few of them are played at night: Although it's hard enough to tell which way to go in the eight-way-scrolling maps during the day, you're sure to hit many barriers and walls at night when only your headlights give you any clues about where to go.

Depending on how well you raced, you'll get money to upgrade your car - and you'll also need to refuel your car! There are three types of cars to choose from, and depending on what kind of terrain a level is on, making the right choice here can give you the edge.</desc>

Your mission is to destroy the Ogre, or at least render it immobile, before it reaches and destroys your command post. The game based on a MicroGame with the same name created by Steve Jackson in 1977.

It's your job, as the player, not to control the tanks in real time, but to learn a programming language designed for the game to build an artificial intelligence that will allow the tank to survive. Omega includes a massive manual that needs to be read before tackling the game.</desc>

It all takes place in a post-apocalyptic universe in which a lot of money can be earned by transporting goods form place to place, but the large gangs of Overlanders who already do this are keen to stop you.

Two missions are on offer at a time, one tougher but more lucrative than the other, with half the money paid upfront and the other half on successful completion. Before setting off, you can buy upgrades such as turbo chargers, armour and enhanced weapons, each of which has a limited lifespan. Attacks from other vehicles can come either from guns or attempting ramming, and the roads are poorly-maintained and hazardous, so be careful, or better yet be violent first.</desc>

The main gameplay element consists of opening the so-called oxydstones. You can bump against a oxydstone and a colored symbol will appear. Uncover two of the same colors and they will stay open, making it a memory-like game. Open all oxydstones to solve a landscape.

To make things more interesting there are walls, pitfalls, quicksand, one-way walls, breakable tiles, reflecting lasers (for Deflektor-like puzzle solving), movable blocks (for Sokoban-like puzzle solving), tiles that crumble away when roll over them, doors, switches etc. Some of the landscapes contain items that you can pick up and use. Items include pieces of paper with hints, umbrellas that give you the ability to float, bombs to blow up walls, a spring to jump across gaps.

To mix up the gameplay, every tenth landscape is a meditation landscape where you simultaneously control several green orbs. Manoeuvre each of the orbs into a pit to solve these landscapes.</desc>

Now equipped with arms, face, and legs, Pac must guide a fairy back to her home in Fairy Land, but this task will not be easy because Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde, and Sue will pursue Pac-Man as he travels through Pac-Land. When he finally transports the fairy back to her home, Pac is given some magic shoes, which will help him get to his own home, where he will be greeted by his family: Ms. Pac-Man, Baby Pac-Man, Chomp Chomp, and Sourpuss. 

There are sixteen rounds to complete, with four trips each. During each round, he can grab a power pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use a springboard to jump over a lake. He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.</desc>

		<desc>Pang is a platform game which consists of 50 levels in total. It can be played with one or two players on the same screen, and the other player can join anytime within the game. 

Your goal is to destroy the balloons which bounce around the playfield. To accomplish this, you can shoot hooks which travel upwards, and blow up any balloon they touch. Depending on their size, they either split on two smaller ones, or evaporate if they're at their minimum size. Apart from balloons, some levels also have barriers that have to be destroyed with your hooks, since they often block your access to balloons. There are also some barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your character has the ability to climb ladders, but cannot jump. 

You can also pick up power-ups such as: the ability to fire two shots at once, the hook that attaches to the ceiling and waits 'til something bumps into it, a gun which has a high rate of fire but cannot destroy barriers. Beside extra weapons, you can also pick certain things like clock (halting time for a small period), dynamite (reducing all balls to minimum size, thus making you able to reach more points), life, and such.</desc>

Alien ships were bombarding the freighters with disorienting beams which drove the robots crazy. The human officers were eliminated, leaving the ships open for occupation by alien forces. At this point the players mission starts...

You control a cybernetic influence device (ID) which has been teleported aboard the first freighter to eliminate all the droids and robots. Two ways are possible to clean the ship decks representing the action part and the more strategy part of the game: Shooting (action) to destroy the robots or connecting itself into an other robot's brain (strategy) and take temporarily control of it.

It's possible to play the game as a simple shoot-em-up game, but the main part of Paradroid 90 is the transfer game to take control of other droids.</desc>

		<desc>The game showcases the African part of the 12th Paris-Dakar rally route. Starting in Tripoli (Lybie), the player races against computer drivers on six stages. The road is marked by rocks on its sides on most stages, and the player should keep his car on the road. If the player misses a road, he has a limited amount of time to find it again, otherwise he will be penalized. On the second and fourth stages there is no road from the start, and the player must reach the finish on his own. The off-road environment is full of rocks, animal corpses, and other debris. The player should not damage the car too much, otherwise he will be penalized as well. There are three difficulty levels to select from before the start of rally.</desc>

There are four difficulty levels to select the skill of the computer controlled player. One or two players may play but always against the computer. In a two player game, both players play as a doubles team.

The game starts off looking behind the player as the style of serve is chosen (top spin, curve, etc) and then it switches to a top down view for the rally.</desc>

The Roobikyoub dwarves have been banished from the kingdom, which is not good as they produce high-quality whisky. King Erik is not popular for this decision, as some feel that ale brewers and mineral water bottlers have influenced him. Honest John the trader and Kronos the Magician play a key role in your journey, each offering sub-quests to attempt.

The package includes a novella complete with map and decipherable hints, which are accessed by typing 'hint' followed by the code into the computer. Therefore, those with only a pirated copy would struggle to complete the game.

Your score and the number of locations visited are both displayed in the title bar. The parser allows whole words to be deleted and unaccepted previous entries to be re-edited.</desc>

		<name>Peter Beardsley's International Football</name>
		<desc>Licensed around former England player Peter Beardsley, this football (soccer) game is viewed side-on. The only playing option is the European Championship tournament of the day, although you can choose the 8 teams from the 26 major European footballing nations of the time (so the USSR, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia are all still complete). Two players can compete in these groups, but there's no guarantee of getting straight to a 2-player game, especially as tournaments (and individual matches) can't be quit out of.

The gameplay features variable strength kicks, determined by how long you hold the fire button for. In a break with realistic physics, the ball ricochets back in the direction it came from. Goalkeepers stay on the goal-line rather than using the whole penalty box.</desc>

The game is a sidescrolling adventure and takes mostly place in the house of the employer. Pink Panther can himself move freely in the house, but at the same time, he needs to keep his eye on the sleepwalker, so that he can prevent him from stumbling on various objects, such as rugs and tables.

Before each level, you can purchase different kinds of objects from a store. These items can be used to gently lure the sleeping man into the right path.</desc>

This game lets you choose from 6 different "ages" (for example, "The Silver Empire" from 1560-1600, "War For Profit" from 1640-1660, etc.), one of 4 nationalities (English, French, Dutch, Spanish), 4 difficulty levels, and one of 5 special abilities (skill at fencing, skill at navigation, etc.). Nine different types of ships were represented. 

The goal of the game is to retire with as much gold and land as possible, as many ranks/titles as possible (Colonel, Admiral, Marquis, Duke), and a wife. Finding long lost relatives helps too. You accomplish these goals by plundering cities, capturing and sinking enemy ships, getting in good with governors to receive titles, learn news of "evil Spaniards" holding your relatives, capturing evil pirates, etc.  

The game is educational, as you will learn about piracy through the thoroughly researched manual. You'll smell the sea salt as you participate in wild sword fights, desperate sea battles, and daring attacks by land!</desc>

		<name>Platoon</name>
		<desc>The film Platoon featured a squad of five soldiers on their mission for the US Army in Vietnam. In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them.

The game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.

The next section is in first-person 3D, as you move through a network of tunnels in search of flares and a compass. There are 3 distinct control methods, changing from the standard motion when an enemy appears (this puts you in control of a cross-hair for more accurate targeting), and when you enter a room to search.

After escaping this you settle in a bunker overnight, and have a limited amount of flares with which to locate incoming enemy, and must then shoot them before they can shoot you. The jungle airstrike from the film is the next moment - you have two minutes to rush into a safe position to the north, using your compass for guidance.

Finally you face the treacherous Sergeant Barnes, and must hit him with grenades 5 times whilst trapped in a foxhole to prevent him wiping you out.</desc>

		<desc>Plutos is a vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up featuring a succession of waves, containing what's reputed to be the first simultaneous 2-player mode on the ST or Amiga. Many of the enemies you face are waves of laser fodder with movement patterns taking them around the screen, with gun turrets and firing enemies as well, to fight or avoid. You start with 4 lives, and get an extra one (and a 5000 point bonus) after every level.

In many similar shoot 'em ups, you have unlimited fuel but must pick up ammunition recharges or increased powerups. Plutos lacks weapon upgrades, but rather inventively forces you to refuel, by shooting at posts which contain fuel (there are also bays for 500 bonus points marked out). Each level finishes with an enemy with eyes shooting at you, and from level 3 there are teeth mounted in front which fire at you.</desc>

		<desc>Strange happenings are afoot once again in Sweethaven and only Popeye can make it right. In Popeye 2, our spinach lovin' hero must once again rescue Olive Oyl and make mincemeat of Bluto while looking after Swee'Pea, feeding Wimpy and keeping an eye on Jeep.

Popeye has four different levels to traverse through. His initial adventure takes him to a construction site where bouncing springs, falling girders and open welding flames impede his progress. Rolling barrels, and bombs which must be touched to be put out also stand to cause harm. In every level scattered hamburgers must be collected in order for Popeye to get past Wimpy who is often hanging out somewhere near the top of every vertically scrolling platform level. There are also feats of strength that Popeye must perform by beating up a punching robot-type thing with the aid of Spinach. Once past all these obstacles Popeye can move on to the next level.

The second level takes Popeye into the urban jungle where he must climb the side of the Biff Spinach building and avoid the same obstacles as in the previous levels. In the third level falling girders are replaced with giant bananas as Popeye finds himself in a jungle. Coconut throwing monkeys hang from ledges and snoozing tigers and snakes decorate the trees. The fourth and final level of the game finds Popeye climbing the masts of the S.S. Trev and the S.S. Andy as he makes his way to a final confrontation with Bluto and rescue Olive Oyl.

Popeye is able to jump around and occasionally when the situation calls for it punch his way through this vertical platformer. Bonus points are rewarded for finding Swee'Pea and Jeep. He can take multiple hits before he takes a curtain call but thankfully is unharmed by long drops. The player should beware as Popeye has only one life to get through the four levels of this adventure.</desc>

		<name>Populous</name>
		<desc>You play a god, gaming against other gods in a celestial game of conquest.  To win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the vermin who worship that other god.

Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness.  Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not.  To get win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on.  The more followers you have you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same.

When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero.  He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy.  When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people.  He will burn; he will kill.  And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.

But you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the god's have other tools as well.  You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers.  Submerge their towns in swamps. Raise a volcano in the middle of their best farmland.  Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who didn't build on high-ground. 

And when you win, you'll have 500 more worlds to conquer.  A god's play is just never done.</desc>

		<name>Powerdrome</name>
		<desc>The Powerdrome racing series is now into its 24th year of high-speed high-octane action. Why race on flat 2D circuits when you can charge through a multi-textured half-pipe in small aircraft? Typhoon Racing have taken up the challenge, and entered you in their machine.

There are 6 different circuits, with hazards including chicanes, tunnels and crusher gates. Shading to the sections marks out whether a corner or dive is coming up. There are 5 computer opponents to race against in one player mode, while a data link cable allows 2-player games.

Each planet has its own atmosphere, and your machine's filters will need to be set to take account of this. Rain on some circuits necessitates a pitstop for a changeover. You are armed with afterburners, which can provide a speed use in open air but should not be overused. The Amiga version allows you to adjust the sensitivity of the controls - either way, joystick is easier to use but mouse is seen as ultimately being faster.</desc>

The game is not a faithfully conversion of the movie however - your unit has already been killed off when the game starts and you will battle scorpions, enemy soldiers and dodge obstacles etc, before facing the Predator itself a number of times.

The game is a fairly standard run-jump-shoot platformer, except that you start with no weapons at all and must collect them as the game goes on.</desc>

		<desc>Prehistorik is a side-view platform game with superficial similarity to Chuck Rock, although the games were developed simultaneously in different countries. You control a neanderthal who must march through hostile pre-historic environments seeking food and keeping himself safe. Some food can be found in caves, but it mainly exists in living animal forms.

These include fire-breathing Pyro-Tax dragons, the Turtosaurus, and the Bad Bat. Each of these must be clubbed to death, some taking up to 5 hits, and then walked over. Some other enemies are indestructible, with the monkeys who throw coconuts at you particularly fiendish.

You will have to complete the level within the time limit, and avoid contact with these foes. However, bombs and improved weapons can be collected, as can extra lives, time bonuses and an improved jump.</desc>

		<desc>The Grand Vizier Jaffar has thrown you into a dark dungeon and plans to marry the girl of your dreams in an hour. You're not going to let that happen are you? Try to escape from the dungeon, take out Jaffar's guards, find your way through the Sultan's palace and defeat Jaffar himself. Now go, you've got 60 minutes!

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.

The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.</desc>

		<name>Pro Powerboat Simulator</name>
		<desc>If this 'simulator' is to be believed, powerboat racing is a chaotic race across a number of largely one-directional tracks with fjords and inlets forcing you down one of two lanes, and sections where a bridge needs to be cleared by hitting a ramp at the right speed beforehand (as you jump over these, you can land so as to skim off other boats). Your boat is fitted with bombs, which can be placed so as to force the other boats to run over them, gaining you points. Extra bombs and fuel litter the course, often close to the banks, which you must avoid contact with, for fear of crashing your boat. When this happens you are forced into the next one, which is, as if by magic, available at a convenient point just beforehand. A helicopter flies overhead, dropping bombs which you must avoid, and often obscuring your view. The other boats often crowd together attempting to force you into the wall.

As with all the Codemasters budget titles, realism goes out of the window, with an emphasis on simple instantaneous action.</desc>

		<name>Prohibition</name>
		<desc>Prohibition is a shoot'em up taking place in New York in 1930. The town is overrun by gangsters and you're hired by the police to rid the town of them.

The gameplay is simple: you're facing a row of buildings, a gangster pops up and you have to shoot him before the on-screen timer goes empty and he shoots you first. You can hide until the timer restarts but this is limited too. 
At the end of each stage is a bonus round where you have to shoot gangsters in a room, with no more ability to hide and a faster timer.
As you progress through each stage, the game will become faster, and enemies will become harder to find and to hit.
Of course, your goal is to reach the end of the game with the highest possible score.</desc>

		<name>Projectyle</name>
		<desc>Projectyle is a single or multiplayer (1 to 3 players) hockey-type sports game of the future. It features smooth-scrolling, frantic action, colorful graphics and digital music.

A total of five goal rooms, arranged in the shape of a cross, are connected with tunnels. The camera smoothly follows the puck/ball (the "projectyle") and scrolls to the adjacent rooms when entering one of the connecting tunnels. Each player, whether computer-controlled or not, has a room in which his own goal is located (their "defense" zone.) A fourth room -- the Frantic Zone -- contains a goalmouth for each player, while the central room, where action begins, allows access to the four other rooms.

The object of the game is for each player to protect their own goal while trying to bring the puck/ball into the other players' rooms to score a goal. Bonuses appear randomly in the rooms, allowing the player who passes on them to gain some benefits, such as freezing the other players for a few seconds, gaining extra stamina, or sealing exits.

The game supports up to 3 player simultaneous quick action single game play, and can support up to 8 players in leagues of varying lengths.  League/tournament play supports player/team management, including training, injuries and position reassignment.</desc>

		<desc>You are a psyborg named Duncan Norton, who must travel through the vortex from a space vessel trapped in a galaxy very far from Earth. An alien race is threatening to take over 38 planets and you've got to stop them. 

Starting from Anacreon, you will mentally pass through the Krypton, Kalgan, Zorgon, Terminus, Trantor, and finally Sol systems. Each stellar system has a certain number of planets, which you will traverse from one to another. 

The game is a first-person virtual reality race, where you run as fast as possible on the tiles that are formed in a pentagonal prism. At the starting point you accelerate, and then change the facets of the prism in order to avoid falling through the gaps. When the tile's path  spirals, you may decelerate your velocity. Time runs out, and you must refill your time meter by standing on tiles marked with a "T". Standing on certain tiles that are marked with shapes of different blinking colors will give you a different amount of points. Special actions, such as jumping from one part of prism to another as well as teleporting forward and back, may be performed. Save points are placed on the track but the number of prism facets may change during your run.

Finishing the race to each planet will give you a password, which may be used later to start from this point. The best scores will be written in High Scores table.

The game is available for 1 or 2 players.</desc>

Puffy's Saga is an overhead view maze game that represents a cutesy variant of Gauntlet. Each of the 20 levels has a quota of dots to eat before the level is completed. These levels are inhabited by foes who surround you and reduce your energy on contact. Meat restores 100 energy points each time - this total can go beyond its starting level of 500. You are armed with a gun, which not only kills foes but also turns many of them into edible energy-giving snacks.

Keys must be collected and used to open doors. Magic Goms allow you to use a map or a fire-bolt. Other available bonuses include invincibility periods and teleporting.</desc>

However, if The Punisher can raise $500,000, he can pay off an informant for the location of the biggest criminal in Manhattan, The Kingpin.  Working with a time limit and financed by The Trust, The Punisher only has a short time to complete enough missions to raise that much money.

The Punisher primarily plays from a top-down perspective, where the player moves The Punisher through the streets and alleys of New York, entering buildings and taking out enemies with a range of weaponry.  The Punisher also drives to locations in his Battle Van, where the player controls the van from a first-person perspective, to the mission’s address.  The Punisher also has a scrolling mode when The Punisher scuba dives and knifes underwater assailants on the way to boats.</desc>

You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.

There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)

The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.</desc>

		<name>Quadralien</name>
		<desc>Quadralien is a real-time puzzle game in the tradition of Sokoban.

The future: Mankind's space stations throughout the solar system are powered by a huge space reactor, called Astra. Astra is about to break down. The enemy race of Quadraliens has captured the reactor; now, contamination is rising and total failure is imminent. The last chance are six remotely controlled droids, which are to clean Astra and destroy the Quadrailen mother in Astras core.

You're controlling two robots in each of the 19 levels, cleaning up the contamination on your way. Gameplay is a variation of Sokoban: You've got to push spheres in the right direction to clear the way. However, the spheres are magnetically charged, meaning that they repell or attract each other. You've got to consider chain reactions. 

Before entering a level, you may chose which robots to take with you. Each droid has different abilities, like higher range of movement, higher capacity to carry contaminated materials, or a magnetic charge of its own.  You can blast your way out of hopeless situations with a limited number of detonators, and you may restart every level with already removed contamination staying removed. However, there's a time limit for the whole game in form of reactor core temperature and energy, so be quick!</desc>

		<name>Quartz</name>
		<desc>Quartz is a shoot 'em up with a variety of sections. The first section (and every odd-numbered one) is viewed from above and scrolls in every direction. As well as standard attack waves, there are large red/blue/yellow balls which split on impact a lá Asteroids, and once the smallest ones are destroyed they release tokens. Once you have collected 9 of each, you can choose a power-up form a range including various weapons, restart points (which effectively gives infinite continues when used with an emulator's 'snapshot' feature) and repairs to the ship. Destroying the whole of standard waves gives combined tokens which add one to each of the three colours.

The even-numbered waves scroll in a single direction, but include waves coming at you from other directions, even from within the screen in 3D. You can have up to 3 power-ups stored on your ship at a time, and choose one to activate by pressing F1-F3 - they all have limited firepower. Unusually, when you have no lives left, death results not in game over, but the loss of one of your power-ups (chosen by you).</desc>

On 15 levels from one to another you should eliminate the maintenance of certain kind placed on the asteroids of different forms, which complexity is increased with level's number. Hostile space crafts as attack you as want to collide with you as kamikaze. You may shoot them with a weapon and move in four directions on the screen to avoid them or their shots. 

Between the levels to acquire a bonus you (without ability to shoot) should break through different arcade sequences such as fly through the series of small asteroids, or enemy space jets, or acquire the bullets or enhanced weapon avoiding the collisions. 

Each collision means decrease of your available space jets, which quantity may increase with the score. Also the amount of bullets for each your space jets on each level is limited so shoot wisely. 

Finishing the game you may be enlisted in High Score table.</desc>

		<desc>Rambo's mission is set deep in Afghanistan, in the days when the Soviets occupied it, and America was putting this right (we won't mention who they enlisted to do so). Colonel Trautman has been kidnapped by the Soviets, and you've gone in there to rescuing him. Doing so is a three-part operation approximately following the plot of the film.

In the first part, you explore the building Trautman could be in, through a top-down view of the building. It is heavily protected by infra-red security beams, which when activated unleadsh the enemies. The locations of the beams are only apparent if you collect the special goggles. Other hazards include mines, trapdoors and booby-trapped doors, but there are enhanced weapons to collect.

Section two is identical to the first, except that it is located outside, the enemy are onto you from the start, and there are no traps. The final section changes to an Operation Wolf-style shoot 'em up, with a horde of tanks, foot soldiers and helicopters to face. Your gun can jam, which adds to the challenge of finally getting out alive.</desc>

		<name>Ranarama</name>
		<desc>The purpose of apprentice courses is for young people to learn a trade gradually, without putting yourself or your employers at risk. Unfortunately, nobody explained this to Wizard’s apprentice Mervyn, before he tried to cast a spell to make him irresistible to females, as the spell misfired, and made him attractive only to female frogs. However, his dungeon was soon invaded, and Mervyn was not killed, as he appeared to be a humble frog.

Viewed from above, the aim is to kill all 96 of the wizards who have invaded the dungeon, which is split into 8 levels, each made up of 16 screens and at least 50 rooms. To see what’s in a room he has to enter it, in a manner similar to the Switchblade games.

The game’s rather esoteric title comes from the way you obtain spells to upgrade the four different types of power you have (power, offence, defence and effect). When you meet a warlock you enter a mini game in which the letters RANARAMA are in random order, and by swapping pairs of letters in sequence you must form the full word in as little time as possible. This system of having a sub-game for collecting upgrades is similar to the ‘grappling’ concept in Paradroid.

This earns up to four of the Runes (Mysticism, Witchcraft, Magecraft and Runecraft), each of which can be used on one of the four types of power. The Magecraft offensive use is a fireball, defence for Runecraft makes you invisible to enemies, and the special effect for Witchcraft allows you to jump through space. Lose a life and you lose all these powers, and losing another life means it’s Game Over.</desc>

At the same time numerous robots have to be destroyed but while doing so it's important to avoid killing the humans by mistake. Each level has its own quota of humans that have to be saved within a time limit. There are numerous robots with differences in pace, armour and weapons. Some power ups can be picked up such as shields, extra lives, invisibility and various new weaponry like rockets. At some locations there are fences that have to be destroyed and doors that have to be unlocked. There are also trap doors that have to be avoided.</desc>

		<name>Red Heat</name>
		<desc>Red Heat is based on the Walter Hill film of the same name, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Belushi. You take control of Soviet detective Ivan Danko (played by Schwarzenegger), who travels to Chicago in pursuit of the fearsome Georgian drug lord Victor Rosta. 

The game is essentially a side-scrolling beat'em up in the vein of Vigilante. As Danko, you proceed across four levels which follow the movie's original setting, where you are constantly attacked by members of the Cleanheads, a group of drug-dealers who are in business with Victor Rosta. To eliminate hostiles you can either punch them (slow but long-ranged) or head-butt them (close-ranged but faster). The only defensive move available is crouching, so as to avoid being hit - there is no jumping or any other evasive tactics. Occasionally, you can get hold of a handgun and fire six shots at the villains. Other items you can pick up will boost your health, make you temporarily invulnerable or give you access to bonus levels.

One peculiarity of Red Heat is its widescreen-like game area, and the fact that all characters are drawn from the waist up. This may find partial explanation in the first level, set in a Russian sauna where, as in the original movie scene, all characters are not wearing clothes.</desc>

And the only way NATO can prevent that from happening is to reinforce their forces with convoys from the US and other countries. 

You are in command of one of the US attack submarines. You must hold the ocean against the Soviet navy at all costs, or the land battle will go badly. Part submarine simulator, part dynamic campaign, and part WW3 simulation, Red Storm Rising is an amazing look at modern warfare.</desc>

		<name>Rick Dangerous</name>
		<desc>You play Rick Dangerous, an Indiana Jones type who's on a quest to find the lost Coolu Amazon tribe.  However, his plane crashes in the middle of a bunch of crazed Coolus. Hopefully he's up to the challenge of escaping. If he is, he will find himself in the pyramid of Egypt with no easy way past leaders and their minions, and then engulfed in a web of traps in a Nazi base.

Rick Dangerous is a platform game across over 100 screens, in which Rick has his gun in one hand, and dynamite sticks in another. You must take a methodical approach to clearing each screen, as there are traps in place which will need memorizing and preempting where possible. Use the dynamite wisely, for enemies you can't get into the purely-horizontal range of your gun.</desc>

		<desc>Unusually for Electronic Arts in the early 90s, this was a platform -shooter game with little or no adventuring or strategy elements. The game scrolls sideways, and has sections where precision jumps are required, either to clear rivers or collect bonuses. You carry a dagger to deal with the enemies, and must avoid contact with them. When killed, they leave coins to be collected - these are spent in the shop sections. Death loses you most of your coins, but they can usually be retrieved if they land on solid ground - making it better to be killed in combat than by drowning.</desc>

		<desc>RoadBlasters is a futuristic racing action game. The goal is to reach the finish line in one piece throughout each of 50 levels. Numerous enemies are out on the road to try and stop you, including armored cars, motorcycles, canons on the side of the road, landmines, and more. 

Your vehicle is equipped with a machine gun to help you out, and occasionally a weapons plane will fly in and drop additional power ups that can be collected. Some of these are the U.Z. canon, cruise missiles, and speed boost. Your car has a very limited amount of fuel, however more can be picked up along the way by crossing the halfway point of a level, or by collecting the red and green fuel spheres that appear in the road or after destroying certain enemies.  On many levels collecting fuel is critical otherwise you won't be able to reach the finish line.</desc>

You always play against another droid, who can be treated as friend or foe - pushing them into the gap at the side you've just created is a particularly neat trick, especially when playing a human opponent.

You are armed with a laser gun, which can be directed seperately from your main direction of motion. The roads include a range of hazards, including barriers and spikes, although bonus weaponry and a speed-up can be gained. Contact with these (or your opponent) will gradually drain your shields, and once these are gone you have little chance of surviving for long.</desc>

The major corporation there, Omni Consumer Products (OCP) saw an opportunity to sell a new kind of law enforcement officer to the troubled city. They took what was left of Murphy, encased it in titanium armor, wiped his memory and created RoboCop. Now it's up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence might not be the kingpin of this town...

Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, RoboCop allows the player to control RoboCop. The majority of the game is a side scroller. RoboCop can punch unarmed citizens and shoot armed citizens. He can move left, right and duck but can not jump. Different weapons can be picked up from enemies, and power-ups to restore health and/or energy. Following levels, RoboCop will have to match a criminal's face to the proper mugshot and engage in a first-person shooting bonus round.</desc>

However, in the 21st Century time travel has been mastered, as have jet-propulsion backpacks, plus some cataclysmic weaponry and advanced code-breaking equipment. Thus, you are sent back in time to change the result of the war using this technology to find their five rocket factories and destroy the moon base.

The game fits the Cinemaware template closely, with a string of action sequences linked by cinematic animation sequences to set the scene. There's also a strategic element, as you move your spies around to gain information and avoid detection, and decide how much Lunarium to use at each stage of the game. Action sequences include hand-to-hand combat with a Nazi guard, and flying through the air shooting either hordes of enemy planes or the Zeppelin itself.</desc>

ROCKFORD has been developed by ARCADIA SYSTEMS for their Coin-op Arcade cabinets. This version brings all that arcade action and quality into your Home!
There are four levels on each of five different worlds with four screens on each level. It all adds up to eighty totally different playing screens. Take up the challenge as you guide ROCKFORD through the puzzles and take on the role of cowboy, spaceman, doctor, chef and hunter.
We have also packed in digitized sound effects and music, as well as special animated sequences depicting your success, failure and demise. All this detail, and the fiendishness of the brand new puzzles, really does make ROCKFORD the ultimate challenge for your computer.</desc>

		<name>Rockstar Ate my Hamster</name>
		<desc>You are Cecil Pitt, a wannabe rock star manager. You must choose from 1-4 rock stars (with names such as Tina Turnoff and Wacko Jacko) to manage by viewing their audition tapes. Once you chosen your artists you then have to choose what kind of gear to get them - spanking new, second hand or dodgy. The dodgy gear is dirt cheap but you might pay for your choice later on in the game.

To make your group a star, you have options such as practicing, publicity stunts, and buying gifts for your stars. Each action you choose advances the calendar by one day and you have until December to achieve your ultimate aim of superstardom - represented by a line graph which rises or falls depending on the performance of your band's releases.

Once your band has recorded their first album you can choose to release the single and/or the album. The single needs a video to go with it which costs varying amounts of cash depending on which director you choose. You can choose to go for publicity, but this can be risky as there is a chance that one of your rock stars will be in the papers as an ex-rock star who died in any of many strange ways (all that's missing is a 'bizarre gardening accident'). Publicity affects your sales directly and also affects the crowds who attend your gigs. You lose the game if either you run out of money, or all of your rock stars die.</desc>

The roller coaster follows its natural path, swinging from side to side and up and down, while you aim a turret at the targets and shoot them out. After completing its cycle, the roller coaster reverses, moving through the same area moving backwards. A co-operative two player mode exists, in which each player controls a crosshair.

		<path>./Rotor (1989)(Arcana)[!].zip</path>
		<name>Rotor</name>
		<desc>You control a battle tank (the Rotor) which hovers in a 2D-labyrinth. Gravity pulls heavily on the Rotor, making it fall towards the ground. As any contact with walls or enemies is deadly, your main task is to avoid that. You may rotate your tank freely and accelerate via an afterburner, thus manoeuvring through the corridors -- imagine a mix of Asteroids and Lunar Lander to get an idea of the physics.

Scattered throughout the 18 different fortresses are boxes. Shoot these open to find either a) Fuel: this will replenish your supply, which is drained by shooting and accelerating. b) Sun crystals: Collect all to finish the mission. c) Bombs. They will explode in 30 to 60 seconds, destroying your ship. You can avoid that by leaving the screen quickly, or by picking the bomb up; this earns you major credits, but your ship drops much faster due to increased weight. d) Pearls. Collecting these advance the upgrade counter by one to three steps; you may activate the current upgrade at any time, which will improve your rotation speed, engine strength, weapon, shield etc. Boxes are emptied by carefully flying very, very close to them and activating a tractor field.

As if gravity and accurate flying wasn't challenging enough, the game also confronts you with various enemies. All of these are immobile and fire in a straight line; the sheer mass of them makes avoiding the bullets a difficult task nevertheless. Apart from turrets, there are attractors and repulsors who'll smash you into walls, and force fields that need to be deactivated by finding and shooting a switch.

The tricky labyrinths together with the short supply of fuel, weight constraints and clever upgrade system make Rotor more a game of tactics and accuracy than arcade action. Wild shooting and careless flying will deplete your fuel in no time; you'll have to progress carefully to discern traps in time.</desc>

As with so many Dinamic games, the two parts are loaded separately, but the second can't be accessed until a password (provided at the end of part one) is input.

Contact with the enemies en route (which are mostly mutant demons) drains your limited energy, and you are also working against a time limit on each section. As well as your magical powers (which are stronger in part two), you can collect swords to attack, as well as lightning bolts which can be collected to destroy all enemies on screen. In part two vanquished foes release coins, which can be spent at shop sections on rechargers, shields and teleporters amongst other things.</desc>

Now you have returned as a ghost, with psychic powers in place of your physical ones. Starting out at your own funeral, you must follow conversations to find clues. One early task is to find items which boost your physical abilities. You have help from other deceased beings, starting with pub owner Joe Danby.

Scapeghost was Level 9's final adventure game, and it is in the same format as the existing ones, which makes for a text parser with additional graphics. Puzzles require instructions to be given to other characters. The game is split into 3 days, each of which can be played independently of each other - November Graveyard, Haunted House and Poltergeist.</desc>

		<name>Scrabble</name>
		<desc>Scrabble is a licensed version of the popular Spear's  game developed by U.S. Gold Ltd. 

Scrabble is a word game for 2 - 4 players. 
It is played by forming inter-locking words, cross-word style, on a Scrabble playing board. The Scrabble board is a grid on which there are bonus squares, playing a letter on one of these squares doubles or triples the score for either the letter or the entire word.
Players have seven letters, or tiles, each and at the end of each turn they take new letters from a pile, unseen, to replace the letters used. 

This game has the following features ;

1. multi-player game
 2, 3, or 4 players can play the game together. Players can be human or computer controlled.
2. sound effects and music
3. a practice mode
This mode of play enables the following features, 

1. no time limit,
4. a hint mode where the game shows the best move with the letters at the players disposal,
5. an advice feature which, after the player has taken their turn, shows how many higher scoring moves could have been made, 
6. the option to see what tiles remain unplayed,
7. a peek facility that allows the player to see other player's tiles
8. if an illegal word is played it will not be allowed but the player will not lose their turn,

a competition mode
In this mode each player has 25 minutes in which to play all of their game moves and for each minute over that limit the player is fined 10 points
The 'hint' and 'advice' features of the practice session are not available and the 'unused letters' option will show only the number of letters and not a full breakdown of the tiles remaining. If it is the players move ten the timer cannot be stopped, and the game cannot be saved and re-loaded.
Only game scores achieved in competition mode will be entered into the 'Top Scores' table.

This game is based on the Chambers English Dictionary and the Official Scrabble Words books current at the time of release</desc>

		<desc>Seymour goes to Hollywood to star in his first motion picture. As he arrives in his limousine, he soon discovers that the Dirk, the studio manager, has disappeared in Miami. Seymour must start production of his film by himself.

Seymour Goes To Hollywood is a platform adventure, another Dizzy clone, this time replacing the egg character with an amorphous blob of unknown origin. Like in the Dizzy games, the main objective is to collect everything that isn't nailed down (using the fire button) to solve puzzles. In the upper left portion of the screen sits an inventory with three slots and besides that the score points and the energy bar. Seymour loses energy when touching dangerous objects and hazardous environments. When the bar gets empty, Seymour transforms into a pile of bones and the player loses one life. The game starts with three lives (shown as clack boards under the energy bar) and no way of saving progress.</desc>

		<name>Shadow Dancer</name>
		<desc>Shadow Dancer is a one-player game in which you control Shinobi. With the help of your dog, you must kill your enemies while you venture through locations such as airports, railroads, waterfalls, sewers, and more.  Furthermore, you must find and disarm several bombs along the way before you leave each. You also have the option of using magic against enemies, which may consist of tornadoes or fireballs.

There are five missions you must complete; and each one has different objectives such as obstructing the enemies deadly mission, disrupting the enemy's supply route, raiding the enemy's industrial units, attacking the enemy's underground forces, and liberating and securing the shuttle's base. Each mission consists of three stages and there is a boss on each of the mission's final stages. 

What's good about the dog, you say? Well, if you tell it to, the dog will maul enemies (provided that the dog barks at them when you face them) and distract them long enough so that you can shoot at them. Remember that you have a limited time to do this, as the enemy will eventually kick the dog off him. This causes the dog to yelp and shrink, making him powerless against them.</desc>

		<desc>In this sequel to Shadowlands, you find yourself commanding a team of explorers through a deserted space-station, trying to discover what happened to the crew. Along the way you must solve puzzles, fight baddies and do masses and masses of exploring.

You have four characters to control in this real time RPG, and the designers have done their best to remove all the numbers usually involved in RPG's (dexterity/wisdom etc) and replaced them with friendlier looking graphical bars. Another good idea is the way you can put your characters in formation instead of having to move them one at a time. The other big innovative game system is the clever use of light: Teque's "Photoscaping" system which means you can only see a few feet in front of you and you can use flares and torches to light up areas.</desc>

		<desc>Shanghai is a tile-based game based on the ancient Chinese game of Mah-Jong - this was the first of many computer versions.

The gameplay involves 144 tiles, each depicting different images, which have to be removed by matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the centre. A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side.

This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on, as well as featuring 5 preset challenges, some of which have time limits of 5 or 10 minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.</desc>

Each level must be completed within a time limit, but progressing from left to right. She is armed with a whip, a useful weapon for attacking the denizens of dinosaurs on each level. Lots of bonus items can also be whipped to activate them - bonus lives and extra time for example. Tokens to turn into a fox can also be collected - enough of these takes you into a bonus level set underground.</desc>

		<desc>Sherman M4 is a 3D tank simulator. It is set in World War II and includes 3 campaigns; Normandy, Ardennes and Desert. You have up to four M4s, two jeeps and artillery support to complete each mission. The Germans have four different kinds of tanks, bunkers etc. Objectives include destroying bridges, capturing towns, rescuing jeeps and destroying convoys. You can drive one tank at a time and give the others movement orders on a map. They will automatically attack enemies they encounter. The map is also used for moving jeeps and calling artillery strikes. Your tanks can be repaired, refueled and rearmed if you capture hangers in some missions. Before each mission you can alter several realism options as well as the enemy moral, experience and commander.</desc>

Each level is broken down into smaller scenes and hostages are guarded by big blokes who throw swords. Watch out for gun-toting enemy henchmen and ninjas.

Reaching the end of each level will find you battling it out with a boss. These range from 8ft giants to helicopter gunships.</desc>

You get a chance to match your skills at this Air Hockey style game, over 'Cantina Band' inspired music. Deflect the puck around the walled area using your bat, trying to knock it into your opponent's goal.

There are several competitors, from which some of them definitely cheat, so be prepared to be laughed at. However, you can cheat as well, as you can resize your stick to fill the whole table width, or add one in the middle, and see who breaks glass first. There are single plays or the tournament where you play opponents in order of difficulty. The winner is the one who reaches 15 glassbreaks first.</desc>

		<desc>Originating in the arcades, Side Arms is a horizontally scrolling shoot ‘em up in which you control Lieutenant Henry (a second player can control Sergeant Sanders in some versions), armed with crude weaponry and protective jump-suits. They must save the earth from the mercenary invaders of Bozon. You must first reach Bozon’s territories, then wipe out its forces hidden in caverns and lurking in underground seas, before destroying the main invasion ship. Lots of extra weapons can be picked up, often with similar tokens to those in 1943 and some other Capcom titles. Most weapons can be shot either to the left or the right, giving you more range to launch attacks.</desc>

		<name>Sidewinder</name>
		<desc>This vertically scrolling shoot 'em up varies from the standard for this style of game, as it also features a degree of horizontal scrolling. The screen area moves across as you reach the edge of the screen and reveals a whole new range of enemies. These include lots of static turrets as well as cannon-fodder waves of enemies.

There are 6 levels and each level starts and ends with you travelling through a tunnel, and emerging on the other side faced with a new graphical setting, be it industrial, space or woodland. After clearing the last level the tunnel leads back to the first level, so there is no real ending to the game. There are no end bosses, instead each level ends with a more difficult part with a large ground structure and increased enemies and turrets. There are 3 difficulty levels to choose from, and a 2 player mode.

Interestingly, the game was not only released for Amiga and PC, but also as a coin-op  machine for arcades. The arcade version is identical to the Amiga version, the arcade PCB  even contains parts of the Amiga operating system.</desc>

For a long while after Pearl Harbor, you are the only forces capable of striking back at the Japanese in the Pacific. Take one of the "fleet boats" and go on extended patrols of up to 2 months from Hawaii, Australia, or New Zealand. Set your difficulty/realism level and time period (early means less tech for juicier targets, later means tougher escorts, more tech, lousier targets). Contend with factors like dud torpedoes, maximum depth, and more. 

You can choose among practice run against some old hulks, recreate historical convoy attacks, go on a single patrol, or go on your own campaign, which lets you go multiple patrols until you die, get promoted, or survive the war. 

How well will you do when matched against history?</desc>

The few remaining US carriers are fighting a desperate war against the Japanese surface fleets. But the US has a secret weapon: sleek, silent, deadly... you are a Submarine Commander!

The action is viewed from within the submarine. Watch out for your speed, direction and depth. This game features 9 types of submarines to choose from, 10 types of torpedoes to fire, 14 Japanese surface ships (9 warships, 5 transport), and the entire Pacific Ocean as your battleground. The seven missions all recreate real US navy engagements. Can you sink the Yamato???</desc>

Silicon Dreams can be played as three separate games, but to obtain the maximum number of points, you must complete them in order (carrying your score from one adventure to the next). Snowball has graphics for the first time, and the other two games have more graphics than before, and some longer text descriptions are added to all 3 games.

Snowball: As Kim Kimberley, your mission is to safeguard the colonization ship Snowball 9 and its passengers. When you are awakened prematurely from hibernation, you know something's wrong!

Return to Eden: Your objective is to get into the new city of Enoch, and stop the Eden robots from destroying Snowball 9.

Worm in Paradise: You have to find as much information about the city as possible, obtain money, and then become a member of the governing party of Eden.</desc>

Player 1 would play as a helicopter, but if a second player joined the game, they would play as a jeep. Both players would have to protect each other as well as themselves. After a certain number of kills, a "goose" helicopter would form on the screen. If the players managed to destroy it they would get a weapons powerup. This would go on throughout the entire game (a "goose" could appear even during the end of level baddie!).</desc>

		<desc>SimCity sets you as the mayor of a new municipality, with the responsibility of building and maintaining a place where citizens can move to and work and be happy. The first task is to place essentials such as housing, transport links, schools, factories and shops. There are 50 types of these, allowing for homes of all standards and different types of businesses. Make sure to consider which sites are effective for which tasks. Some power sources pollute, others don't but are more expensive. Taxes must be raised to ensure an income, and then portions allocated to public services such as policing and roads. Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency situations that must be dealt to contain any damage.

Successful mayoring will cause the small village to grow into a town, then a city and finally a metropolis. As the city's size grows so do it's needs. Commercial buildings may suddenly find that they need an airport to expand trade, or housing may find itself changing rapidly as vast amounts of people come and leave.

The game also includes 8 pre-defined time-limited scenarios, with specific challenges and targets. The environment varies in each game (especially if you have the Terrain Editor add on), and this should affect your choices.</desc>

Unfortunately, the system malfunctioned and began generating real weapons and tanks to attack the outside world.

You are the man charged with putting a stop to all of this. In your ground-skimming SRV, remove the power lines that keep Simulcra functional. Shoot out each of the energy projectors which block your path to clear each of the 30 matrices.

The action is viewed from immediately behind you, showing a world of pathways and gaps which rotate as you move your craft, which can also reverse. You will have to fight off guns, planes and everything else the embattled system can throw at you. Destroying these releases pods which give extras such as improved weaponry and extra energy when collected. A full map of the area is provided.</desc>

		<desc>The world of Light is vanishing... No more glimmer, no more warmth, not even the slightest spark. Only you, Skrull the Barbarian, the incredible bastard son of the unnatural love between the Sun Woman and the Shadow Man, can free the Light again. But the gloomy world of Darkness is full of dangers...

The game represents a Barbarian clone, where you should select the available icon to allow your protagonist seen in third-person side-scrolling view perform the action. Right and left mouse buttons clicks invoke opposite actions. For example, left mouse button click on 'Move Left' icon will move Skrull left, while right mouse button click will move him right. There are seven icons to use: Stop, Move, Run, Jump, Use Sword, Up, Down. Several items may be collected in three inventory slots to be used later. In particular, such item may be a key dropped from dead Dragon to unlock a certain door.

The environment is labyrinth of dark, damp, and dangerous caves with many obstacles such as gaps to be jumped over and many different enemies such as tarantulas, vampire bats, or dragons. The key to world of Light's salvation lies hidden somewhere here and should be found by you finally.</desc>

You can also fight side by side with a friend (who controls the pirate you didn't choose).

Fighting works like fencing, with a few different moves to use, including parrying. The levels scroll through with a boss at the end of each. You gain money by vanquishing foes and digging for treasure where X marks the spot.</desc>

He ruined their bright pink land by removing the colour, and it was only after he died that they had the opportunity to clean the land up. Your job is to travel through the 99 continents and clean each one in sequence.

Skweek can move in each of the four compass directions, and is armed with a simple weapon, whose shots rebound around before they hit one of Pitark's minions, the Schnoreuls - contact with which is instantly fatal. Some squares contain arrows which force you in a particular direction, while there are also blockades to avoid. Bomb squares blow up surrounding squares but give you time to move away from them as they do this, while Shortcut squares allow you to move to another teleport-type square by pushing the joystick in its direction.</desc>

Sky High Stuntman is a top-down vertically scrolling shoot-em-up. The joystick or keyboard is used to steer while flying the helicopter, bi-plane and jet fighter. The fire button or space bar fire your weapon. Flying the balloon you use the joystick or keyboard to move a sight and shoot the enemy.

		<desc>Forward scrolling spaceship shooting game over the planet Orac, based on the Toaplan original arcade game.

Alien enemies have occupied the planet Orac in the year 2059. The Alien League Of Cosmic Nations (ALCON) has determined that you are the pilot to take the Slap Fighter (Europe) / SW475 Starfighter (US) and defeat the aliens. The main feature of the game is its pickup system. You pick up stars and then you choose which powerup you want, pick up one star and you can choose shield, two stars to choose shot, three stars to choose side shot, four for wing upgrade, five for bomb shot, six for laser shot, seven for homing missiles and eight for a shield upgrade. The homing missile is probably the most powerful weapon and the bomb is quite annoying.</desc>

In Slightly Magic you are cast as Slightly - mischievous nephew of legendary wizard Bigwiz, who has suddenly taken off on some urgent business, leaving his castle in disarray with dragons and magical spells running amok. One of the dragons kidnaps the princess, and now Slightly has to save her.

In addition to standard inventory puzzles of Dizzy games, Slightly Magic introduces a magic system that requires multiple objects to be combined in order to achieve effects ranging from frightening the enemies to turning the player into a fish.</desc>

		<desc>The year is 1999. The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.

Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.</desc>

You've aircraft carrier missions like free flight, destroy enemy aircraft carriers, destroy drug ships and destroy enemy oil supplies. 
In the air you can fight the MiG-27, Su-27, MiG-29 and MiG-31 armed with heat or radar guided missiles!

You can choose to be an existing pilot or to create a new one. 
You can choose between 2 levels of difficulty: beginner (less enemy attacks) or expert (the most dangerous).
The weather will affect the mission. The good weather will be great for training, and the stormy will be dangerous but great for attacks, as you can hide into the clouds and approach the enemy unnoticed.
You'll have a copilot that will help you telling what's going on every moment. 
You can avoid missiles using your skills, using chaff or... if you can't, you can use your parachute!</desc>

In order to reach the key you will need carefully to arrange the blocks on the screen so you can jump your way around safely. Wandering around each level are a variety of enemies which will cause you to lose a life if you're caught. Some creatures can be killed by destroying the block they are standing on, others must be dodged. Hidden bonuses and magic can be found on many of the levels, sometimes even hidden in blocks. Some treasures give you bonus points, others can form magic spells to help deal with the enemies. To make the game more difficult, each level has a time limit in which it must be completed.</desc>

This platformer is the first game featuring the characters and they have got themselves into some problems. Matthew has gone out and left Sooty in charge of the house. Problem is that Sweep has left all his old bones all over the house and left the door to the garden open so that all kinds of bugs have gotten in. The game simply involves collecting all of the bones while avoiding the creepy crawlies that are occupying the house. The player can choose to play as either Sooty or Sweep and they differ in the weapon they use. Sooty uses a magic wand while Sweep uses a water pistol. They both have the same effect on the enemies though, stunning them for a few seconds so that the player can move past. Different items can be picked up. Keys are needed to unlock doors, sticky buns can be used to attract the bugs, magic boxes recharges the wand while water bottles refill the water pistol. There is also a two player mode where Sooty and Sweep compete in getting the largest score. This is done by snatching each others bones and by throwing custard pies.</desc>

		<path>./Sorcerer Lord (1988)(PSS).zip</path>
		<name>Sorcerer Lord</name>
		<desc>Sorcerer Lord is a medieval fantasy game of tactical warfare.

The evil Shadowlord's army is threatening to overrun the peaceful country of Galanor. The alliance of races in Galanor isn't very fond of suppression, slavery or extinction, so they are preparing for war -- it's your job to coordinate the Galanorian defense.

Movement and combat are turn-based. You and the Shadowlord alternately recruit new troops, move armies on a 2D hex-map of the land and try to conquer the enemies garrisons. The outcome of fights is shown as plain text only. Although the gameplay is quite simple, there are a few tactical knacks like certain races fighting more fiercely in certain terrain types, fatigue levels and basic statistics for army leaders. Despite the game's title, magic is a rather unimportant element of chance in battles and not under your direct control.

The game contains a time limit; you've got 40 turns in easy level, less in advanced levels.</desc>

		<name>Speedball</name>
		<desc>The original future sport game, Speedball is played out on a small court with five players on each team, making it more frantic than the more famous sequel. The ball must be thrown into the goal at your opponent's end. Any amount of physical contact can be made, and there are no illegal ways to get the ball or the goal.

Before each match you can bribe the referee into awarding you a head-start or strengthening the abilities of your players. You compete in a simple knockout cup tournament, or in individual 2-player games.</desc>

It's two years since the last ball was thrown on a Speedball pitch. There are new teams, new stadia and new rules. The arena is bigger, the players are tougher and the action is faster than ever before.
The challenge is this. Take control of Brutal Deluxe, the worst team in Speedball history, and turn them into champions.</desc>

		<desc>Terrorists have seized control of some of the world's most prestigious harbours, such as London and New York. As a tough marine commando, you have been sent in to launch the counter-attacks.

Sensibly, your boss drops you into the action in front of a mine field, and with no armour. Negotiate the mine field and you come into the main body of action, in which weaponry can be collected either from that which is left lying around, or by docking with a supply helicopter when it comes into view. Enemy ships are all around and must be taken out. Clear these and you reach the towers, which must be shot down, and finally a 'boss' ship to complete the level.</desc>

		<name>Spherical</name>
		<desc>Solomon's Key is a clear conceptual influence for this action puzzler. Our hero must guide a ball through a level to the spot marked 'In', by creating and removing blocks to alter its path. The game is prevented from being a pure clone due to the ball, which moves automatically once activated, and can be controlled by using strategically-placed blocks.

Simply reaching the ball usually involves modifying the level layout using these bricks. There are enemies moving on fixed paths which must be avoided, and bonus items to collect. Also watch for bonuses such as invincibility, gravity-alteration and teleporting. You take time to rotate, so the controls aren't truly immediate. The ball takes 20 seconds to start moving, so use this time to plan ahead.</desc>

		<desc>On it's most basic level, Spindizzy Worlds is, like its predecessor, similar to Marble Madness. Controlling GERALD, you must move through the isometrically viewed landscape (largely flick-screen on the ST). There are two skill levels; the harder one features more of the precarious ledges and falls of Spindizzy. Each one takes you to a different matrix of levels, which can be played in different orders and each consist of 10 screens, with a bonus level at the end.

You have limited energy, which can be recharged by collecting crystals. Fuel is limited, and is reduced by contact with hazards - generating a replacement GERALD takes time. There are many gates which are opened by running into spaces of the same colour. There are also aliens to avoid, and most movement is along thin slippery ledges with heavily inertia-based controls.</desc>

To avoid this, one ruler of the world must be determined in this beat 'em up involving six rulers: U.S.A.'s Ronald Regan, the U.K.'s Margaret Thatcher, the USSR's Mikhail Gorbachev, South Africa's PW Botha, Iran's Ayathollah Khomeini, and Pope John Paul II.</desc>

		<name>Spot</name>
		<desc>A puzzle game loosely featuring licensing from the 7Up soft drink. The gameplay involves up to 4 players, which can be either human or computer, each taking on spots of a particular colour. Starting from opposite corners, they take it in turns to move, either by 'reproducing' one of their spots to form another one in an adjacent square, or by making a jump, losing the square you did have but taking one two spaces away.

When a piece lands next to one of another colour, that piece changes colour into that of their opponent. The winner of each round is either the last player with any pieces left, or the player who has the most pieces left when the level is full.</desc>

		<name>Spy vs Spy</name>
		<desc>MAD magazine's comic strip of the same name comes to life in this game which was designed for one or two players. The split-screen shows both spies at the same time. Play with a friend or against the machine.

The black spy and the white spy are out to outsmart each other before the time bell rings. Find the needed objects (money, passport, secret plans and airport door key) by searching rooms in the embassy, which include desks, file cabinets and other furniture. Foil your opponent by setting creative booby traps in the various rooms (a bomb in a dresser drawer, for instance). Traps can be disarmed with objects found in rooms (a water bucket from a firebox on the wall will disarm the bomb in the prior example). When all the items are together in the secret briefcase, head for the airport door.

Fights ensue when both spies enter the same room and are armed with clubs.</desc>

		<name>Stack Up</name>
		<desc>A good alternate title for this one would be Rows - not the kind you have when your wife finds lipstick on your shirt collar, but as an equivalent of Columns. The gameplay is essentially the same - groups of 3 variably-colored blocks fall towards the bottom of a 6x18 grid, and you must arrange them into groups of 3 of the same colour - except that the blocks are grouped horizontally rather than vertically.

Each individual brick falls as far as it can when you place the trio, so they won't necessarily all end up on the same line. Blocks fall as far as possible to fill gaps when lines are completed, so there are never gaps in the arrangement the way you get in Tetris. Each level sets you a target number of lines to form - 4 or 5 in a row count as 2 and 3 lines respectively for this calculation, a lá Klax. Horizontal lines score the least, with diagonals the most lucrative and vertical in between (this change from Columns makes sense considering the different building method).</desc>

To do this he must blow bubbles to catch the grubs that they feed on and guide them through the level by blowing on them or nudging them past any obstacles in the way to the nest where T'yungunz live.  To complete a level, you must make sure that a certain number of T'yungunz are fully fed so they go to sleep.  If they don't get enough food then eventually they die.

The levels are full of contraptions such as bellows, and obstacles such as spikes and fire that will burst the bubbles.  Some of these can be activated or deactivated using various switches.

Usually Steg navigates each level by walking on the floor, and also he can climb up the walls and even walk on the ceiling.  There are also devices he can contruct out of the parts from the Acme Bionic Bitz Catalogue, such as the Rocket Pack, and Bionic Legs, which allow different ways of getting around each level.</desc>

		<name>Stone Age</name>
		<desc>Stone Age is a challenging puzzle game where you are in control of a dinosaur and you have to make him reach the exit of each cave. The dinosaur can only walk on certain blocks on the level: some are just ordinary blocks, some are movable in the direction the arrow points, some crumble after you walk on them, and some have coloured keys which are needed to get past locks of the same colour.

The game has two difficulty modes, one giving you more time to complete the levels than the other, and every time you run out of time, you lose a life. The levels are coded so you don't lose your progress when you quit, although you'll lose any score gained.

The graphics are simple and cartoony, and the levels come in a variety of scenarios. The game also includes a Jukebox, which allows you to customize the played tracks much like a playlist editor.</desc>

As you progress through the levels of platform-adventure action, you will come across fairies which are rescued by touching them. Enemies include Venus Fly Traps, localized acid rain showers and dragons, which can be avoided or shot in the bonus shoot 'em up sections. You will need help to reach some levels; this comes from Mael Dvin the Eagle. After each level there's a bonus game in which tears must be collected for points.</desc>

		<name>Stratego</name>
		<desc>The board game Stratego is a more elaborate version of Capture the Flag. Each player starts with 40 pieces; made up by the flag, 5 bombs, and an assortment of 9 types of military units. 

After these have been placed, each player takes it in turn to move their pieces. Other than scouts (which are the least powerful) the units can only move one space at a time.The flag and bombs can't be moved during the game, so watch out for any squares the computer does not move when it otherwise logically should, and these could be your goal.

When you choose a square occupied by an opposition piece, combat arises, and the higher-numbered piece is lost from the game. You have no way of knowing what strength the opposition pieces are until you have hit them. 

This computerized interpretation has 3 different board layouts, a selection of automatic setups with different strategic benefits, and a demo mode.</desc>

After each country you will have the chance to get additional points in a little bonus round, a feature seen later in most Street Fighter games. 

The final boss in the game is Sagat, who is the second to the last boss in Street Fighter 2. The goal is to become the greatest fighter in the world. As with most tournament fighting games once you have defeated the boss the game will reset and start from the beginning with a harder difficulty level. 

It is possible to start a two player game but there will be only one fight (between the two players) which will determine who will travel the globe to fight the computer controlled opponents.</desc>

There are 64 international teams on offer, with a European-style knock-out cup competition included. Many different formations and strategies are offered.</desc>

		<name>Subbuteo</name>
		<desc>Subbuteo recreates the famous table football game, which makes for something very different from Sensible/Kick Off/FIFA style games. It's effectively a turn-based strategy game of sorts, as each player has 30 seconds to make their move (within a 30 minute match length), which involves first selecting a player, then aiming the direction in which he will be flicked, then the power and swerve of the flick are determined by the length of time the button is held down for. 

With any luck, your player will hit the ball, and hit it such that it doesn't leave the playing area, and doesn't hit an opponent. If any of those rules are violated, possession passes to the opposition. Before each flick, the team not in possession can make a 'defensive flick' involving moving one of their players into a potential blocking position (without hitting the ball or an opponent, as this is a foul).</desc>

As before, the racing is overhead view and against a field of 9 computer cars, with championship points awarded for finishing positions. The computer drivers now take on the humourous names from Lotus 1, such as 'Ayrton Sendup' and 'T Hairy Bootson'. The most noticeable addition is a split screen 2 player mode. 

The power ups have been changed around from the original, with the handling improvements gone, so as to put more of an emphasis on learning to control the slippery cars. These have been replaced by further weapons and more engine upgrades.

The questions from the original have been replaced by mock driving test questions about stopping distances and the like - as before, money and points are won and lost depending on your answers.</desc>

The levels are populated with bats, trolls and snakes, which have programmed attack patterns and follow you off the screen. You can collect and cast up to 12 spells, which are accessed using the cursor or function keys (the manual amusingly refers to Amigas having F11 and F12 keys, which they don't). These include upgraded weapons (the default one isn't especially powerful), and help such as magic staircases and a metal melter. Some sections of water kill you, other identical ones take you to different sections.</desc>

These include those 3 as well as police cars, go-karts and a tank, which is too slow to be competitive but allows you to shoot out the other cars, and can be a blockade as you try to lap it.

Up to 6 cars can be featured in each race, and you can race over 3,4 or 5 laps. Four human players are supported, 2 on joysticks and 2 on keyboard</desc>

		<desc>This is a conversion of Sega's popular motorcycle racing arcade game.  In this game you race a motorcycle around the world, completing each section of track within a time limit. There are other bikes on the road, but beating this is not important, so they can be thought of as moving obstacles. Each continent is a different difficulty level: Africa is beginner, Asia is junior, the Americas are senior, and Europe is expert.  

This is a very simple and straightforward game, viewed from behind the bike in 2D (so the screen does not tilt with the bike). The right/left controls are steering, and up/down are gear changes. Your cycle is always moving, and your speed strictly depends on the gear you are in, although contact or running off the road slows the bike down.</desc>

		<name>Super Monaco GP</name>
		<desc>Super Monaco GP is a modified conversion of the arcade game, a first-person perspective racing game. As well as the famous Monaco course, others from around the world have been added, to give the game a longer shelf life. You must complete qualification sessions and the races as fast as possible.

The Genesis version of Super Monaco adds a complete career mode, however.  In the career mode, your goal is to win a season of races. Unfortunately, you start with a relatively slow car.  By challenging other drivers, you can move to a better team and car, and ultimately win the F1 World Title.</desc>

		<name>Super Scramble Simulator</name>
		<desc>Super Scramble Simulator recreates the sport of scrambling/ motorcross, but in a manner similar to the Kikstart TV show and games. The basic aim is to ride a motocross bike through hazardous courses within the time limits.

The game uses a split-screen display, with a big window viewed from the side as well as a longer-range aerial view - the latter is useful for dodging hazards to the left or right, as the side-view doesn't demonstrate these accurately. The bike has 3 gears, and you must use a low gear to go uphill. You will need to do wheelies to ensure good landings from the big jumps, and to clear divots in the ground.</desc>

With game design showing some obvious influence from Bomb Jack, Seymour jumps around a series of single screen areas collecting barrels of toxic waste. One barrel at a time is highlighted and is worth more points than the others, but will explode after a short countdown. Seymour is plagued by mutants which fly and bounce around the screen. Some must be jumped on from above, some must be hit from below.</desc>

In Super Skweek, you play the title character who must walk around and either paint all the tiles of the game board pink, complete a specific mission, or both.  Some tiles react in various ways when you walk on them, like exploding.  

Unlike Chip's Challenge, the game plays in realtime and you can pick up and use weapons to keep away certain monsters as you paint the tiles.  There is also a shop you can enter to purchase items.  Finally, levels have a time limit for completion.</desc>

		<desc>In this puzzle board game you should swap the tiles to make the sequence of tiles of the same color to eliminate them.
Shape of tiles varies from big and small squares to triangles or hexagons. If tiles have no neighbor tiles you may take appropriate tiles from the pocket of the limited size to eliminate the rest of the tiles. Finishing the level, player will be transferred to the higher level if the results of the current level were high enough for such level. But to finish level successfully, player should acquire the certain number of points and to be qualified for the next level. The difficulty also raises and depends on quantity of colours, the shape of the tiles, and time limit presence. Undo moves are also present, but such moves decrease your final results. Game may be saved in progress and loaded later. 

Best scores and levels will be written in High Score Table.</desc>

The gameplay is platform and ladders based, set both inside and outside. The layout of the territories becomes visible as you progress, and they can contain bonus weapons and secret rooms. Unlike the sequel you start without weaponry, and this is gained directly, rather than you collecting coins and trading them at shop sections. Holding down fire progressively builds up your fighting power.</desc>

One player controlled a helicopter and the other a jeep, with the jeep transforming into a boat when the vehicles passed over water. As well as a host of blaster fodder the game also included a mid-level enemy inspired by the "Goose" enemy from the earlier title Silkworm. Pieces of this enemy would fly onto the screen and assemble into one vehicle before commencing to fire at the players' vehicles. When destroyed the "goose" would drop power-ups.</desc>

All this is done against a time limit. As well as points for clearing a level, you get bonus time for completing them with time to spare. This bonus time can then be used on later levels if you run out of the allotted time. Once you have no bonus time, you can dig into your main score to provide more time.
There are two difficulty levels - the Novice level sees time elapse half as quickly as the Expert mode, and presents the levels in an approximate order of difficulty, whereas in Expert mode they are in randomised order.</desc>

Contact with other bikes or the scenery gradually increases the damage percentage, which will eliminate you at 100%. Crashing results in an external replay of your final moments.

Joystick and mouse control options exist, with the mouse being ultimately faster but harder to learn. 125, 250 and 500cc options exist, with the difficulty higher on the more powerful bikes. You can contest a full season, single race, or simply practice on a free track. 

16 circuits are featured, from Suzuka and Misano to Rijeka and Philip Island, with races over 5-50 laps. Your opponents are seven factory Suzuki riders from various classes at the time, including 1993 500cc World Champion Kevin Schwantz.</desc>

As Commander Sean Bannon, you must use these resources correctly in five missions ranging from defending a hill to attacking a centre through a forest.

The control interface of the game is somewhat unique as it features a four-way split screen with different control options in order to grant direct orders to four individual platoons of tanks. The game simulates  instruments of war including thermal imaging in a very detailed manner, as well as giving access to scrolling maps of the battlefield as combat unfolds.</desc>

		<desc>Terry's Big Adventure looks and feels somewhat similar to Mario's, being a side-scrolling platform game using stylised block graphics and lots of ledges to climb up and around. Terry is armed with a yo-yo which can be directed as a weapon by pushing the joystick as you hold down fire - an idea later repeated by Trolls. On this occasion the use of the yo-yo  causes Terry to recoil slightly, so be careful that this does not push him off a ledge or into the path of another enemy.

There are 12 levels in total, incorporating many rivers to cross as well as hordes of hedgehogs, snails and similar to kill. Hidden bonus objects and time extensions can be found.  When you start a new game you start form the last level you reached, so you effectively have unlimited continues.</desc>

Different joystick combinations let your fighter perform high, middle or low attacking moves as well as dodge or block his opponent's attacks. Fighters receive scores for successful attacks. The more difficult or effective the attack, the higher the score. Unless one fighter is knocked out, the fighter who has the highest score at the end of three rounds wins.

Although the game is shown from an isometric perspective, it is not possible to move in three dimensions.</desc>

During 12 levels of gameplay enemies fly towards you, and you should shoot them or avoid them, because each meeting with the enemy means decreasing the number of instances of your transformer. You'll also need to collect spheres to maintain your fuel levels. When all instances of your spacejet will be lost you may be enlisted in the High Score Table.</desc>

		<desc>Thunderstrike is a 3d spaceship shooter set in the year 2238, using a non-textured polygon graphics engine. As a pilot in the "Ground Defense Games", you must make your way through several arenas built on different planets. You can choose from four different ships, each with different properties (better/worse acceleration, top speed, or turning speed).

When you enter the arena, you are given several pyramids that you must defend from robotic drones sent out to collapse them. In addition to defending your pyramids, you must destroy the spawning centers that spawn not only drones, but an array of robotic fighters to hunt you down.

When you destroy a fighter, sometimes it will leave behind an upgrade pod (shield, turbo, power, or twin-fire). There are also tracks that you can latch your ship onto to travel the perimeter of the arena quickly.

At the end of each round, your performance is reviewed, and if you did good, your ship is upgraded and you move on to the next round.</desc>

This is an adventure with action elements. Most of the game is spent manipulating objects in the different time zones which have an effect on a later zone, e.g. planting a seed in the stone age will cause a tree to appear in the later zones. He also may need to bring an object from one time to another. In each zone there is one big puzzle to solve in order to get access to the next zone (the ultimate goal is to prevent the time machine from getting destroyed), but constant traveling between the time zones is necessary.</desc>

You control a cross-hair, and press fire while over a Brainy to take or give up control of its motion. Running out of time costs you a life. The challenge lies in the fact that you can only control the direction in which a Brainy will walk. Once this is set, he will continue to walk until he hits a wall, an obstacle or another Brainy. To make things a bit more complicated, there are various obstacles like arrows that change the direction a Brainy is walking in and items than can optionally be picked up.</desc>

		<path>./Titan (1989)(Titus)[cr Medway Boys].zip</path>
		<name>Titan</name>
		<desc>Titan is a 2D arcade game / puzzle game hybrid.

For some reason, mad professors of the future tend to invent strange entertainment games in which every participant dies. Professor Hybrys’ variant is called Titan and involves a ball, a control unit and 80 labyrinths. Your objective is either to destroy all destructible blocks in each level by hitting them with the sphere, or to pilot it to the exit. The black ball is beyond your control; it will bounce straight or diagonally through the labyrinth with constant speed. You move the control unit, a small box, with you are to position in a way that the ball bounces off it in the desired direction. You can also catch the sphere by quickly moving over it, and then release it in a direction of your choice.

The labyrinths not only contain harmless, destructible blocks, but also increasingly difficult hazards. If the sphere or your control unit hit a skull symbol, one of your nine lives is lost. Teleporters exchange the position of you and the ball, wall pieces can be pushed around or destroyed by your unit, floor tiles will grow into walls when you pass over them too often. The high game speed can be slowed down by holding the space key – a very useful option in tricky situations.

Titan mixes an arcade game foundation (requiring quick reflexes and good nerves) with puzzle game elements (requiring logical thinking to beat the complex levels). The challenge is to control the sphere accurately, yet indirectly.</desc>

		<desc>An imaginative action game in which you must guide a ball-shaped craft through a succession of levels. These have a patchwork-quilt type display, with holes to avoid, and squares of various colors, which affect the craft's speed, both within its power potential and into warp, as well as a control-reverser and lots of holes. You can jump these holes by pressing fire, although you have a limited number of these for each level, and adjust the speed by pulling the joystick forward or backwards.  You face a time limit on each of the 21 levels, although your time is boosted every time you complete one. A simultaneous 2-player mode is included, similar to the split-screen mode in the Lotus games (by the same authors).</desc>

		<desc>Based on sportscar and Paris-Dakar racer René Metge and his Porsche 944 Turbo, Turbo Cup is a racing game viewed from above and behind the car, in a forced perspective. Instead of the sand of the Dakar race, the game features four conventional French racetracks - Paul Ricard, Nogaro, Magny-Cours and Dijon-Prenois. 

After completing a qualifying lap you race against 21 similar cars. Contact with cars from behind causes you to spin but does not affect your rival, although side-on contact is usually beneficial. There are hazards off the track to avoid, and hitting the grass at speed causes a spin.</desc>

		<desc>Finding the mysterious Elephant's Graveyard in Africa was your Father's lifelong quest. When he disappears you are determined to find out what might have happened to him, and what secrets may lie within.

This side scrolling arcade adventure is split into three stages, taking in the harsh and barren desert, an underground network of caves, and a tough tribal jungle. The natives are hostile to your presence, and weaponry must be found to fend them off, although its use does little to put the natives at ease initially. The machete to cut through the jungle is equally important. At many other points you will need to use objects you have found along the way. The backgrounds are in full 3D and can serve to obscure the character when he is behind trees or rocks.</desc>

You then bring the passes and runs to life on the pitch itself. You can play single matches or full leagues, with any of the NFL teams of the time.</desc>

As Ulopa, the sole survivor, you must reclaim the pieces. They are spread across 23 levels of platforming action, combining surface areas with some underground tunnels. You have 3 types of weapons with different functionality: switching between them at the right moments is vital. You can also collect upgrades from the carcasses of dead enemies. Other upgrades such as springs and a parachute can also be found.</desc>

The game never played like a "shoot-'em-up" - too much persistant firing was never much use - and required more tactics.</desc>

		<desc>Side-scrolling shoot-em-up, in a similar style to such games as Gradius, R-Type and Scramble. The aim is to wipe out the enemy, which has gathered around the allied airspace of 'Area 88', in a series of military aircraft-based scenarios.
 You choose one of three unique pilots; Shin Kazama, Micky Schymon or Greg Gates, each with varying abilities at damage repair, weapon handling and flying skill, and engage the enemy over a series of challenging missions. The player starts out with the weakest plane, the F8E Crusader, which can only be armed with a very basic range weapons. But, through completing various missions, enough cash can be raised to purchase higher-quality aircraft. These superior planes are more agile, have improved resilience to damage and have a greater range of fire. Furthermore, the more advanced fighters can be armed with superior special weapons, such as napalm.
 The missions include attacks on sand bases, the nuclear submarine 'Seavet' and enemy supply camps, as well as seeing off groups of airborne 'bandits' who swarm-in on Area 88.
 The enemy is plentiful, and the pace is frantic. Shoot at everything on the screen that moves, and the allied forces might just come out on top......</desc>

Van Helsing's method of killing is to use mirrors to reflect his beam of light onto them. He must always keep this under control. Bats and snakes must be avoided, as they cost Van Helsing energy. Coffins must be avoided, as they release nasties which will chase you.</desc>

		<desc>In this first person driver/shooter, the player must protect a body's base cells from attack by evil infecting cells.  The field of battle is a toroidal grid on which your tri-colored half-sphere base cells sit awaiting your protection.  The invading cells (also tri-colored spheres) attempt to bond together into groups and destroy your bases.  You destroy the infecting cells by lobbing antibodies (also tri-colored spheres) at them.  Hit an infector with the right color shot and it is destroyed.  The catch is that you have a limited amount of each color of ammunition.  Run out of a color and the game is over.  The situation is also complicated by Spitters, enemies that appear and spew out new attacking cells if you take too long to complete a level.</desc>

Most sentient creatures release a ball when killed; shoot this to release one of many features such as enhanced weaponry, faster movement, an extra life, or negative ones like losing a life or having your controls reversed.

		<desc>A multi-level vertically scrolling shoot 'em up along similar lines to SWIV. You fly a plane through inhospitable landscapes full of enemy fighters and gun turrets. Most of the planes come at you in formation, firing easily-visible orange bullets at you, and can be either shot or avoided. The turrets are capable of rotating in 8 directions and aiming at you as best they can, so be careful to dodge their bullets. 

There are also larger vehicles which fly down the screen in a direct vertical line. The helicopters hold power-ups including extra weapons (which you only get for a limited number of shots; this is the one time where holding down fire constantly (on an auto fire joystick) isn't hugely beneficial), speed-ups and energy recharge (once your vehicle's damage reaches 100%, you lose that one of your 5 lives). The planes are huge and fire a constant volley at you, but offer a huge 5,000 points if taken down. At the end of each level an even bigger plane comes at you, weaving from left to right while gradually moving down the screen (and eventually out of the bottom of the screen and back through the top).</desc>

		<name>Volfied</name>
		<desc>Volfied is a home conversion of an arcade coin-op developed by Taito in the late '80s. The game is very similar to Qix -- the player takes control of an object whose purpose is to roam the screen, forming shapes and removing them from the play field. By way of reward, a picture is gradually revealed in the removed areas of the screen. The borders of the area which the player has not cleared become the border of the area the player's pointer can move along.

The player's object must avoid contact with any of the enemies which float around the screen, as this will weaken and eventually destroy it. Barriers limit which parts of the border boxes can be formed through. The goal is to clear 80% or more of the screen, and each additional percent adds bonus points.

As an arcade conversion this game allows for one or two player games in three difficulty levels, but offers no passwords or saved games across its numerous levels.</desc>

Voyager is viewed from on board the craft, and is a first person shoot 'em up using polygon graphics. You start with a laser and a few bombs, but can collect extra weaponry and the ability to fly through the mothership. Not all enemies can be killed simply by shooting them, so there is a tactical element to the slaughter.</desc>

		<desc>Waterloo, arguably the most famous battle in history, was fought on June 18, 1815 between the French Forces of the Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte and the English and combined Allied forces under the Duke of Wellington and Prussian forces under Field Marshall Blucher.

Waterloo the game was a revolutionary new concept in wargaming when it was published in 1989. Waterloo dispensed with the normal overview given to wargame commanders and instead gave a player the same point of view as real commanders on the field of battle.

Your orders in an age of pre-radio communication must pass through an elaborate chain of command with varying levels of success in the execution of those orders. Your orders may even be ignored if there is better local intelligence or your officers lack the skill or courage to perform them. You as the commander (Napoleon or Wellington) must even deal with a time delay in the occurrence in events and the time it takes for those events to be relayed back to HQ and the time it takes to issue orders and see those orders carried out. A text parser is used to issue orders during the game. The battle ends at 9:30 pm at which time full battle reports will become available and the results assessed. You are also given the option to review the battlefield.The game is solitaire only and the playing time is 10-20 hours.</desc>

It has the same gameplay concept as Tetris; simply all the player has to do is to rotate and maneuver the falling pieces into a proper position in order to form complete layers in the rectangular playground. But Welltris changes this rectangular arena into a four sided well with grid-like walls and bottom where the falling pieces can be moved from wall to wall within the well. Form the pieces into solid rows either horizontally or vertically on the bottom of the well.

		<name>Western Games</name>
		<desc>Western Games has six Wild West themed sport-style events. In Arm Wrestling you must pull the joystick back when the arm in the central display has entered a strong phase and press the button to prop the arm up then hope for the best. 

The Beershooting event requires you to shoot a 5 beer glass targets faster than your opponent, but this is not too easy if you get nervous.Player 1 moves the joystick to the right to draw their gun, while Player 2 must move theirs to the left. Once the gun is drawn, the crosshairs are used to line up the target. Press the joystick button to fire. A beating heart shows the degree of your nervousness in the display. 

Quid-spitting requires that you bite off the right amount of tobacco and chew it to just the right consistency before you determine what angle to spit it into the pot. This requires some fancy joystick handling. To lift your arm and bite off the quid, you must move the joystick forward.To chew, you must move the joystick fast to the left and right. Don't chew it too long or too short. To stop chewing, you must move the joystick forward. Once that is done you must pull the stick back to determine the strength. Click and hold the joystick button to determine the right angle. Press the joystick button to spit. Timing is the key. 

The Milking event has a rhythmically heaving udder indicating the beat that you must move the joystick. To fill the cans, the joystick must be moved in a predetermined pattern, but it must be moved rythmically with the udder. You can elbow your opponent to get the upper hand by moving your joystick to the right and pressing the joystick button. 

Dancing requires a complicated routine of joystick movements to do certain dance moves while keeping the beat. Lose the beat and the other guys bash the piano player on the head causing him to stop playing. You must buy the piano player another beer to have him resume playing. 

The Eating competition is the final event. Dip the spoon into the stew. Balance the spoon. Slurp. Chew. Swallow. and drink. Simple? No. If you get some out of order, you get delayed by belching. Dip the spoon by moving the joystick back. Balance the spoon by moving the joystick to the left and right.; Once leveled, slurp. Chew by again moving the joystick to the right and left. To swallow, pull the joystick back and press the joystick button. Finish it off with a drink before you dip the spoon in again, by moving the joystick forward.</desc>

		<desc>While flying three members of the same family, your planes crash-lands in an area where it soon becomes clear that time has stood still - dinosaurs still roam the area, and the humans are primitive and carnivorous. Your task is to guide them to safety through the complex isometrically viewed world (using the same basic game engine as Denton Designs' Great Escape license).

Hazards to be faced include the aforementioned dinosaurs and cavemen, as well as sea monsters, precarious mountainous ledges and dilapidated bridges. Objects including weapons and first aid kits can be collected. Each character has his own distinct behaviors - one becomes hungry easily, while another is only really competent while his fiancé survives. Although the ultimate aim is to save all four characters, you can continue while at least one is alive.</desc>

		<name>Wings of Death</name>
		<desc>Wings of Death is a vertically scrolling shoot'em'up with a fantasy setting. You start out as a small insect, flying through a deranged castle filled with hostile animals and monsters.

The upgrade system is rich, and differs somewhat from genre conventions. As you upgrade, your insect turns into a more powerful bat or a mighty dragon. Shooting enemies reveals the various upgrades, and picking up several upgrades of the same kind upgrades that particular weapon level after level. Enemies may also release anti-powerups, marked by a skull. These will downgrade your weapon or draw your energy level.

After fighting the end boss of the castle, a three-headed dragon, you move onto a jungle, a swamp and further... That is, if you survive. Wings of Death has an unparalleled number of bullets and enemy objects on-screen for its time and platform, the maximum number being reported as 95. Coded by former demo programmers, the game also runs in full 50 or 60 Hz scrolling while playing digitised music even on an Atari ST, thanks to inventive hardware tricks used in few other commercial games. It also utilises the extra colour palettes of the Atari STe.</desc>

		<name>Wizball</name>
		<desc>In Wizball the player takes the role of the friendly wizard Wiz who can turn himself into a green ball that is able to defend his world against the color-sucking enemies who have turned his once brightly colored Wizworld into a drab planet. With his trusty feline companion Catelite, the wizard will restore the colors to the world by retrieving them from defeated enemies.

The player starts out as a bouncing green ball that can shoot and be put into more or less heavy rotation to move slowly or faster, physically correct through the side-scrolling levels. The first task is to upgrade the ball by shooting the first non-moving enemies, and collect the green bubbles that are left by them. In order to stand a chance against the following moving enemy waves, some upgrades are a must. First and foremost, complete control over the ball should be activated (i.e. flying through the levels), a shield sheltering the top and bottom of the player's should be acquired, and two-way fire (left/right) should be obtained.

But the extra needed to advance in Wizball is your friend Catelite who will, once summoned, take the form of a small green satellite that will imitate the ball's movement, or can be directly controlled by the player. Besides upping Wiz' fire power, Catelite is able to collect paint drops left by a certain kind of defeated enemies until the respective color pot is filled up. There's three colors available (red, green and blue), and several different combinations of them must be collected to complete a level and restore it to former colorfulness. Every color combination collected will send Wiz to a bonus stage, then to his laboratory where one of the power-ups can be made permanently.

The game also features a bunch of multi-player modes, there's even a two-player cooperative mode amongst them.</desc>

		<name>World Championship Boxing Manager</name>
		<desc>Manage a stable of 3 wannabe heavyweight world champions in this unusual twist of the standard football management style. The option are selected through an icon-based system, representing your office.

Training your fighters involves deciding which areas they should work on, considering their strengths and weaknesses and any damage inflicted in previous fights, and those of their next opponent. 

There are 97 of these in the game, so reaching the top of the rankings will take 15-20 fights, just like real life. Choosing a beatable opponent, but one who can get your fight as high up the Friday Night bill as possible, negotiating the best financial deal, and a mutually agreeable dare, are the main considerations.

Two different governing bodies are included in the game, each with subtly different rules, and a fight in one set of rules won’t be viewed quite as significantly by the other.

The matches are presented from the commentary box, with the 2 expert analysts exchanging textual descriptions of the key punches, and who is dong the best (a clue to how any judges’ decision would go). Before and during the fights you can instruct your man as to what tactics to adopt.</desc>

		<desc>This soccer game lets you choose a team representing one of twenty-four countries around the world to participate in the World Championship tournament. This is identical to the real 1990 World Cup.

Once you pick your team you can also select which players you want on the field, so that you can round out the team's strengths and weaknesses. Also provided are modes for single exhibition matches, either against the computer or against a friend.

The action is viewed from above with large player sprites. Violent play is encouraged as there are no free kicks. Whereas later sports games often carry heavy focus on the attention to detail, this game is rather simplified -- you can only control the player closest to the ball, for example, and it is missing many of the rules of soccer such as penalty flags and offsides.</desc>

		<path>./Wreckers (1991)(Denton Designs)[cr Elite].zip</path>
		<name>Wreckers</name>
		<desc>Wreckers is an isometric sci-fi action game with strategy elements.

Robotic droids roll quietly through the corridors of space station Beacon 04523N, automated computers calculate routes for interstellar traffic. Three human officers sleep in cryogenic tanks, awakened only for routine system checks – or in case of an emergency. With a hum, the cryogenic control springs on-line as Beacon’s long-range sensors detect incoming lifeforms.

Controlling one of the on-board officers, you have to defend the station against swarms of plasmodian spores (the “Wreckers”) showering down on Beacon and seeping into its four sections. While the spores approach, you can suck them out of space with a gigantic hoover-like space hose. Once they settle onto the stations hull, jump into the space suit and spray infected areas with a cleansing agent. Undetected spores will seep into the station’s corridors, where you must hunt them down with a plasma shots and avoid being shot in return.

In addition, up to ten droids are under your (indirect) control. Ranging from cleaners to fighters to engineers, these automatons will act independently, but can be sent to key locations within the station -- i.e. infected areas. As your officer gains experience through battles, he will be promoted to higher ranks, enabling him to construct more efficient fighter robots in the station’s droid factory.

Since plasmodians running rampant in the station will cause system malfunctions, your main goal is to clear infections quickly and make sure that Beacon continues to function properly. To make things worse, an self-destruct mechanism will explode the station in 60 minutes unless all signs of spore activity cease. 

Effective droid construction and assignment, quick reactions to approaching swarms and good reflexes thus combine into a challenging race against time that makes Wreckers stand out as a clever twist of the “alien invasion” action archetype.</desc>

Through five levels, you have to shoot countless enemies, complete with the obligatory mid-level and end-level bosses. The most innovative part of this game comes after a level when you get to purchase new weapons - instead of simply buying upgrades, you can customize your ship by placing your new weapons anywhere on it.</desc>

		<name>Xenon</name>
		<desc>Xenon is the obscure and mysterious predecessor to the much better known Xenon 2: Megablast. The game is actually nothing like its sequel, with completely different control scheme and gameplay. The plot overlaps however, with the Xenites making their first attempt to control the galaxy.

Xenon is essentially an overhead shooter, where the player controls the ship and moves around the screen. However, the difference between Xenon and its sequel is that here the player actually controls the movement of the playfield (up or down) by simply moving the ship in the direction of choice. To do this in the sequel, players need to slam your ship against the bottom of the screen and pull back on the stick in order to reverse-scroll the playfield.

It also features a 3D playfield (some enemies, for example, will be mounted on hills of sort, where players can't shoot them). To combat these the player can transform its tank into a plane. The game then switches to the more familiar gameplay style as seen in other vertically scrolling shooters. The plane has to transform back into a tank again to combat most ground units.

In Xenon, upgrades are taken from destroyed enemies.</desc>

A small band of engineers has been dispatched to combat the Xeno threat before it takes over all the space stations and, eventually, your homeworld.  Assemble your band of engineers and fight the Xenos on each station, striving to either clear it or abandon it.  You start out with a standard issue laser, but can pick up additiona weapons as you find them, including Phasers, Lightning Rifles, Poofer guns, and bombs.

Xenophobe was originally an arcade coin-op by Bally/Midway, released in 1987.  Gameplay premise and setting is heavily inspired/influenced by the movie Aliens.</desc>

With either one or two players, you must move through a series of Gauntlet-style underground mazes, killing the bad guys and collecting health and other bonuses from flying saucers (underground? SLIGHT logic gap there, methinks).It's designed to be played co-operatively, although bullets from one player can harm the other.

The Xybots are out to stop you, of course, and many have advanced attack patterns as well as bullets to fire at you. Being able to view round corners is useful, allowing you to plan a strategy - often it's good to send one player forward and let the other play the waiting game, as in Gauntlet.</desc>

Whilst some shoot 'em ups are much easier with a second player, Z-Out takes design steps to legislate against this. In a 2-player game, most power-ups are unavailable, and even those which are only come into effect on level 3. Another variation is that the 1-player mode uses restart points, but the 2-player mode does not, so as to keep both players in the same place.</desc>

Zombi is a point and click adventure game in which you control the four characters (Alexandre, Sylvie, Yannick and Patrick) in turn, taking each of them individually through the abandoned complex. Lots of potentially-useful items have been left behind, some stored in cupboards - work out what they could be used for. 

Try to find a weapon with which to attack the zombies - bare-hands fighting only works for a few attempts before your character is worn out. Dead zombies should be placed in the freezer in the basement to stop them re-emerging. You have free rein over the shopping mall, and can use the bed shops to rest and the food shops for nourishment. Be wary of the dark and zombie-filled basement though.</desc>

		<name>Zone Warrior</name>
		<desc>In the distant future of the 30th century, the Earth is under attack by evil aliens, known as the Geeks. Their attempts at conquest have thus far proven unsuccessful due to humanity's advanced technology. But that might soon change: the Geeks have captured experimental time travel technology aboard an Earth defence satellite. Their plan is to travel into the past, disrupting the development of human technology, making conquest easy in the future. Our last hope is a lone soldier sent after the aliens. He must save Earth's scientists and destroy the Geeks in different time zones.

Zone Warrior is a side-scrolling platform game with exploration and shooting elements. It consists of five levels: Prehistoric, Egyptian, Medieval, Japanese and Future zones. Various enemies stand in the way, fitting the respective time period: dinosaurs and cavemen in prehistoric times, pharaohs in Egypt, robots in the future. The player's blaster can be upgraded to three- and five-way shots by collecting power-ups. Also available are various bombs and mines and a flamethrower. Levels are large and consists of distinct sections interconnected by doors and gates. To help navigating them, parts of a level map can be found. To complete a level, a number of hostages must be rescued and the Geek Commander destroyed. The Commander is located behind a security door, and a key must be found to open it. Also in each level is an armoury with some especially powerful weapons useful in defeating the Commander.</desc>

In this platformer, you can run, jump, climb walls and shoot the enemies. In the levels are also some power-ups for Zool. There are life-spending hearts, smart bombs, shields, more powerful jump-skill and a twin Zool. This "twin" makes all your motions a few seconds after you do.

In the options you can change the difficulty and the game-speed two times, the continues and the background music (Rock or Funk).</desc>

You pilot a spacecraft through the levels, shooting as many of the encroaching meanies and mounted turrets as possible. Power-up tokens are offered for shooting some, which can be used to obtain better weapons including ground-attack lasers, speed ups and multiple bullets. Extra lives are on offer as well, which you'll certainly need, especially as you have to go back a long way when losing a life.</desc>

		<name>Blood Money</name>
		<desc>The speech in the introductory sequence probably sums things up best - "the biggest unanswered question is 'where is the money?"

The player has 4 missions to take on, in each case trying to kill baddies for the money they have, which can be spent in the shop rooms to upgrade their craft. Energy is depleted by contact with enemies and the walls, although there are some baddies who simply hover on your ship and steal, rather than physically doing damage.

The game is a shoot 'em up which scrolls both horizontally and vertically, while being viewed from an R-Type style sideways perspective. Navigating the levels sometimes requires the player to duck through gaps in scenery.</desc>

		<name>Cannon Fodder</name>
		<desc>Guide a team of up to four soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this innovative top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 2. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies or buildings (by pressing both buttons at once). 

Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks to make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.</desc>

While testing the product Morlock inexplicably finds himself in the spaceship within the game. A hyperspace accident clones him thirty times. Each of the clones departs, taking with him a portion of a vital fluid that sustains Morlock's life. Assuming the persona of the brave Captain Blood, the programmer tracks down and disintegrated twenty-five clones, spending 800 years to achieve that goal. However, five clones still remain, hidden somewhere in the depths of the galaxy. Captain Blood must find these clones and destroy them before he loses his own life.</desc>

You will of course meet many more fighters throughout the level, and pick up improved weapons as the game goes on (neither of which fit with the film, or real-life logic, but make for Generic Ocean Film License #718). The gameplay is primarily side-scrolling, but the levels are taller than the screen.</desc>

		<desc>There is indeed no second prize in this race between 6 of the world’s toughest riders. First prize is the one remaining model of the greatest motorbike the world has ever seen, incidentally.

The graphics are polygon based, with lots of roadside detail, and leaning into corners to maximise turn-in leads to the graphics to tilt appropriately. The control is mouse-based, allowing for slight adjustments to be made and ensuring that the controls are realistic but not impossible. As well as your five rivals, there are lots of Sunday riders on the roads, distinguished by having brown bikes, so make sure to avoid these.

This was one of the first games to feature video-style replays, allowing you to find the exact moment you want to replay, from any part of the race, and view it at normal speed, double-speed, or freeze-frame. The camera angles on offer here include one that follows the bike, one that views the track from the side, and a TV-style chase view.</desc>

Each group of enemies you destroy grants you a cash reward and every once in a while you enter Colin's Bargain Basement, where you can use this cash to purchase upgrades for your ship like better weapons, speed &amp; health upgrades etc. Some upgrades can also be picked up during the levels.

The first part of the game has an organic feel to it, while the second part of the game features mechanical enemies. As there are some maze-like sections with dead-ends in the game, your spaceship scrolls backwards when you keep pressing the down key.</desc>

		<name>Starflight</name>
		<desc>A long time ago, a great empire comprised of Humans, Velox, Thrynn and Elowan ruled the stars. The Empire's currency was an energy source called Endurium. But something happened and this empire is no more. Furthermore, the small colony world named Arth has forgotten this heritage and technology. 1000 years have since passed and the people of Arth have rediscovered archaeological evidence of their empire. Using these discoveries, they create spaceships and form the Interstel corporation to govern the fleet. It's time to take the first steps back into space... but could it be the same enemy that destroyed the Empire still exists?

Starflight is a space exploration game. The player must first form a crew, assign their positions and customize the spaceship before blasting off from spacedock. Once out into space, the standard interface allows access to different crew members and navigation. The entire galaxy is unknown and it's up to the player to travel to distant planets to explore and land on them. Using a top-down interface, a planetary lander will venture out with the task of  finding minerals and biological data to transport back to Starport. These resources can then be used to train crew members and improve the ship. Different alien races control the galaxy and it will be up to the player to engage them diplomatically or engage them in combat. Successful exploration of the galaxy and alien cultures will yield clues and new leads as to the fate of the Empire.</desc>

		<name>Starglider</name>
		<desc>The Planet Novenia has been attacked by the Egrons, who snuck in by disguising their craft as the protected Starglider species, which Novenia's automated defenses were programmed not to shoot. 

Your task is to fight them off using only an obsolete Airborne Ground Attack Vehicle. This was designed as the ultimate combat machine, with sophisticated hardware up to Draziw Yarg's high standards. It has a fully-rechargeable shield, plasma drive unit, an inbuilt scanner and 10,000-sector map, a top speed of 2550 Urads and two homing missiles.

The game is viewed from within AGAV's cockpit, with control over speed, weapon targeting and firing. There are several control options to decide exactly how the craft works, with fixed or floating sighting, and the option of automatic centering, allowing you to balance the game between easy sighting and advanced shooting ranges.

Repair depots must be visited frequently, as they can refill the weapon bays as well as repairing the ship. Crucially, the Egron Stargliders need 3 missiles to shoot down, so at least 1 visit to a depot is required to complete this job, at which point you move up to the next, harder, level.</desc>

As well as flying through space, you must dart through tunnels under the planets, which restricted your movement range but are where most of the weapons are. As you go along you'll have to obtain objects from people, and trade them so as to be able to complete your main objectives.

The biggest advance from the original Starglider was seen as the polygon graphics, which are filled on 16-bit systems, and contain considerable detail.</desc>

You control a V-Wing fighter on many different planetoids to rescue and free a race of android slaves, the "Oids" of the game's title. The spacecraft controls are similar to a lunar-lander. Turn and thrust because gravity is always pulling at your ship. If your ship crashes into a mountain or any other obstruction on the ground, it will explode.

To survive against the various defenses on the planetoids (enemy spaceships, rockets and more) your ship is equipped with two different weapons and an energy shield. Flying around and using the energy shield costs fuel. You can refuel by landing next to a fuel base.

The main objective on each of your missions is to rescue all the Oids on each planetoid in the galaxy. To rescue the Oids, you must first destroy the factories in which they are held captive. Use only single shoots to avoid killing the Oids. Once you have blasted a factory open, the Oids will run out and wave to you. Find a flat surface nearby and land your ship. Once eight Oids have climbed aboard, or you have rescued all the Oids on the planetoid, it's time to dock with your mother-ship to complete your rescue mission.</desc>

		<desc>Step into the driving seat of one of the most wicked stunt cars around as a Stunt Car Racer. It's now up to you to prove just how good you are and to see whether or not you can ultimately become Division One Champion.
With a super-quick, turbo-charged V8 engine that will power you to incredible speeds, and long-travel suspension that enables you to soak up the bumps your car really is an awesome projectile. The tracks are totally out of this world. Banked comers that enable you to "pull g", undulating bumps that throw your car uncontrollably from side to side and huge ramps that catapult you into mid-air. In fact, you seem to spend so much time airborne, you could almost qualify for a pilot's licence!
Battle it out on the track against other computer controlled rivals, such as. Dare Devil and Road Hog. Race and jump so fast that your car starts to break up under the strain and then accelerate even more. There's no prizes for being second best in this game - it's all or nothing.</desc>

		<name>Time Bandit</name>
		<desc>Time Bandit is a Gauntlet-style arcade game with text adventure elements.

Having nothing to do with the Terry Gilliam movie Time Bandits, this game utilises the time-travel theme for a fast-paced variation on the good old Gauntlet concept. Your bandit visits 16 different worlds throughout time to grab as much loot as possible and, in the long run, do some universe-saving stuff as well.

Each of the 16 locations -- featuring such varied places like a medieval arena, a bomb factory, a wrecked spaceship and a ghost town -- is basically a labyrinth filled with treasure and -- you guessed it -- monsters. You've got to dodge these or blast them with your weapon, while collecting keys, opening doors and searching for the exit. Although theoretically each location consists of 16 sub-levels, these are merely the basic layout flipped or mirrored, some items redistributed and the monster speed increased. After completing a level, you return to the world map, where you may freely choose the next challenge (nice) and save your game (very nice).

Interestingly, Time Bandit tries to spice up the fast arcade action with text adventure scenes. Due to this strange mixture, you will occasionally bump into persons or computer consoles with which interaction is possible. For example, you've got to explore and repair the damaged spaceship Excalibur. However, the parser is crude at best; you'll have to know exactly what to do, or else you will trigger no reaction. 

Gaming veterans will discover a score of elements of and allusions to arcade classics, such as Gauntlet (obviously), Pac-Man, Centipede, Bomberman, and others.</desc>

		<name>Total Recall</name>
		<desc>Doug Quaid is a mild-mannered construction worker with a gorgeous wife in an apartment on futuristic Earth.  Plagued by restless feelings and dreams of Mars, he heads to Rekall, Inc to purchase a commercial memory implant of a Martian vacation ("cheaper, better, and safer than the real thing"). However, the implant procedure uncovers latent memories of Quaid's real life as a secret agent for the Martian government. Pursued relentlessly by his former employers, Quaid must fight from Earth to Mars in a battle to reclaim his past and secure his future.

Total Recall for the Amiga and Atari ST has players controlling Quaid as he fights through seven levels on Earth and Mars.  The game alternates between platforming levels and driving levels.  Platforming levels require Quaid to fight guards and find the exit. The player can duck to avoid bullets, and fight back with both captured weapons and meaty Schwarzenegger fists. The first level requires the player to locate items to open the exit, and a later level has the player switching control between Quaid and resistance fighter Melina to solve a puzzle.

Driving levels are high-speed side-scrolling runs, with the player's vehicle moving at a fixed speed.  The player must dodge passing traffic, or blow them apart with weapons. If they survive to the end, they must defeat a mobile "boss" vehicle to end the level.  Cutscenes appear between certain levels that tell the plot of the movie and set up the next scene.</desc>

The princess you saved back then has taken up a sword and joined your cause! Now, it's more than a death match. You have to explore the many tunnels in his dungeon, defeat the dangerous monsters that come between you and put cold steel to Drax's throat.

The game has similar game play to the original, but with a different challenge. Various monsters will come and attack you, but you'll need to use different approaches in order to defeat each of them. For example, you can't overhead chop a monster that's shorter than your axe. There are 4 dungeon levels to explore before you reach Drax at the final stage.</desc>
