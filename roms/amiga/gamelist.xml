		<name>1000 Miglia</name>
		<desc>Based around a classic motor car race from either side of the war, 1000 Miglia (literally '1000 miles') is an unusual racing game. You have to progress across Italy through a number of stages in your rickety 20s car. Keeping within time limits at each point is crucial to staying in the game. 

At the beginning of the game, you can choose the spare parts that you will take with yourself in case your car breaks down. You also choose a car and set up the skills for your two drivers; you can distribute points between Skill, Resistance and Mechanics, and choose the driver's favorite part of the race. 

Atmospheric conditions change throughout the race: sometimes the weather will be clear, sometimes you'll have to drive through rain or mist. During the race, your car will sometimes lose a wheel or need other repairs. If this happens, you'll lose a couple of minutes repairing it - as long as you have the appropriate spare part; if you don't have one, it's game over!</desc>

		<path>./20000LeaguesUnderTheSea_v0.4.lha</path>
		<name>20000 Leagues under the Sea</name>
		<desc>The game is based on an 1870 novel by Jules Verne.

On July 5th, 1867 the government decided to launch the famous ship the "Abraham Lincoln", which will leave on the trail of a sea monster. The great French professor Mr. Arronax will also take part in the expedition. The weeks passed without any sign of the monster's presence in the area, when, one day, 300 miles from the shores of Queen Charlotte's Island... three members of the expedition set out on board the Nautilus, a submarine navigated by Captain Nemo. The player takes Anorax's role to find out more.

Most of the game is spent on the Nautilus, which consists of three rooms: the living room, the control room and the library. There the player can manipulate objects and talk to people to receive hints what to do next and the state of the Nautilus. With the map, he influences the route. Sometimes the player leaves the submarine to explore other locations, and respectively solves puzzles to receive more hints or to solve action sequences, e.g., fighting against a shark. 

The game is played in real-time, which means the key to success is being in the right location at the right time. This also results in various possibilities to render the game unwinnable, and causes waiting times. For the same reason, the player also needs to watch Nemo's mood. If he angers Nemo, e.g., by manipulating the ship instruments, he locks the player into his room and valuable time passes. The game is played completely in point &amp; click and has no function to save progress.</desc>

		<name>3001 - O'Connors Fight</name>
		<desc>In 3001: O'Connors Fight, the player takes the role of John O'Connor, one of six space lords which fight for dominance over the space empire. The main playing menu consists of two parts: the space map with all planets (either in animated 3D or a top-down view) and the menu with up to four commands. The basic gist is that the lords need to visit owned planets in order to adjust their production focus: space ships are used to defend planets and fuel is required to move them around the empire.

More planets are acquired by attacking them. The result is calculated automatically and is based on the amount of defending respectively attacking troops. A special case comes into effect when a space lord is currently on the attacked planet: the winner of the fight instantly receives all the loser's planets. A lord is permanently removed from the game after the second personal defeat; the goal is to unite all planets under O'Connor's rule. Sometimes there is an action sequence in which the player has to move the space ship (by clicking on cursor keys) in order to avoid obstacles.</desc>

		<path>./3DConstructionKit_v1.0_1765.lha</path>
		<name>3D Construction Kit</name>
		<desc>3D Construction Kit (US, Canada and Israel release title: Virtual Reality Studio[4]), also known as 3D Virtual Studio, is a utility for creating 3D worlds in Freescape. Developed by Incentive Software and published by Domark, it was released in 1991 on multiple platforms. The game originally retailed for Â£24.99 for the 8-bit version, and Â£49.99 for 16-bit version, in the United Kingdom. A sequel, 3D Construction Kit II, was released in 1992, but only available on Amiga, Atari ST or IBM PC (DOS).

Incentive Software had released games using the Freescape engine before, but with 3D Construction Kit, the company took the concept to a whole new level, giving users the ability to create their own worlds and games. In 3D Construction Kit, interaction with the world is usually limited to a cursor controlled with the keyboard, offering the possibility of interaction with nearby objects.

The kit has a very simple graphical user interface, allowing users to create and manipulate objects within the game's 3D environment. Primitives such as cubes, cuboids and pyramids can be easily created and edited to be scaled and placed on the 3D world. Colours can be selected for individual elements, making the free roaming worlds more varied and complex. The user-created virtual world is divided into areas, reducing the processing power required to render objects. The areas can be as large as the memory allows.

Animations may also be added to the primitives, either by looping or simple moving attributes to objects, to create simple, although seemingly advanced, animations.

In order to make games rather than worlds, 3D Construction Kit also allows for the addition of conditions, using the very simple-to-program Freescape Command Language (FCL). Sensors, animations and interactivity with the elements can be added with relative ease. Players are able to move around the virtual worlds by walking or flying. Elements such as proximity sensors triggering events, enemies making the player appear in another zone of the game when hit, and the ability to activate switches in order to open doors, make the worlds created with 3D Construction Kit come to life and add a level of uncertainty to the gameplay.

The interface of the game is customisable; by adding a 320x200, 16-colour IFF screen created with any image editing program, the games created with this tool could be made to look more professional.</desc>

Seen from a first-person cockpit perspective and utilizing flat-shaded polygonal graphics, waves of aliens advance towards the player and must be destroyed with a laser cannon. Unlike in the originals, the aliens never shoot back: the only danger they pose is that of crashing into the player. If any aliens from a wave survive an attack run by not being destroyed before they pass the player, they will try again and again, until either the entire wave or the player is destroyed. The alien formations change every four waves, but not before a bonus stage involving navigating an asteroid field is passed.</desc>

Both 8-ball (pot your seven colors plus the black to win) and 9-ball (pot the 9-ball with a shot that also hits the lowest remaining ball, whatever that may be) are included.

There are seven skill levels to work through. A trick-shot mode is also included, with 20 pre-set shots. Prior to each match it is possible to bet on the outcome.</desc>

		<name>4th &amp; Inches</name>
		<desc>Like other sports games by Bob Whitehead, 4th &amp; Inches was hailed upon release, combining the action of previous titles with the new feature of strategic play calling. For the first time in a computer football game, players could choose from a number of plays. The player initially designated a formation, and then selected one of five plays based on the formation. These plays included a great number of offensive strategies, including draws, curls, sweeps and long bombs, among others. Defensive tactics equally were varied, with the player being able to choose a defensive formation based on what they thought the opponent would attempt.



The game required the player to select a position to control before the play began while on offense, but were not able to switch control during the action. Because there was a limited area of the field in view at any one time, it occasionally prevented the player from seeing important parts of the play develop. Rather than scrolling smoothly when the player being controlled would reach the edge of the screen, as modern football simulations do, it re-drew the visible section of the field entirely, placing the controlled player in a new position on the screen. While on defense, the player being controlled could not be changed either, but would be automatically selected as the player closest to the offensive ball carrier on each screen redraw.</desc>

All diamonds of that color bordering on the player's territory are annexed, expanding the borders. Whoever first controls more than half of the terrain wins.</desc>

9 Lives is a platform game taking in four levels. The lengths of jumps are variable, depending on how long the joystick is pushed down for. Bonus items to be collected include rotor blades, to allow flight. 

Bob cannot kill his enemies, but can temporarily stun them, by hurling his ball of string at them. Contact with enemies or hazards causes an energy bar to decrease - a life is lost once it reaches zero. As the title suggests, this can happen eight times before a ninth death ends the game.</desc>

		<desc>This simulation puts you in the cockpit of the A-10 Thunderbolt II, which is also known as the "Warthog". As the game's name implies, it is used mainly to hunt enemy tanks, but also for destroying roads and bridges

You are armed with 30mm Avenger cannon which can fire around 70 times a second. Multiple camera angles are featured. Landing is automated and an accelerated time function is on offer.

Characters have full AI to act without your involvement, and will communicate with you in-flight. Actions in one mission affect another - something you failed to destroy in one mission can attack you later.</desc>

This is located inside a building, and to find the right one you must continuously smash them up, using either the ogre's horn or the dragon's tail. Humans must also be attacked as you see them, as their catapults weaken you. Food can be found to restore energy,

Once you have located the egg, a one-on-one beat 'em up battle with your rival ensues - win five of these to finally win the game.</desc>

		<desc>In this dungeon-crawling RPG you must assemble a team of four brave fighters to launch an attack on Pendugmalhe, and save the kingdom of Kalynthia. The main gameplay is influenced by Dungeon Master, but features sections in the open air battling bears as well as the dungeons.

In the real-time combat sections you must choose weapons and spells instantaneously, using the mouse-based interface. You will find many villages along the way, and you can gain clues and buy supplies at these. The game's difficulty is pitched at experienced role-players; ideally those with an experienced party from the first game to load in.</desc>

		<desc>In this RPG, you play the role of four heroes whose mission is to save their world, Kalynthia, from the evil arch mage Bronagh. Most of the time, while exploring the over world, the game is shown in a 2D top-down view. It gives you much freedom: there's more to do than just stick to the main quest. Towns have a static interface where you reach the wished location by pressing the according symbol. e.g. a church for healing up or a sage for hints.

During dungeon crawls the game switches to a 3D view and plays similar to Dungeon Master. As usual for this kind of games you see the dungeon in a small windows while your characters are shown on the right hand side of the screen. Dungeon sequences are completely in real-time. This includes combat which basically consists of clicking on a character's weapon or magic spell and then clicking on the monster. After every usage of a weapon/spell you have to wait a certain time until you can use it again.</desc>

		<desc>Pete Cooke's follow-up to the previous space shooter-explorer takes things away from the Tau Ceti setting. Players take the role of a student at an academy for advanced piloting. There they need to solve 20 simulated missions on a wide range of planets.

The self-contained missions mean that the game uses the Tau Ceti structure and theme, without the causality of previous decisions having an effect on later choices. This reduces the complexity of management. Although players can customize the ships, including giving them names of your choice, the game comes with supplied ones include a variety that should suit many different circumstances.

Whichever vehicle is chosen, players will control it from a 1st person perspective and a series of controls. All ships skim over the surface of the planet and feature weapons. Most missions will involve destroying rogue robots enemies. Players will have to dock with buildings to refuel or move on to a different planet.</desc>

		<desc>This is a top down vertically scrolling shooter, in which you start off as a motorbike. You are quite vulnerable to attack at first, but power ups come in the form of a Sega van which you have to dock with. The first time you dock you get double fire, the second time gives you a rocket, the third gives a rear force field and the fourth invulnerablility.

By destroying cars and bikes that appear on your way, you can collect A-F letters. Collecting A through to D allows you change into a sportscar which is less vulnerable to attack, but not as nimble. Collect all the letters in order to be able to transform into a high tech plane. This is the final stage of one of the five missions. Only the high tech plane can guide you to your destination in which your main target is hiding.

There is also time limit in which you have to complete the mission. It is advisable to transform into the high tech plane as fast as it is possible.

Picking up flags gives you bonus points with 10,000 points gaining you an extra life.</desc>

The game takes place towards the end of the movie: the Addams Family has been evicted from their home by a court order issued by a backstabbing attorney (there's one for the books), Tully Alford. Even worse, the other Addamses: Morticia, Pugsley, Wednesday, Granny and Lurch have gone missing.

As Gomez, you must tour the Addams mansion in search of your lost family, battling out mysterious monsters and evading traps, and eventually face your nemesis, Tully.</desc>

Naturally all the grown-ups get in the way by making him go to school, making him clean his room, etc. But now that's school's out for the summer, Willy is determined to have a good time and maybe even have his pet frog win the frog jumping contest. However Willy has a habit of getting into trouble, and naturally that means it will be a challenge to get out of it.

The Adventures of Willy Beamish is a point-and-click graphical adventure. You play Willy Beamish, an eight year-old kid who is just trying to get through life without losing his lunch money. But he'll have to deal with parents, teachers, babysitters and bratty sisters. The player must solve different puzzles to ensure Willy can progress, get out of trouble and generally avoid ending up grounded. 

The in-game time progresses even if no action is taken. This means many puzzles have to be solved in a certain time frame or rely on being in the right place at the right time. A special aspect of this game is a bar which shows Willy's relationship to his parents. It gets affected by the way certain situations are resolved, e.g. it increases if Willy refuses to play with his sister, and when it is full they send Willy to a military school and the game is lost.</desc>

		<desc>The game tries to represent the African part of 11th Paris-Dakar rally route, which in the game takes place in Tunisia, Algeria, Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Senegal in 1988-1989.

Controlling his(her) car in third-person 'behind the car' view, player should drive through the marked path in Sahara. When player loses his(her) way, he(she) may be in the sands alone and start to skid. In this situation he(she) may switch between 4x4 and 4x2 modes of the car. These modes have own opportunities and misses. The speed is limited to 87 in 4x4 mode and limited by car's parameters in 4x2 mode. But in 4x4 mode path marks may stop the car, while in 4x2 mode the car may knock the path parks off. Switching the gear, player may drive back and forth to avoid blocking of car either by path mark or by debris in the sand. Direction of the way is shown by compass as well as length of traversed path and volume of residuary fuel are displayed by indicators.

Other drivers are present on the way during day and night, therefore they should be left behind to win in the rally. There are five stages with different visible horizons:
1) Tunis - In Salah (5726 Km); 
2) Ouallene - Achegour (4353 Km); 
3) Achegour - Niamey (4587 Km); 
4) Ouagadougou - Bamako  (4438 Km); 
5) Bamako - Dakar (3622 Km).

So, you have to conquer the sands of Sahara, show good time on each stage, and to be the first at the finish.</desc>

This aircraft has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons (basically machine guns). In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all the time.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.</desc>

Out of the ashes comes a hero, Jonathan Rogers, better known as "Jungle Rogers", the owner of the asphalt jungle. The only chance of survival is to reach the airdrop platform XV-238, located in the control base of the schizophrenic assassin professor McJerin, and to escape to outer colonies.

There is no easy way to do this. The game is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up, with thugs coming at you constantly, and a few moves to use on them. You must cross the dangerous streets of Manhattan, which have become over-run by feral thieves. Later you await the guardians of the scientific complex of McJerin.</desc>

		<desc>You have been turned into a ball of air with a slow leak by an evil wizard. You must find the Spellbook and the ingredients for the spell. Without these, you will never turn back into a human again.

These items have to be collected in the maze which consists of 150 isometric rooms. These can be explored freely but sometimes you need to have special objects to proceed, e.g. a candle in dark rooms. The dangers consist mostly of sharp objects which can cause your ball to burst. Additionally you are on a timer because your balloon loses air constantly. But it can be refilled by using pumps which can be found in the maze - but you have to leave them in time or you explode because of overpressure.</desc>

		<desc>In this action/simulation game by Microprose the player takes the role of an U.S. Army airborne ranger. These Airborne rangers are dropped behind enemy lines by parachute to perform all kinds of dangerous missions. Gameplay consists of 3 phases:

    Reading the mission briefing and outfitting 3 supply pods with machine gun ammo, time bombs, first-aid kits, grenades &amp; LAW rockets depending on this briefing.
    Flying over the mission map in a V-22 Osprey plane to drop your 3 supply pods and parachuting out of the plane yourself.
    Performing the actual missions and reaching the pick-up point before time runs out. There are 12 different missions which include capturing an enemy officer, blowing up an ammunition depot, photographing an experimental aircraft and liberating P.O.W.'s

Missions take place in either an arctic, desert or temperate setting. Using the mission map the player must decide the route towards the mission objective. This might require them to crawl through trenches, run around minefields or take out enemy soldiers and bunkers. Airborne Ranger was one of the first games with some missions that required a stealthy approach (staying undetected until a certain time, taking out a guard and stealing an enemy uniform etc.).

Airborne Ranger can be played in practice or veteran mode. In practice mode, gameplay is limited to a single mission, while in veteran mode, a series of missions or an entire campaign is played in order to earn medals &amp; promotions. All missions can be played on several difficulty levels.</desc>

In the first few levels you have to guide the main character Kaneda through an obstruction filled road on his motorcycle. Obstacles come in the form of roadblocks, holes in the road, which must be jumped with the use of a ramp, and a variety of characters on the road who throw bombs at you. The roadblocks can only be cleared by grenades which you pick up by knocking over traffic cones. You must also make it to the end of the level without running out of fuel.

After the motorcycle levels there are five platform levels. The object of these levels is basically to kill everyone you come in contact with, each kill adding to a meter which you have to fill to complete the level.</desc>

The player controls Aladdin, who must make his way through several levels based on locations from the movie: from the streets and rooftops of Agrabah, the Cave of Wonders and the Sultan's dungeon to the final confrontation in Grand Vizier Jafar's palace. The Sultan's guards and also animals of the desert want to hinder Aladdin in his way. He can defend himself with his sword or by throwing apples. Next to apples, Aladdin can also collect gems which can be traded for lives and continues with a traveling trader. Finding Genie or Abu icons enables bonus rounds. The Genie bonus round is a game of luck played for apples, gems or extra lives. In Abu's bonus round, the player controls the little monkey who has to catch bonus items that fall from the sky, but without touching any of the unwanted objects like rocks and pots.

The game's humorous animations were created by Walt Disney Feature Animation.</desc>

Outside, the goal is to reach the building in which the objectives have to be completed. Of course the baron's thugs are not too pleased and try to kill the hero - so he has to shoot back with a many different weapons, e.g. flamethrowers, machine guns, bombs, and other destructive or close combat weapons, which can be collected from dead enemies. Similarly to Hostage: Rescue Mission, he can also hide in the background in certain spots.

Once inside a building, the game switches to a first-person view, in which the player has to navigate a maze to reach his goal, e.g. recovering evidence. To his disposal are a radar and a rifle.</desc>

Thus, it crash lands on the prison colony planet Fiorina 161. Ripley and the unarmed prisoners have to figure out a way to survive the aliens terrorizing the colony until help arrives.

The gameplay of the various Alien³ conversions varies from platform to platform. This version is a side-scrolling action game with large maze-like levels. In each level, you have to rescue all the trapped prisoners and then make your way to the exit, all while surviving multiple alien attacks.</desc>

		<desc>Alien Bash II is a top-down shooter similar to The Chaos Engine (in contrast to the predecessor which is more like Alien Breed). After a planet was attacked by aliens and enslaved their inhabitants, the player takes the role of an escaped prisoner who tries clean up the mess.

While moving through the maze-like environments, the player shoots a lot of aliens and has to solve a few basic puzzles (usually switch puzzles or finding keys) in order to open up the way to proceed. Some of those are optional and open up bonus areas with power-ups (e.g. additional life-energy or extra weapons like grenades) and money. The latter can be also earned by killing enemies and is used between levels to buy the mentioned extras in a shop. The goal of each of the eight levels is to first free all hostages (a radar shows the general way) and then kill the end boss who always the same with different attacks. There are three control options to choose from which determine how the player character behaves while shooting, e.g. it allows to shoot while moving or while spinning on the spot.</desc>

		<desc>To be honest with you, Alien Bash is the sort of game that you can pick up and play without reading any instructions, it's that simple. Anyway, for those of you who are initiative-challenged will be pleased to know that the full instructions are coming up after this break.
Break.
Right, you play a nippy nameless young fellow who has to fend off hoards of alien scum-bag weakling no-brained slime-buckets using only your initiative. Oh, and a gun. By running around the spaceship (using the joystick) and avoiding anything which looks remotely harmless, you've got to free a set number of hostages from every level. These prisoners are encapsulated inside a lethal force-field which needs to be blasted away before you can run in and collect the stranded bods. Once you've managed to free all the prisoners in the level, make your way back to where you started from and you'll be whisked away to the next challenge.
Before you rush off and begin to blast things willy-nilly, it's worth mentioning that you cannot fire unless the joystick is pointing in one of the eight directions, so you either have to run towards the alien scumbag weakling no-brained slime-buckets whilst firing or centre the joystick, push FIRE and then move the joystick in whichever direction you wish to shoot.
There are simply loads of power-ups (revealed by destroying the funny looking shapes) to collect along the way, which vary from triple shot to super-hard death-inducing missiles which wipeout aliens with one hit. Brilliant! Also, there's a nifty invincibility token which renders you... yeah, you should know the routine by now.</desc>

The story is directly connected to the ending of the predecessor: after a hard day's work the protagonist gets rescued by a space cruiser. But unfortunately shortly after an alien ship crosses their path and kidnaps the crew - now the player has 16 new levels to progress through in one-player mode. The action offers the usual DOOM-inspired gameplay: shooting everything in sight by using the ten weapons with limited ammo and searching for key cards. The enemies are working together and trying to adjust their approach depending on which of the many weapons the player is armed with.

There is no music within the levels, just ambient sounds. A level editor is provided, which is especially useful for the two-player game.</desc>

Gameplay involves walking from left to right, shooting at the various enemies that appear in the player's path and jumping between platforms to find the right route and avoid falling into a pit. Enemies range from regular aliens, armoured ones, aliens riding strange vehicles to more abstract flying things. Sometimes potions appear from killed aliens, which can be either green or red. If the player touches a green potion he regains some health but if he touches a red one he loses some. When all out of health, one of three lives is lost.</desc>

		<name>Alien Storm</name>
		<desc>Alien Storm is a side-scrolling beat 'em up.[2] The game resembles Golden Axe, with a similar artistic style, three playable characters (a man, a woman, and a novelty character) and pick-up or power-up special attacks. The player (one player only on the Master System version, up to two players on the Mega Drive version, three on the arcade version) selects from the three different characters to embark upon a quest to save the Earth from an alien invasion.

All of the Busters are playable from the beginning of the game. There are nine missions to complete (eight in the Mega Drive version) with several stages, and each mission has the player blasting aliens, from the streets to the mother ship, where the mother of all aliens can be found. This task becomes increasingly difficult with each new mission, and the aliens are capable of hiding inside objects such as plants, postboxes, trashcans, drums, and other items. Each mission has an objective such as rescuing people or destroying an UFO.

After defeating certain aliens, flying heads will appear, which can be shot to collect life or energy. Energy is used specifically to power the energy based attacks of the player's weapon (such as flames or electricity) and to use the much more powerful special weapons.

In a similar format as other early Sega arcade games, each character has unlimited usage of various short-range attacks, i.e. punches, kicks. Along with these standard attacks, each character has their own individual weapon (Garth's weapon that shoots lightning is replaced with a flame weapon in the Master System version). Special attacks are also included, and vary depending on the character chosen at the start of the game. For instance, Garth summons an U.S. Air Force starship that drops bombs across the street (in the Master System version he has Karen's special, a ballistic missile strike). Scooter will teleport out of his present location and leave a series of bombs that will blow up on the appearance of aliens, after which he will re-appear (in the Mega Drive version he just explodes, leaving his head, which his new body returns to retrieve). Karen calls down a nuclear missile, which incinerates every foe on the screen. However, a large amount of energy is depleted by using each character's special attack, and cannot be used if the energy of the player's character is too low.

There are few bosses in the game. The arcade original only features a single boss in the middle of the game that has three dis</desc>

		<desc>You, Kai are about to marry your sweetheart Medb, but Slough Feg and his minions have kidnapped her and taken her to the far side of The Cave of Dreams. Swearing a bit too loud about rescuing her, Slough Feg has heard you and turned you into an insect. With the help of magic from the Druid Lords though, you set off on your quest.

To help you, some minions leave behind either a power-up for your weapon or Zen, the currency of The Cave of Dreams. Zen can be spent in the shops that litter the landscape. Here you can buy health or extra weapons. Kai has three lives which are lost when his two energy dots turn from white, cycle through various colours before turning black.

Alien World is a scrolling shoot-em-up. Various levels scroll horizontally while others scroll vertically. The screen will only scroll when you move so far across the screen. You cannot re-trace your steps. As well as the main playing area you can also see your score, amount of Zen, Energy dots, lives and various weapons. The joystick moves Kai, but not touching the joystick lets gravity kick in. The fire button fires your weapon.</desc>

		<desc>In Aliex, the player takes the role of a space pilot who was shot down over a planet. The good news is that the crash-landing was not instantly deadly. The bad news is that the enemy sends in their whole force to kill the player for good.

The game requires a lightgun which is used to shoot the numerous enemies appearing on the screen. There are a few enemy types which need more or less hits to be defeated; some of them unleash powerful attacks when they are not disposed of within a certain time frame. Of course the other enemies are also able to damage the player's life energy and running out causes death. Along with ammo, it can be refilled by shooting packages which drop in after a certain amount of points are earned. The background (first desert, then jungle) automatically scrolls from left to right and than back; the goal is to survive this ordeal often enough.</desc>

		<desc>One of the few computer games recreating cricket, the traditional summer pastime in many English-speaking countries. The game had different licenses with well-known cricketers in different countries. It was Audiogenic's second cricket game, 8 years after Graham Gooch's Test Match.

All the international sides are present, with the chance to change the player data and choose the team yourself. Test match and limited-overs matches are available, with 1 or 2 innings per team, and you can turn the Leg-before-wicket dismissal off, which makes the game easier to understand.

There are 3 skill levels - Amateur, Professional and World Class. The bowling involves positioning a cursor to place the bowl, then controlling the speed/spin (depending on the type of bowler selected). Batting involves timing one of the many available shots, and fielding is largely automated.</desc>

		<desc>Alpha Waves is a 3D game viewed from third-person perspective. The player pilots a "Mobile", a craft which bounces off of the platforms that fill the rooms. The player can rotate the craft left and right, thrust it forward, and move the camera up and down for optimal viewing. The game contains 256 rooms, which the player explores while in search of 16 crystals and 16 cubes. The Mobile bounces from platform to platform, making its way around the room to the doors that lead into other rooms. On the way, the player encounters many other creatures and vehicles, as well as surprises, such as rooms with reversed gravity.

There are two modes of play: Emotion and Action.

    In Action, players start in the central room, and work their way around with a time limit. Players gain time when going into a room they haven't been in before, and when crystal or cube power-ups are picked up. When time runs out, the Mobile explodes and the game ends.
    In Emotion, players can choose to start in any of the 12 regions into which the 256 rooms are grouped. The regions are arranged in the context of different areas of the human brain. While there is no timer, players also can't explore beyond the region that is chosen.</desc>

The Altered Beast title refers to your shapeshifting abilities. In this platformer, you can collect spirit balls by defeating two-headed wolves, allowing you to mutate into different beasts such as a werewolf, a dragon, a tiger, a bear and others depending on the version. Each form, tied to a level, comes with special abilities such as flight and powerful attacks, easily superseding the basic set of punches and kicks in your human form.

The game can be played in single player mode, or in same-screen multiplayer co-op mode.</desc>

No big deal? Quite on the contrary. When the unsuspecting Mr. Barrett returns home and turns the TV on, he is sucked into a portal! One moment later he finds himself on the strange planet of Daltere. Naturally, this planet needs a savior: the evil alien Helmar has stolen an artifact known as the Jewel of Light, thus endangering the entire galaxy. Now our unlikely hero has to overcome various obstacles and to save the world.

Altered Destiny is a puzzle-solving adventure game. The interface is very similar to the one used in Les Manley games by the same company. The navigation can be done with the mouse (point-and-click), but the game still requires text input to issue commands to the hero and to interact with the world.</desc>

		<desc>Ambermoon is the second game in Thalion's never-finished Amber trilogy that was started out by Amberstar. The sequel is set more than half a century after the first game, the world of Lyramion just starting to recover from the destruction caused by the collapse of the red moon. The original protagonist is an old, dying man as the game starts out. He summons his grandchild and tells him about a vision he had, of an old friend who supposedly died more than forty years ago and warned him of a great evil rising again. He sends the youth on a quest to seek that old friend and find out what is behind that vision.

Concerning gameplay, Ambermoon is similar to its predecessor. The player initially controls only the main character, having the choice between a male and a female protagonist with several portraits each, but otherwise unable to customize them at that point. During the course of the game, additional characters may be recruited in various places in Lyramion; up to six form an active party that participates in combat. All characters can train physical attributes by specific NPCs in various towns, while some can also buy, learn, and cast offensive, supportive, and healing magic spells.</desc>

		<desc>Amberstar is a role-playing game which uses a top-down view for overworld travel and most indoor locations, and switches to a first-person pseudo-3D perspective when exploring cities and dungeons. Initially the player creates a single protagonist with randomly assigned attributes and no class designation. During the course of the game, additional characters (up to six active party members) can be found in different cities and other locations and recruited. Some of these characters already belong to established classes and come with their own abilities. Guilds of various classes (fighter, paladin, ranger, mage, monk, and thief) can be visited, where the protagonist and his class-less companions (if any) can be promoted. Choice of classes affects attributes, character growth, imposes equipment restrictions, etc. When leveling up, characters can train in specific locations, increasing attributes of the player's choice.</desc>

		<name>Amegas</name>
		<desc>Amegas is a Breakout variant which conforms to, and expands on the play mechanics of the established Arkanoid canon. 

The basic lay remains to control a bat which slides back and forth at the bottom of the screen. Stacks of coloured bricks are arranged in patterns above. The object is being to bounce a ball to hit the bricks to make them disappear. Some bricksâ€™ require multiple hits to destroy - visually indicated by dots shown on the face. Some special bricks are distinguished from others by unique icons, e.g. one with aâ€™ skullâ€™ will result in a loss of life if hit by the ball, or one with an â€˜xâ€™ mark will cause new bricks to spawn &amp; spread. 

At times bricks will yield colour-coded pickups which topple down and may be caught, resulting in a special power-up feature being given. A unique play facet presented here is that power-upsâ€™ are not activated automatically, but rather are reserved - The player may utilise the last power-up collected upon clicking the right mouse button, this remains true even if a ball is lost.</desc>

Each player selects two wrestlers from those on offer, and when the one in the ring is weakened he can go to the edge of the ring and tag his team-mate, who then enters the ring and allows the other to recover.

You can either play individual matches (for one or two players) or a full tournament, with three rounds of variable length. There is no joystick-waggling in the control system, with a variety of kicks, throws and punches on offer using simple joystick motions. Once the players are close together they grapple - this gives you a chance to lift and then piledrive your opponent.</desc>

		<desc>After naval combat, the second sequel to The Ancient Art of War is all about aircraft combat in World War I. It is a real-time strategy game in nature, and most of the time is spent on the overhead map. Here players plan their strategy and set the goals and routes for their aircraft. There are various statistics which are affected by the happenings on the battle field, e.g. destroying factories lengthen the time the enemy can get new aircraft. Overall the game features many real and fictional campaigns, as well as an editor to create more, with the winning condition to either destroy the enemy's flight force, his capital city or wearing him out.

When a flight battle or bombing occurs, the game switches to a side-scrolling combat screen. Here players actively participate in the combat; during dog fights the goal is to destroy the enemy and bombings are a matter of releasing the bomb at the right time while avoiding flak fire. Those sequences can be automatically calculated by the computer; then the pilot's skills affect his changes of success.</desc>

		<name>Antago</name>
		<desc>Antago is a puzzle game played on a 5x5 square board. It can be played either against the computer, with a choice of up to 10 levels of difficulty, or against another human player. Other options allow you to play a match or start a training session, as well as select between "plain" (empty board) and "prepared" (pre-arranged balls on the board) game modes. A demo mode is also available, where the computer plays against itself.

An angel and a devil compete against each other, with the goal of aligning five "balls" in a row on the board, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. They are moved around the board with the joystick, pushing each other as their paths cross, and strategically placing balls on the edge of the board to both disrupt their opponent's lines and try to create a line of 5 of their own balls.

Each level features different background and board graphics. There is no background music playing during the game, and only basic sound effects when the two characters push each other, place a ball on the board and win.</desc>

		<name>Apache Flight</name>
		<desc>Apache Flight is a vertically scrolling shooter in which the player spends the most time shooting enemies by using the two available weapons: the unlimited standard ammo (released by tapping the fire button) and limited missiles (released by holding the fire button) which are required to hit ground targets, e.g. cannons and tanks. Those missiles are also available in the heat-seeking variety which are automatically used up first. Fuel is limited and is constantly drained every second, but it can be refilled by hovering over fuel depots which are regularly encountered during the levels. However, when shooting them with a missile instead, the depot releases additional missiles to collect. Of course it is also important to dodge enemies and their bullets because every hit causes the loss of a life. When that happens, a new helicopter with reset fuel and missiles appears with a brief invincibility period at the point of death. The game is lost when all lives are gone.</desc>

Gameplay scrolls sideways and is platform based, with a very cutesy and consolesque look, and 17 levels, each containing an extra hidden section. Each level has its own elemental setting, taking in the fires of Hell and the clouds and light of Heaven. The levels are full of boxes, which can be used as weapons by kicking them at enemies.

As you go you can also collect money, which can be spent in shops to buy useful extras. Many collectibles and other items exist, such as leaves (which change the effects of gravity, allowing you to jump higher and stay hanging in the air for longer), extra lives, fruit for bonus points, and balloons allowing a degree of vertical movement.</desc>

		<desc>In Aquanaut, the protagonist has to find and kill the leader of an alien race which wants to destroy Earth. This alien is smart and is not easy to find, but humanity managed to track him down to an underwater location in the Caribbean. The game is divided into three levels with distinctive different gameplay mechanics.

The first level is a traditional, horizontally scrolling shooter. The protagonist, equipped with diving gear, has to make his way to the alleged position of the alien ship. Enemies are mutated underwater animals which are shot with the harpoon. There are also friendly creatures like dolphins and mermaids (their kiss gives an extra life) and military crates which contain additional gear. Air is limited and has to be refilled at certain parts of the level.

In level two, the player has to investigate an underwater maze. He needs to find and grab various items which are used at another place to proceed. This section is puzzle-oriented and the action concentrates on obstacles which need to be avoided and single enemies.

Level three is also a maze in which objects need to be found (a decoder and keys) which need to be brought to a final location. However, it is set on land (Atlantis, to be exact) and therefore air is no longer an issue. The fights take a "run and gun" approach where the player shoots a lot of aliens and dodges their attacks. In this section the game flips the screen when another room is entered.</desc>

This game saw Pond and friends competing in the underwater Olympics.



The events take the form of various mini-games, usually in the same vein as Hyper Sports, but with an aquatic theme and the humour seen in the James Pond series (e.g. The 100 Metre Splash). More unusual mini-games include Kipper Watching, which involves 'heading' incoming beach balls away from a troop of sleeping seals, and Gymnastics. Events can be played with up to 4 players.</desc>

		<desc>After a nuclear war, Earth's population is mostly wiped out. The survivors have build eight underwater colonies - that's all what left from humanity. Unfortunately, the nuclear war was just the beginning. An alien race, the Spurcians, made advantage from this situation. So they've conquered Earth and have taken those eight cities. Now the only survivors are inside the freight vessel Genesite, which is in orbit. On a last attempt to free the underwater colonies, the pilot Josh Aldrin (you) is send back. Meanwhile, the Spurcians destroyed the freight vessel, making you the last human on Earth. So, you are now on revenge...

Your job is now to flight with your craft above the water surface. Destroying enemy alien crafts and energy generators. When you destroyed enough generators, the energy shield from the main pyramid fails, and you can attack the level guardian. Once he is destroyed, you use the tunnel, which connects the underwater colonies, to get to the next one. You will play all eight colonies. While in the tunnel, you have the chance to collect power-ups to regenerate your ships energy (health). Inside a level, you have to live with the energy you currently have. Oh, and by the way, you have, like in reality, only a single life.</desc>

There are nine levels in the game. In several levels, there are various gameplay elements which include flying on the magic carpet and racing against your opponent in a mine cart. You will also meet some characters, which if you give them an item they want, they will give you something in return.
 
In other levels, you have to do things yourself. For example, obtain a snake that will set a prisoner free, or using a blow torch to open some frozen doors.

		<name>Arachnophobia</name>
		<desc>Arachnophobia is a Platform game, developed by Blue Sky Software and published by Disney Interactive Studios, which was released in 1991.

This arcade type game has you as an exterminator who must kill the infestation of spiders that have invaded the towns. When you find the queen and kill it, you can then go to the next town to do your extermination.

Each town consists of about 15 houses all of which are infested with spiders but only one house has the queen. You enter the house of your choice and walk through each room killing all the spiders. You are armed with poison that you squirt on the spiders to kill them. You can also jump on them squishing them but this is more risky because itâ€™s easier for you to get bitten. Get bitten 3 times and you will die. You also have a can of super poison. Pressing the spacebar releases the can of poision and can kill all the spiders in a room. You only have a limited number of these so you must use them sparingly. If you kill all the spiders in the house you are congratulated by sampled speech and put back into the neighborhood ready to enter the next house.

The graphics are decent and the sound is very good. There is some humorous sampled speech throughout the game. The game plays extremely well and the difficulty level is perfect. The game gets harder with each town that you go to.

In conclusion, this is a very good and fun game. The game has a very cartoony feel to it but it also feels realistic in many ways. I really canâ€™t say anything bad about this game, so this game gets a definite thumbs up! Very playable + very funny, + very fun = very good game!</desc>

Each side plays as an Adept - a powerful wizard with the ability to cast spells against other Adepts and his summonings - and must defeat the other side, either Chaos or Order, by attacking him/her with summoned Elementals or Demons. Each side can summon 4 unique elementals at a time or choose from 4 demons, common to both.

Gameplay is similar to the original, reminiscent of a chess-like board game, requiring strategy, but with arcade elements, especially when two adepts confront each other face-to-face. The board also shifts from time to time, making the strategy less predictable.</desc>

Up to four players can compete in the events, but not playing at the same time, but in a hot-seat mode. Control is like in other sports games: you have to gain speed pushing the joystick in a perfect rhythm, and pushing the trigger at the right time, i.e. to start jumping in the Long Jump and High Jump discipline.
Unlike other games of the genre, humor is not getting short, as a referee is constantly pestering at you, making sarcastic comments if you fail to reach very good results. Most events are visually presented on several screens which are flipped (not scrolled).</desc>

A long time period passed and the dimension controlling force Doh has again come back to life. Occupying the huge starship Xorg, it has entered our universe from a different dimension. Mixtec, Arkanoid type spaceship, has lauched the craft Vaus II to make a preemptive attack on Xorg.</desc>

The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.</desc>

The game is controlled by a point and click interface where you can check messages, deploy satellites and troops, send food to the regions which need it, and spy on nations. You will regularly get messages that a country is deploying forces or increasing its diplomatic presence in another nation, and can show support or criticism for these. Be aware that these decisions have consequences - the 16 nations all have feelings of importance and would not want to be sidelined.</desc>

		<desc>Armalyte: The Final Run, like its C64 namesake, is a traditional side-scrolling shoot'em up heavily inspired by R-Type, giving the player's spaceship the task of traversing five levels. The starting setup is a simple forward-facing shot as well as a power shot that must be charged by holding on to the fire button. Upgrades are a forward-facing three-way, a vertical two-way, or the addition of a single backwards shot (only one of the three at time). Also available are pods that attach to the ship and fire a forwards laser, and, only in the final level, self-homing missiles.

The levels not only feature many enemy formations, but also environmental hazards, like drops of acid or falling stalactites. On one occasion, the scrolling speeds up, making the level a hazard course. Each stage ends with the customary end boss.</desc>

The game involves lots of resource management, as the neccessities to build equipment must be mined, new designs must be researched, and factory facilities are required to build them. Pre-defined missions are also handed out, including capturing strategic points and delivering resources.

The actual battles take place manually 3D, with multiple units under your control at a time, although you switch between them rather than controlling them all at once as in the Team Yankee series. The vehicles on offer include tanks, planes, hovercrafts and helicopters, all handling in considerable depth. If you have a spare Amiga, a null-modem cable and a friend, he/she can control units at the same time to help you out.</desc>

Still, now you're in the Special Operations Corps (SOC), you've been sent on a well dangerous mission to steal information from the enemy. You must fight your way over a bridge in your jeep, through air defences in your helicopter and finally, on foot into the headquarters themselves proclaiming yourself a hero! OK, OK and a 'well 'ard geezer' if that's what you want...

The level of gameplay in Army Moves is so minimal that it annoys me to think that people may have paid out big bucks just so that they can practise holding down the fire button and religiously going through two joystick movement patterns. The slightest deviation from the stringent stick manoeuvring results in instant death, and return a trip to the start of the level! So if, after ten minutes' play, you haven't vengefully put the disk under the grill and watched it bubble its way into oblivion, you'll be slumped over your joystick dreaming of happier times. I regret the loss to the world's natural resources caused by the production of this utterly awful 'game'.</desc>

It is the sequel to the Amiga / C64 platform game Arnie (1992). Unlike the previous title it has been developed in-house by Zeppelin

Fast reflexes and a lust for violence are required for success here. Your average muscleman shoots and bombs his way through four enemy-infested territories: Shut down a chemical plant by blowing up enough pipeline valves. Clear an airfield from enemy soldiers, tanks and helicopters. Climb from battleship to battleship in a hostile harbor. And finally, rescue as many prisoners as possible from a jungle POW camp.

Naturally, the levels are crawling with enemies: from simple infantry armed with rifles, mortars or rocket launchers to MG teams, missile batteries and tanks. Most of the opponents are stationary and stolidly fire in a single direction; however, foxholes spew out cannon-fodder at a constant rate. To destroy such nests or efficiently dispatch groups of soldiers, Arnie has a (limited) supply of grenades. Some deceased foes drop more powerful weapons as well as invaluable first aid kits and extra lives.</desc>

While those sections are all strategic, there are also some vector-based combat sections. These ensure that brawns are required along with brains, and give the game some variety.</desc>

		<desc>Atomix is a puzzle video game developed by GÃ¼nter KrÃ¤mer (as "Softtouch") and published by Thalion Software, released for the Commodore Amiga and other personal computers in late 1990.

On each level, you are given a couple of atoms, and your task is to arrange them into a specific molecule.

You see all the atoms available for you to move in a top-down view. Down below on the left side is a small preview of what you must get. That picture represents a molecular structure that you must recreate by moving atoms horizontally and/or vertically. Once you move an atom, it won't stop unless it hits an obstacle, like a wall, or another atom, therefore you must use walls and other atoms creatively.

The game contains 30 levels, and you have a limited time for each level.</desc>

		<path>./AtomSmasher_v1.0.lha</path>
		<name>Atomsmasher</name>
		<desc>The basic idea behind this one comes from Pengo, with a maze containing various arrangements of blocks as well as several baddies, who are all one square in size. You kill them by firing blocks at them, which carry on moving until they hit a bad guy (in which case both are destroyed and you get some points) or another block (in which case it comes to a stop). The way the level layouts change as you play allows you to potentially box in some enemies, so you can deal with them gradually.

There are also exploding bad guys (drawn as Lemmings), so watch out for the warning as they prepare. Some blocks are icy, meaning that they can't be pushed, and they destroy any block that hits them. Collectible power ups include a short-term baddy-freeze and short-term invincibility. There's a co-operative 2-player mode, in which you can, unusually, harm your team-mate.

An extremely sophisticated editor was tucked away in the game, allowing you to not only design a maze and position the baddies (including regenerating ones, set to come in at any interval), but also change their speed and how frequently they fire hazards out.</desc>

		<desc>Australo Piticus Mechanicus is a platform game exclusively published on the Amiga. The player has to guide the protagonist named Androids van Laptop on his journey to rescue his lost maiden.

The game itself flips screens, no scrolling is involved. In melee combat you can hit with your sword (if you have one), or throw stones if you want to stay at distance. Weapons can be purchased at shops, which are placed frequently on the platforms. During your way, you collect money and gems to stock up for better weapons. You can jump, take objects (especially keys), use objects, and often ladders have to be climbed. The game character has two attributes: hit points, representing the health, and strength, which defines how much damage the player's character is doing to enemies and is defined by the equipment and weapon the character is carrying.

There are eight levels. Beside the platform game, there is a futuristic gag: directly after loading the game you can decide not to enter the game, but the "system". The system is a text-based Unix-like console, in which by typing commands a Space Invaders game and some pictures of the developers can be found.</desc>

The game is set in a futuristic version of USA, where gangs and vigilantes rule the wilderness, and people's only protection are armored cars with mounted weaponry. The player is cast in the role of an average person who must at first earn enough money to buy an own car, and then perform courier missions throughout the country.

The game's progression is fairly open-ended: the player is free to visit different cities, explore highways, participate in car Arena battles to earn money, take on gangsters in the wilderness, salvage car parts, etc. A few courier missions must be completed in order to advance the story. The player can construct and customize vehicles using guns, mine-layers, smokescreens, oil slicks, rockets and other accessories, choosing between various body and chassis types for the car. The entire game is viewed from a top-down perspective.</desc>

You have to steer your character through seven absolutely different levels. In every level new deadly perils lurk for the hero. The first is probably the most famous level. Left and right are some not exactly friendly meaning Aztecs, which welcome you with spears. You either have to duck under the spear or jump over it (depending on the height the spear is coming at). If you get hit you have to start again. In the later levels you have to avoid stones, poisonous scorpions and snakes and get over a bridge.</desc>

Armadas of hostile UFOs shoot fire balls at you from every direction. Your aiming reticle is in the centre of the display, and is surrounded by circular radar, which is formed by a series of small white dots, within this are numerous red dots which represent the UFO enemies. You are dealt an initial five lives, and you score points for each UFO destroyed. The game features environmental effects, such as day time turning to night, and vice versa.</desc>

Marty McFly and Doc Brown have traveled back through time to the year 1885 - and they're soon deep in trouble when they face "Mad Dog" Tannen's gang and have to find a way to return to the present. This game takes four scenes from the Hollywood movie Back to the Future III and turns them into arcade sequences:

1. Buckboard Chase: Doc Brown goes horseback in an attempt to save Hill Valley's lovely school teacher Clara. This game of quick ducking, jumping and shooting alternates between a side-scrolling and a top-down perspective.

2. Shooting Gallery: The name says it all. A classic game of aim-and-shoot, spiced up by hidden extras and bonus targets.

3. Pie Throwing: Meet the Mad Dog gang. They have guns, and you have... cream pies. It's an isometric version of the shooting gallery, only with ammo. And the targets shoot back.

4. The Train: Basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up on train wagons with some ducking and jumping. Get rid of the mechanics and collect speed logs to push the engine to a magic 88 mph.</desc>

		<desc>The plot of "Bad Company" is quickly told: Earth is dying and mankind needs new worlds to colonize, the Nu-Worlds. You and your (optional) companion have the task to clear those worlds from hostile alien insectoids.

"Bad Company" is played in a pseudo-3D view (third person) that very much resembles that of Space Harrier games.
Before you start to play you'll have to choose one of the eight offered troopers as your player character. This decision will influence gameplay later on, e.g. you won't be able to carry a specific weapon or your character is especially fast, and so on. When it comes to the action you'll be confronted with several different alien types including "level bosses".You battle these foes by using one of the four available weapon systems (equipment can be changed in the course of the game). You have full movement control over your character, meaning the screen isn't auto-scrolling like in comparable games. You can also take cover behind certain obstacles or choose to blow them up.

The game extends over four levels (the four Nu-Worlds).</desc>

Are you a bad enough dude to rescue Ronnie?" After hearing that, the Bad Dudes pursue the DragonNinja through the New York City streets, a moving big rig truck, a large storm sewer, a forest, a freight train on an old Southern Pacific line, a cave and into an underground factory in order to save President Ronnie.</desc>

		<name>Bad Dudes</name>
		<desc>The gameplay of Bad Dudes is roughly similar to the 1985 Konami side-scrolling arcade game Rush'n Attack and the 1984 side-scrolling beat-'em-up Kung Fu Master, but allows up to two players to play at once. Player One controls the character named "Blade" wearing white pants and Player Two controls the character named "Striker" wearing green pants. Players start with the ability to do basic punches, kicks and jumps. Some moves are special like spinning kicks and the ability to charge themselves up with "inner energy" (Qi) by holding the punch button to throw a powerful long-range attack that hits all opponents in front of the player. Players will also come across several power-ups; some are weapons like knives and nunchakus and some recharge a player's health, and yet others add a few seconds to the remaining time.[7]



The various types of enemies encountered in the game have their own means of attack. The basic blue-colored ninja directly charge the player, while some leap with their swords, or throw shuriken and makibishi; there are also acrobatic kunoichi female ninja, attack dogs, and even people who are on fire. The enemies may be beaten down or avoided. Most enemies can be beaten with only a single hit of any kind, and multiple enemies can be defeated with one hit if they are standing close together.



At the end of each level, one of the "super warrior" bosses will appear which needs to be defeated to progress to the next level. The first of them is Karnov, who cameos from the Data East game of the same name;[8] the background music during the fight with him is similar to the main theme in Karnov as well.[note 1] Each boss has their own special attacks: Karnov, for example, can breathe fire at the player. At the successful completion of each level, the dude(s) strike a "bad" pose and proclaim, "I'm bad!". The shout, and the game's American wordmark logo are both similar to the Michael Jackson song "Bad" released the previous year. In the Japanese version of the game, this quote was originally a battle cry.</desc>

		<name>Badlands Pete</name>
		<desc>The gouvernor's daughters were kidnapped and he hires the desperado Badlands Pete to get them back. The player takes the role of Pete, walks through the side-scrolling levels and shoots everything that moves. This is to be taken literally because the enemies are not restricted to the usual bandits; there are also other people like old ladies which try to land a hit. To be fair, these are mostly encountered when Pete uncalled enters their houses by using the so-called "Strip-A-Motion" feature. This basically means that Pete can walk "inside" the screen to enter houses or walk behind obstacles.

To shoot the enemies, Pete needs to draw his gun, aim and shoot - for the player these are three different actions. He can't walk when the gun is drawn so it needs to be holstered, too. The amount of bullets (replenishment can be found in houses or at dead enemies) and health is limited. The latter is represented by a heart full of red liquid which drains when Pete is hit by bullets or touches enemies.</desc>

The races consist of 3 souped-up cars toughing it out over 4 laps on one of the 8 tracks, which are viewed from above. Two human players can take part, but only the winner continues without using up credits, so you will only see the early races in two-player mode. 

You are armed with guns, which can be used to slow opposing cars. During the races spanners can be collected, which are then cashed in for upgraded turbos, improved weaponry and engine upgrades. Hazards on the later tracks include ramps, bridges, buildings collapsing onto the track and barriers which open and close in a random sequence.</desc>

Now, in response to popular demand, master game designer Chris Crawford gives us Balance of Power: The 1990 Edition - a new and enhanced game of global politics and power struggles. Featuring a new multi-polar level, this game allows 80 countries to ship weapons and troops and fight wars. Your challenge as a superpower is to monitor their policies and use your influence - at times to the point of diplomatic crisis - to protect your interests.</desc>

		<name>Balance of Power : Geopolitics in the Nuclear Age</name>
		<desc>Balance of Power is a computer strategy game of geopolitics during the Cold War, created by Chris Crawford and published in 1985. The game is notable for engaging the player in brinkmanship.

The goal of the game is simple: the player may choose to be either the President of the United States or the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and must lead the chosen superpower for eight years, seeking to maximize "prestige" and avoiding a nuclear war. Each turn is one year long; at the beginning of each year, the player is presented with a set of incidents and crises in various countries around the globe, and must choose a response to each one. Responses may range from no action, to diplomatic notes to the other superpower, to military maneuvers. Each response is then met with a counter-response, which may vary from backing down to escalation. The player then gets a chance to initiate actions, and deal with the opponent's responses.

This core mechanic is similar to that of Bruce Ketchledge's 1983 game Geopolitique 1990, published by SSI. One difference from the earlier game is how negotiations are resolved. In both games, backing down in a negotiation results in a loss of prestige, which will reverberate politically. Likewise, in both games brinkmanship may result in a global war. In Geopolitique, such wars were actually fought in-game, after which the game continued. In Balance of Power, such a war ends the game instantly, with the following message: "You have ignited a nuclear war. And no, there is no animated display of a mushroom cloud with parts of bodies flying through the air. We do not reward failure."</desc>

		<desc>This puzzle game features four players, any number of which can be human or computer, and is viewed from an isometric perspective. The basic gameplay is very similar to Virgin's Spot license. Your aim is to take control of the largest area of the board, which is done by moving your pieces so as for them to be next to pieces of another colour, which will then become your colour. There are three types of move Ã¢â‚¬â€œ short moves which also see you retain the square you were in, jumps in which you lose the previous square, and moves using the teleporting device to move a larger distance. There are over 100 levels, which needn't be played in sequence. The board layouts feature gaps in, which must be incorporated into your strategy, to ensure that you don't leave a space next to a large number of your pieces, which would allow an opponent to swallow them up.</desc>

Developed by Pandamonium Entertainment and published by the legendary Psygnosis (Shadow of the Beast, Ork, Agony), the game continues the tale of Hegor the Barbarian.

After being improperly defeated some years ago, evil lord Necron has been reincarnated by one of his cult followers. Now only Hegor is strong, courageous, and stupid enough to face Necron and his minions.

Unlike the original Barbarian, which was an action game with a bizarre point’n’click control interface, Barbarian II plays just like a typical action/adventure title with a maze-like layout. During his adventures, Hegor will visit many interesting locales like a forest full of thugs, werewolves and spiky pits, a long, long cave, a semi-friendly human city, a dungeon, and finally Necron’s temple. All areas are huge, confusing, and full of enemies and traps.</desc>

From the lands to the north, a hero is sent to help the city and free the princess. He is Gorth, the strongest of the barbarian warriors. With his sword in hand, he has to beat eight of Drax's best warriors and at last the magician himself. He will fight them in the woods, on the mountaintop, in the dungeon... finally reaching Drax's palace itself.

This is essentially a one- or two-player fighting game where you control a big barbarian and fight another player or a computer AI. There are several kinds of hits, and some hits take off half a point while others take off a whole point. Each player has six of these "power points". They also have a special hard to perform "death sword" which decapitates your opponent, killing him with one fell swoop.</desc>

Mangar cast the spell of Eternal Winter on the surroundings, isolating Skara Brae from any possible help. Guards that were entrusted with the task of protecting the town have disappeared within one night. Only a party of brave adventurers can save Skara Brae and defeat Mangar. 

The Bard's Tale is a fantasy role-playing game similar to Wizardry games, with first-person exploration of pseudo-3D maze-like environments, and turn-based combat against randomly appearing enemies. Unlike early Wizardry installments, the town can be explored physically, and parts of the overworld are accessible as well. Several dungeons must be explored before the player can tackle the final quest.

Six character classes are available when the player is prompted to create a party of six adventurers in the beginning of the game: Bard, Hunter, Monk, Paladin, Rogue, Warrior, Magician, and Conjurer. The last two can be promoted when specific conditions are met during gameplay. The bard class plays a special role, possessing magical songs that improves the party's performance in combat and are required to solve some of the game's puzzles.</desc>

		<desc>Bargon Attack is one of the less known adventures from Coktel Vision, though it was one of the first that introduced the unique interface that was used in many Coktel games that followed.  It was also one of the first of Coktel's games to use FMV technology in cut-scenes.

The gameplay is a mix of science fiction, cyberpunk and comedy elements. It takes place in the near future when an alien race named Bargon conquered the Earth and enslaved its people. You take a role of the young programmer who decides to put an end to the cruel aliens. You'll travel through 20 or so locations. Each one consists of 1 to 3 screens, similar to other Coktel games.

Along your travels, you'll face dangerous creatures and some strange alien technology. There are some occasions when you can die (though the option to replay the level is always available), plus the game also features several arcade sequences.</desc>

On each of the five levels, Bart must collect (or get rid of) the ingredients that the Space Mutants are planning to use to build their machine, such as purple objects or balloons. He also has to collect enough "proof" of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are "using" human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.</desc>

In a 2D platform gaming style, players run up to the top of towers, trying to combine 3 letter pickups to collect plain daft bonuses (there were something like 500 different 3 letter combinations) and then jump off the building and base jump down the outside. The last player to avoid the sticky out bits of the building and successfully open their parachute before becoming pavement art wins the round.</desc>

To defeat the Penguin, Batman must make his way through a number of levels, usually beating up henchmen from the Red Triangle Circus Gang with punches and kicks. There are also some special weapons, which must be collected and have limited ammunition: these include Batarangs, throwing disks or a Batrope. Some special enemies can only be defeated by applying the correct weapon.

Some levels give more weight to platforming than fighting, such as a rooftop chase with Catwoman or navigating the sewers while searching for the Penguin's lair.</desc>

		<desc>Batman also known as Batman: The Movie is an action video game developed by Ocean Software based on the 1989 film of the same name. It was released in 1989 for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Atari ST, Commodore 64, MS-DOS, ZX Spectrum.

The game consists of five stages based on events from the movie. Each stage has a time limit and a health gauge (represented by Batman's face turning into the Joker's), with Batman losing a life if he runs out of either. The first stage sees players controlling Batman as he navigates the Axis Chemical Plant to confront Jack Napier, leading to the incident in which he becomes The Joker. In this level, the game features side-scrolling gameplay, in which Batman can use his Batarangs to defeat enemies or and his grapple gun to reach higher platforms and swing across gaps. In the second level, Batman rides in his Batmobile where he must dodge traffic and use a grapple to swing around corners to avoid running into the police. The third level is a puzzle section in which Batman must identify various components for Smilex, the deadly chemical Joker has put into the market. The fourth level takes place during Joker's parade, in which Batman must use the Batwing to cut away balloons filled with poisonous gas without hitting the balloons themselves. Finally, the fifth level, which reprises the gameplay of the first level, sees Batman make his way to the top of Gotham Cathedral to finally confront Joker.</desc>

Using a Chinese variation of the game of Chess, pieces like the Queen and Bishop are replaced by Counsellors, Ministers, and Cannon. Pieces behave differently than their European counterparts and even the board is set up differently. Two things remain the same: the ultimate goal of checkmating the opposing player's king and the Battlechess style animated battles that occur when two pieces contend for the same spot on the board.</desc>

There is a different animation for each permutation, depending on which pieces are capturing or being captured. You can also play in 2D without animation. 

The game's opening library includes 30,000 different moves, ensuring a variety of games will unfold across the 10 skill levels.

		<desc>An early squad based combat strategy game set in a medieval style fantasy world.

The player decides which race they want to play (Human, Orc, Dwarf or Elf) each with their own strengths and weaknesses. It is then a matter of clearing out areas of opponents and finding items to enhance your character's and companions abilities. 

There are many traps to avoid and death is a constant in what most people would find a very tough game. 

The nearest game to compare it to would be Rage Of Mages, though that has more of an RPG/RTT (real-time tactics) focus as opposed to "squad action", but it does bear aesthetic similarities and a squad based fantasy fighting theme.

Gameplay for leader is action-oriented, with a menu that allows to Parley/Travel/Rally Troops, change formations or use items. The leader attacks with Melee and Projectile buttons. Some classes are more reliant on teammates than others. "Parley" allows you to buy (but not sell) items, or buy a Safe Pass (skip the area)</desc>

Elite go beyond this by changing the shapes of the ships to be more Tetris style, and allowing these to be placed at each of the 4 main angles. A ‘Salvo Fire’ mode sees each player fire a succession of shots (each of your six ships gets four shots a turn until it’s sunk), meaning that strategic play involves firing on a wide range initially in the hope of finding a ship, before homing in on the area in the next turn. Finally, there’s an animated sequence for each go, which is depicted as an air strike. As well as standard two-player games, there’s also a multi-player mode in which the winner’s score accumulates until he loses, allowing for a “winner stays on” structure if there are 3 or more of you.</desc>

		<desc>A top-down space shooter that was different from most others at the time in that it did not just scroll continuously in one direction, but could scroll at different speeds in all possible directions on the X and Y axis, on the player's whim.

The game takes place above the surface of a ruined, devastated planet: each level starts within a large area, in which your ship has free movement. Avoiding surface hazards, such as auto-aiming turrets, the goal is to destroy enemy spacecraft that hover around the large area in groups. Each wave of attacks is followed by a bomb-dropping mothership, which you must hurry up and destroy before it moves off the playfield, in order to proceed to the next wave; the last mothership gives way to the boss - a gigantic spacecraft that will chase you around the playfield. Beaten it? you are transported to a short section of standard shooter fare, where the screen auto-scrolls vertically, at the end of which you face a final monstrosity. This ends the level - on to the next one.

Absorbing enemy fire will deplete your power, while collecting power-ups and destroying turrets can bring it back up somewhat. At 0% power, the game is over - although you may get an option to continue, based on how far you got.</desc>

		<name>BattleTech : The Crescent Hawk's Inception</name>
		<desc>BattleTech: The Crescent Hawk's Inception is a turn-based adventure/role-playing video game released in 1988 by Westwood Associates and based on the BattleTech franchise.

In the 3lst century five states are continually fighting for supremacy. As 18-year-old Jason Youngblood, you're still at school but instead of learning quadratic equation you're being trained how to be a Mech warrior, defending the Lyran Commonwealth. Mechs are massive military robots, armed to the teeth with lasers and machine guns, and piloted by humans

Hours of play need to be put in to get anywhere in Battletech, but the experience is so uneventful, only a dedicated reviewer or RPG fan could be bothered to persevere. The only pleasure lies in building up Jason's skills and later recruiting friends. Instead of being explosive, combat is dull, merely consisting of two or more Mechs firing laser after laser at each other. The shots don't even appear on the main screen. Instead, a small window displays messages and sometimes shows an animated Mech firing a laser. This is both confusing and distinctly unexciting.</desc>

So grab your blaster, hop on the Toadster and go get 'em!

You will control a battletoad through various levels. Some are side-scrolling beat-em-ups, other are vertical drops down a shaft, fighting as you go, others have you riding a rocket or surfboard, shooting or avoiding enemies. At the end of each area, there is a boss. In some areas, about half-way through, you may have a mini-boss.</desc>

These are located at opposite ends of the playing area, so you can pursue them in either order. Needless to say, the terrorists have plenty of forces out to prevent you getting too far.

Unusually, the game features both a helicopter and a tank - you choose either from the base, and can fly/drive back there to change. The best strategy is to use the helicopter to shoot out air-based enemies and repair the various bridges, then return for the tank. You get 4000 seconds in which to complete all this, and losing a life costs you 500 of these.</desc>

(Bureau of Astral Troubleshooters), an ultra-secret organization serving the Confederation of the Galaxies in the 22nd century, you will be assigned various missions covering a wide range of spy activities and planets. 

B.A.T. is a mixture of first-person adventure game and role-playing. Most of the game is spent exploring the futuristic locations, talking to characters and gathering items needed to advance the narrative. Combat occurs randomly and utilizes a real-time system: the player must prepare for the battle within a limited amount of time, after which the combatants exchange blows. The protagonist is able to side-step and dodge the attacks. Other features include the ability to program the B.O.B. (organic computer implanted on your arm), and RPG-style character development based on various stats.</desc>

		<name>B.C. Kid</name>
		<desc>B.C. Kid, or Bonk's Adventure is a 2D platform video game developed by Red Company and Atlus that was released in 1989-1990 for the TurboGrafx-16. In Japan it was released as PC Genjin (PC原人?) in 1989, a play on the Japanese name for the system, 'PC Engine'. The game was re-released for the TurboGrafx-16 in the U.S. in 1992 on the Gate of Thunder 4-in-1 game CD-ROM. The game was later ported to the NES, Game Boy, Amiga, arcade systems under different titles (FC Genjin, GB Genjin and BC Genjin). It is also available through Nintendo's Virtual Console service, on the PlayStation Store and there is a version for mobile phones in Japan.

Bonk attacks enemies by "bonking" them with his large, invincible forehead. Bonk starts the game with three hearts' worth of health, which are depleted to blue as Bonk takes damage, and three extra lives. Bonk's health can be restored in increments by collecting fruits and vegetables.

Bonk can also collect pieces of meat as power-ups; these lend him special abilities and make him stronger. There are three stages of power-up: his normal self, a second stage during which he can stun enemies by pounding on the ground, and a third stage where he becomes temporarily invulnerable. Meat can be found in two varieties: big meat and small meat. The effects of meat are additive but wear off over time. A small meat gives Bonk the second stage of meat power and a large one takes him to stage three. Eating a small meat while in stage two will also put Bonk into the third, invincible stage of meat power. When the third stage effect wears off he returns to the second state and remains there for a while before turning back to the regular Bonk. Eating either size of meat while in the third stage of meat power-up will reset the timer on Bonk's meat power.

Bonk can occasionally collect red heart power-ups that refill an entire heart worth of health, or even more rarely, a large red heart, which restores all of Bonk's missing health. There are also two rare, blue heart power-ups in the game which will increase Bonk's maximum health by one heart.

Bonking an enemy will typically knock it backward and slightly into the air. Defeating an enemy yields points and also releases a small "smiley" power-up. Bonk's smileys are totaled at the end of each stage after defeating the boss of that stage. The player is given additional points and a caveman type congratulation based on how many smileys were collected.</desc>

The players take on the role of Johnny Justice or Sammy Stately (Paul Patriot only featured in arcade version) and must shoot their way out of the city. The arcade version had 3 mounted guns, allowing for three player simultaneous action. The home conversions support a maximum of two players.

The player must shoot everything that moves, while conserving ammo and grenades. Your machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, and you can use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets or just to clear the screen of zombie scum. Grenades you can pick up along the way include standard grenades, electro grenade and napalm bombs. Onscreen zombies explode in a splatter of blood and gore.

The screen scrolls in a variety of directions, sometimes in pseudo 3D. You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, throwing Molotov cocktails and knifes and other will simply jump right at you. You can shoot knifes out of the air if you aim well enough.

The bosses include a zombie punk who mutates into a dog, a freaky blob-snake-head that comes at the screen and a jeep which comes to life.</desc>

		<desc>Beastlord is an action game with puzzle-solving elements. The Lord of Darkness managed to trick the three guardians of the world (a unicorn, a hawk and a beam of light) into imprisonment and now overruns everything with his orc hordes. The player takes the role of a young man, who is called the Beastlord because he can interact with animals, and has to explore three levels with the goal to free the guardians. The levels are side-scrolling in nature, but there are many branches to map out.

The interaction with enemies offers no surprises: the player can perform a variety of combat moves in order to beat them up. Disposed enemies leave items behind, mostly food and money. However, the game requires the player to solve various puzzles in order to progress and to talk to the animals and humans found in the levels. Usually certain items need be found and used at the correct spot respectively traded for another item. Those non-fighting actions are initiated through a pop-up menu. The game also features basic magic, a day/night cycle (some actions are only possible at a certain time) and hunger which causes the need for constant fighting in order to keep the steadily decreasing energy bar up.</desc>

Unfortunately, the previous number one group, The Rappin' Rabbit Rockers, are very angry at the Beavers success. They put a plan into action. Jethro's wife was kidnapped and is being held hostage. She will not be released until the Beavers are disbanded and all their master tapes are destroyed. Jethro is determined not to let his Beaver comrades down. He sets off to rescue his kidnapped wife with the help of his children.

You take the role of Jethro. The aim of the game is to make your way through each level of the game, overcoming the various Rabbits allies you will encounter. For every six levels of the game that you complete, you will be given a code so that he can continue his struggle at a later date. However, the Rabbits don't take too kindly to this, so they send their biggest and most dangerous followers to attack you just prior to him being given the code. To defeat these large beasts, use your spin attack to propel the missiles back at them. Watch out, as rocks are too heavy to bat with your tail and you will use an energy point in trying.

If fighting is not enough, you must collect Charisma Stars to maintain your charisma that you will need to complete a level. 
There are also Life Stars which have the ability to give you another life, but to get these, you must sneak up on them or the will move out of your reach. To keep your helpful children from losing interest, you must find Raccoon Skin Hats to give as gifts to stay in their favor. There are switches serving different functions that need to be activated. Doors will have to be entered to locate secret rooms that may contain the stars or other valuable objects. There are Rubber Leaves that may be needed to access those hard to reach areas. Just try jumping on them. Sometimes to reach the top of a level, clouds may have to be used. Some are more solid than the others. Mushroom Seeds can be used to grow your own platform to access other platforms. You may come across machinery that activate lifts or send a jet of steam into the air. You will need a spanner to start these up. Its all up to you.</desc>

These objectives comprise little more than putting a key into a lock to unlock gates, which is done several times before you must activate a self-destruct sequence and escape within the required time, similarly to Alien Breed: Tower Assault.

As with all such games you have some enemies to foil and extra weaponry such as rockets, stun bolters and to pick up. Game mechanics are Wolfenstein 3D-influenced, and the graphics smooth and, surprisingly, fast, though they do not vary much except in colour tint. Sound effects consist of the odd gun shot and scream and the music is designed to be atmospherically suited. Four different control systems are offered.</desc>

When Robert Foster's Gap-dwelling tribe is killed by soldiers from Union City who capture him, everything changes for him. After a narrow escape from the helicopter bringing him there as it inexplicably crashes, Robert and his droid Joey must search the decaying city, attempting to befriend both the snobby rich and the frustrated poor as the two attempt to get out of the city, but in the middle of everything they uncover the dark truth about LINC, the bizarre computer which makes the city tick.

The game uses the Virtual Theatre engine from Lure of the Temptress, which allows its characters to move freely independent of the player's input, making the game world more dynamic than it is usually the case in comparable games. Otherwise, the engine provides traditional point-and-click adventure gameplay.</desc>

A large map is provided, and at any point you can pause the game and scroll around the map, which makes the forward planning easier.</desc>

		<desc>Betrayal is a Strategy game, developed and published by Rainbird, which was released in Europe in 1991.

The West Marches is ruled by a duopoly. The King and Bishop each has a court filled by courtiers presented by the knights of the land - you are one of them. Now, courtiers hold great influence as all matters of State are put to a vote in the respective Courts. If, by some chance or design, one of the knights could have more courtiers in each Court than any other then that knight would gain a majority. A chance to seize power and depose both Bishop and King would then present itself, replacing them with a suitable puppet ruler. If both Courts are so ruled then that knight is declared the winner. This is your task.

In Betrayal, four knights battle it out: managing estates, collecting taxes, creating armies, declaring war on a regular basis, spying and other noble acts. After a difficulty level has been decided upon in addition to other game options, you must travel to different villages. Villages supply taxes, wheat (the harvest of which you must personally initiate), pottery to sell and militias (for defense and for your army). A self-sufficient village is your aim, otherwise you'll have to finance it out of your own pocket. You'll also have to watch out for your popularity which, if it falls below a specified level, will result in rebellion.

At Court you must have at least 13 courtiers to overthrow the King or Bishop. To gain courtiers you must pay regular taxes, assassinate other courtiers, accuse them of treason and so on.
When traveling you will see your knight on horseback, traversing the countryside between villages. During this time he can find cash lying around on the floor and be mugged by... er, muggers. Combat is a simple arcade beat-'em-up viewed side-on.
Actually it is in the combat area that the whole game falls down. Here we have a game which promotes quite a bit of depth in its gameplay. Intrigue, assassinations, treason, economics etc, all combine to make a promising game. Then the combat comes along and spoils it. The combat is far too simplistic and lacking in any skill or judgement to be of any use to anybody. It reduces the game to a lottery. Frustrating, as combat is an important area of the game. What a shame.</desc>

		<desc>Brad Zoom takes on the Brain Eaters from the Purple Planet, in this homage to vintage action games, primarily Galaxians. There are 75 levels, accessed via passcodes.

You control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen facing upwards, firing at arrangements of aliens. You can move up and down as well as left and right as you shoot them. At set intervals an alien will emerge from the main pack and sweep down towards you.

Other levels feature Asteroids which split when shot, or a single Ã¢â‚¬ËœbossÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ alien. Aliens with green eyeballs release power-ups, such as improved weapons, shields and bombs. You have a single life with which to survive the carnage. You get points for surviving as well as scoring, so slow but cautious play is more rewarding.</desc>

		<name>Beverly Hills Cop</name>
		<desc>Eddie Murphy became a star in the police film Beverly Hills Cop, and it was this license that Tynesoft used to create a game featuring four distinct sub-games, each of which can be practiced from the main screen in some versions. First Axel Foley visits a warehouse to shoot out some bad guys in a Green Beret-influenced sequence.

The second level (first on the C64 version) involves driving after 3 lorries full of weapons, and shooting them out one by one, Chase HQ-style. Avoid contact and stay on the road to complete this. Next you must cross the grounds of a mansion, shooting anyone who gets in your way.

The final section is set within the mansion, and is first-person 3D, although with few movement angles and only one enemy on screen at a time.</desc>

		<name>Beyond Dark Castle</name>
		<desc>This sequel to Dark Castle has our formerly nameless hero now known as Prince Duncan continuing his adventures after he toppled the Black Knight's throne and was dropped by a gargoyle in Trouble 3. With Merlin's help, Prince Duncan finds his way behind the Black Knight's throne where there is a fireplace and mantle. At the start of each new game, Duncan tries to take a torch on the wall beside the fireplace, and the entire wall spins around to reveal a large Ante Room containing 5 pedestals for holding orbs. Your mission is to collect all 5 orbs to open a gate to lead you to a final duel with The Black Knight.  

This game has similar gameplay and 15 new levels - five of which scroll as opposed to the static screens of the past.  These 5 are: Swamp, Black Forest, East Labyrinth, West Labyrinth, and Black Knight's Showdown &amp; The Final Battle.  There are different enemies and items such as multiple keys and a helicopter pack which lets you fly in the Swamp and Black Forest levels.  You must pick up Gas to use it also.   The game map is larger with longer levels.  Different elements present include  weapons-based fighting, mazes, bombs which are used to destroy enemies or walls, and a health system.  

Some enemies will decrease your health when hitting you instead of killing you outright. Elixirs will protect your health but it will also deplete slowly over time and can be restored by picking up food or leaving the level. There is now the option to save your game but it must be done from one of the computers in the castle's Computer Room.  There's also a new practice mode to try out levels.  When playing in Advanced mode, there's a different ending to the game than normal.</desc>

		<name>Big Business</name>
		<desc>Financial management games have been around since the dawn of home computers. It goes without saying that most of them consisted of little more than boring figures and statistics. So you can just imagine my delight when Big Business fell onto my desk.
Up to three human or computer players can participate in the fun and each one begins the game with equal assets. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s then down to the individual to ensure that the company makes its fortune by the investment of money in research, development, production, advertising and most importantly, champagne!

Humourous screens are used to display and control the action, you can control the game using either the mouse, joystick or your keyboard.

Initially, Big Business is quite good fun and it really comes into its own in the multi-player mode. However, this is probably due to the humourous graphics, because after a while boredom sets in due to the repetitive nature of the gameplay. The high price is another stumbling block and it would have been better suited to the budget market.</desc>

		<desc>Long, long time ago (but not necessarily in a galaxy far, far away), there was a caveman named Big Nose. One day he went out of his cave and saw a pterodactyl flying around. "That will be my dinner", - thought Big Nose, took out his trusty club and ran after the winged reptile. Naturally, his quest for nutrition became much longer and more dangerous than he had ever imagined...

In this platform action game, you guide Big Nose through prehistoric levels, fighting prehistoric animals of various kinds. Big Nose starts out with his club, but will gain other, more powerful weapons. During your quest you can collect bones, which are the currency of the game. There are shops in which you can buy weapons and various spells that you'll be able to cast.</desc>

		<name>Bill's Tomato Game</name>
		<desc>Bill's Tomato Game is a puzzle game similar to the ones in the Incredible Machine series. Completely mouse-controlled, the game is divided in a series of non-scrolling screens, each one being a puzzle. The main objective is to move an anthropomorphic tomato from the left side of the screen to a conveyor belt on the right side. Several objects hinder progress by squishing, perforating, exploding and destroying the tomatoes. The player has an infinite number of them, but a time constraint is in place: a timer runs in the bottom left of the screen. The tomato movement can be started and stopped by clicking a semaphore on the bottom of the screen (the screen objects move independently, with their own timing). In order to solve the levels, you pick various gadgets at the bottom of the screen and place them according to your strategy. These gadgets are:

? An electric fan that can boost and alter your tomato's trajectory;

? A trampoline where the tomato can bounce and reach new heights;

? A Jack-In-The-Box to eject the tomato upwards;

? A blocking box to stop the tomato's movement.</desc>

		<name>Biplane Duel</name>
		<desc>Based on the Mattel Intellivision game BIPLANES from the TRIPLE ACTION compilation. Requires 2 players. The Amiga sequel SALMON-PINK MAX added a computer opponent.

An Amiga indie classic. This game came in two version - Biplane Duel (AKA Bip) was the initial 2-player only version, and later Salmon-Pink Max (AKA Biplanes) which added AI players.

Not being an Amiga owner myself I missed out on this game, but it appears to be well remembered in the Amiga community due to appearances on various magazine cover disks.

This game is a nicely presented spin on the classic Biplane style game - two planes, a hut in the middle you must avoid on take off, some clouds to hide in and a balloon to avoid / shoot. After a quick play of the 2 player version all I can say is - this AI is very very hard to beat!</desc>

		<name>Black Cauldron, The</name>
		<desc>Based on the Disney movie of the same name, The Black Cauldron focuses on the story of Taran, who is an assistant Pig-keeper in the land of Caer Dalben. One day Taran notices that one of his pigs, Hen Wen has magical powers. The Evil Horned King wants the pig so that he can locate the Black Cauldron and ultimately rule the world. Taran must now embark on a mission to rescue Hen Wen and defeat the Evil Horned King before his can discover the Cauldron's location.

The Black Cauldron is a side-view adventure game. Gameplay is similar to other Sierra adventure games of its day (such as Space Quest II or King's Quest III) but does not use a text parser. Instead the function keys are used to initiate actions. Players control Taran and can make him walk, run, swim and interact (talk) with other characters in the game. Puzzle-solving and advancement in the plot requires item manipulation of using the right item at the right time or at the right location.</desc>

This time you're flying a chunky black bomber thing, and the major difference between this and every other vertically-scrolling shoot-'em-up is that your plane carries bombs instead of guns. You can buy all the usual power-ups from shops scattered around the landscape, but you have to choose quickly as you can still be shot and damaged while your plane sits on the runway conveniently placed outside the shop. Which is a bloody stupid idea if you ask me.

Graphically the game is very pretty, but soundwise it's a complete nightmare, with a choice given at the start between grating sound effects reminiscent of a Spectrum game loading, unlistenably awful music, or blissful complete silence. As for gameplay, well, no there isn't any.

Black Hornet was obviously written by someone with no grasp of the mechanics of what makes a good shoot-'em-up, and the endlessly repetitive nature of the enemy landscape and attacks will very probably send you to sleep before you get anywhere near the end of the first level. If you do manage that, you'll find yourself in a second level which is almost identical to the first one only green.</desc>

		<desc>Black Lamp is a platform game in which you have to find and collect several colored lamps and bring them back, one by one, to a case located in the first room. There are also several types of bonuses to collect along the way, and many enemies and creatures (some flying) to fight off. The ultimate goal is to bring all the colored lamps back to the case, including the elusive Black Lamp.

The Black Lamp world is presented as a collection of rooms, all connected with ladders and/or doors, as well as outside areas where you must defend yourself by shooting or avoiding the attacking creatures.</desc>

		<name>Black Viper</name>
		<desc>Black Viper takes inspiration from games such as Fire and Forget and Chase H.Q., replacing the fast car with an armed motorcycle. As usual, this game takes place after a terrible nuclear war, with you playing as the son of a lost freedom fighter. 

The freedom fighters try to recapture the remaining cities from the mercenaries acting on behalf of the underground people who instigated the war in the first place. To do this, you must travel from city to city on the open roads, arriving within a given time frame. This is difficult due to the crowded roads, but luckily you can blow up most other vehicles with your gun. As the game progresses, enemy vehicles become harder, requiring more shots to be taken out. Luckily, your bike may be upgraded in the shop between levels.

Black Viper has a certain arcade-ish look to its graphics, a jukebox for choosing soundtracks, and comes in both OCS and AGA versions.</desc>

		<name>Blade Warrior</name>
		<desc>The world has been enslaved by Murk, and you've got to free it by collecting the seven fragments of a tablet which are in the possession of seven wizards who inhabit seven towers.

Blade Warrior is a unique game in two ways, the most obvious being the graphics. Everything in this game is seen in silhouette - as you wander around looking for magical items and killing baddies, all you see is your silhouette and the silhouette of everything around you. The background is made up of a night sky, with clouds and hills.

Secondly, the game is an unusual mix of adventuring and battling. On your way to collecting magical items and exploring the huge ingame map, you're assaulted by baddies. Then, once you have collected certain artifacts, you can conjure up spells (so long as you have the recipe) back in your tower, trade with wizards for those all important tablet pieces and get clues to the next important artifacts.</desc>

		<desc>A good, if challenging, conversion of the Arcadia game. The graphics are of a high standard - everything is suitably metallic and hi-tech but the front-end presentation is weak with no theme tune or loading screen. Craft control takes a little getting used to due to the high level of Inertia - it's much more apparent on this version than on the others - but practice makes perfect.

Blastaball should keep most Amiga owners happy for a while, though interest could soon be lost due to its simplistic concept; the game doesn't change much, it just gets harder.</desc>

That means to say that the main gameplay consists of flying through single-screen wrap-around levels shooting at rocks, which split into smaller rocks when hit, eventually becoming small enough to disappear. 

In this case the Asteroids are protecting Mukor, an evil being who is poisoning planets under the Colonising Corp’s control.
Each level is split into either 9 or 16 sub-levels, which are chosen through a square in which any remaining level which is adjacent to the last level completed can be selected. There are 3 different ships (Speeder, Fighter and Warrior), which can be switched between at any time. Power-ups (including improved weapons, shield recharges and a faster thrust) can be collected by flying into them.</desc>

Gameplay follows the usual pattern for Ikari Warriors-style games - kill off the bazooka-toting baddies, which emerge from hiding places or enter the screen in waves. You can do this by either shooting them or running them over with your tank. Parts of the scenery often block your path and need destroying. Once you clear the level you are confronted by a boss, which in the first level is an enormous tank which you have to disable the guns of.</desc>

The levels themselves scroll sideways and are layered with platforms. Making the task difficult are spiders, mice and the like - watch out in particular for the jumping frogs. Once the appropriate spells have been cast (involving lots of back-tracking to collect objects and bring them to the cauldron) the objects to make an underwater diving suit must be obtained.</desc>

		<name>Blobz</name>
		<desc>Not the most inspiring name for a game, but then look at Worms and how successful that title was. Blobz steals its gameplay style directly from Lemmings, replacing the suicidal rodents with green nondescript things decked out with tiny eyes.

While Lemmings' motivation for suicide is biological, blobs just don't know any better. If they walk into spikes or water they die, but there's no stopping them. A walking they will go, straight into trouble. The puzzles themselves are satisfying, if frustrating and they have been well thought out using the various 'skills' which you can assign each Blob. Smooth horizontal scrolling and the neat moving water effects and special touches are very nice. While the platforms themselves might look basic, there is a good reason for this: a level designer has been included so you can make as many as you like, and it's simple to use. The game is based on six worlds each mapped out like a maze and there are 60 levels in total.

The amount of levels and the increasing difficulty means that this is not a fast game to finish. Add the possibility of infinite custom levels and you have a lot of game. A well recommended download.</desc>

A number of blocks are suspended in space, and you bounce around these trying to reach the exit, having first completed the level's objectives. These include painting certain blocks à la Q*Bert, collecting objects and rescuing other blobs by guiding them to the exit. 

Additional types of block includes ones which shoot at you, cracked tiles which don't last long, sticky tiles you can't get much leverage from, and switches to make other blocks become visible or accessible. The 3D is an integral aspect of the game, with falling off ledges into oblivion causing the loss of a life.</desc>

The player has 4 missions to take on, in each case trying to kill baddies for the money they have, which can be spent in the shop rooms to upgrade their craft. Energy is depleted by contact with enemies and the walls, although there are some baddies who simply hover on your ship and steal, rather than physically doing damage.

The game is a shoot 'em up which scrolls both horizontally and vertically, while being viewed from an R-Type style sideways perspective. Navigating the levels sometimes requires the player to duck through gaps in scenery.</desc>

You play as Ransom Stark, a computer hacker, scrounger or mercenary (depending on how the player answers the opening questions when they start a new game) who finds himself caught up in a sinister affair involving an evil global megacorporation, TransTechnicals, Manhattan, a fight for Cyberspace and vampires!

Ransom Stark became stricken with Hopkins-Brie Ontology Syndrome whilst working at TransTechnicals, due to his forced extended exposure to Cyberspace while he worked there. As soon as he was diagnosed he was dismissed from TransTech and found himself homeless and hopeless. Thankfully an ingenious woman, with a personal vendetta against TransTech, named Deirdre Tackett saved his life by inserting a prototype brain implant of her own design and this restoring his grip on reality.

Over the following year Ransom became known as a reliable freelance until one day he got a job worth much more than he bargained for! His employers turned out to be vampires and as part of his 'payment', Ransom was turned into a follower of the evil head-vampire, Abraham Van Helsing -- except his brain implant kicked in allowing him to keep temporary control of his humanity.

Now Ransom must put a stop to Van Helsing's plans to take over Manhattan and control Cyberspace and hopefully save himself from being a vampire before its too late!</desc>

However, the second-in-command of Bloodwych, named Zendick, turned against his group, banished his opponents to the astral plane, and began working on a mad plan - summon the ultimate evil, the Lord of Entropy. The player controls the champion of Trazere, whose ultimate goal is to stop Zendick and restore peace in the country.

Bloodwych is an RPG in the style of Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder, being a 3D first-person maze-like game. This game's distinguishing feature is the two-player split screen support, allowing simultaneous playing on one computer.

Each player controls a party of four characters. The four basic classes are warrior, mage, adventurer, and thief; however, each class also has sub-classes, which are represented by four different colors. These colors come into play also when the characters learn and combine spells.</desc>

If the player wins, more of the exposed picture of the opponent is displayed. There are ten stages to complete.

In the game there is an 8x8 board. Each space in the board contains a point value. The object of the game is to earn as many points as possible by moving a marker to a non empty space to collect how ever many points are in that space. The first player is only able to move the marker horizontally, and the second player can only move the marker vertically. The board contains both negative and positive point values, so ideally you want to take a high, positive point value and force your opponent to take a negative value. The game ends when no more moves are possible, and the player with the most points wins.</desc>

Each level is a variation on the jumping theme, with the characters finding a necessary attribute (e.g. a guitar) somewhere in the level. The sixth and final level ends on-stage.</desc>

		<desc>This is an overhead-viewed racing game similar in style to Super Sprint. There are 7 courses of increasing difficulty, incorporating ramps and bumps which significantly affect the bike's handling. Each course has a time limit you must complete 3 laps of the course within, or it's game over. The further inside the time limit you are, the more points you score.

There's a computer opponent, but the scoring isn't affected by whether you beat him just so long as you qualify. There is a two-player mode. A unique feature at the time is the action replay, which can be viewed in slow motion.</desc>

		<name>Bob's Bad Day</name>
		<desc>The reason why Bob's having a bad day is that his head has become detached from his body, and they've been hurtled off into different places. To retrieve his body, he must progress through 50 levels, then a further 50 to escape before he can be put back together.

Gameplay involves the character being on a rotating landscape with a set number of coins placed all over it. By rotating the joystick, the player moves the landscape so that Bob moves over the coins and finds the exit. 

The levels include many spikes, contact with which causes the loss of coins; if the player has no coins when contact is made, it's game over. Some level designs are fiendish, with lots of corridors and alleyways, teleports, and bricks to break through (by building up enough momentum).

There are a host of special 'power-ups' across the level as well. The simplest ones (and the first ones the player will meet) change the direction of gravity, causing the player's character to automatically 'fall' to the left when not in motion. Others include a sticky mode where Bob stops bouncing (unless the player presses the fire button), a heavier-bounce mode, and a very useful one allowing the player to 'thrust' Bob around, ideal for reaching precariously-placed coins.

Once the player reaches level 51 a further twist is added - Bob's body starts in a separate point of the level, and this must also be coaxed to the exit. The view always centers on Bob's head, even once this is in the exit, so the player will have to use the scanner alone to guide the body across - knowing that a move which benefits one can drag the other off course.</desc>

		<name>Bob's Garden</name>
		<desc>After ridding the neighbourhood of aliens from the planet Graaf Pooky, Bob was looking forward to some relaxation time. Bob was enjoying himself. He was sat in a deckchair, sipping some strawberry cordial through a straw with a knotted hankerchief on his head, protecting his small bald spot.

Suddenly, Bob heard a noise and saw a group of aliens from the planet Mord attacking his prized garden. They were attempting to steal all of his fruit! Back on their home planet, the aliens are running out of food, so they are attempting to borrow a cup of cherries off Bob, unfortunately they forgot to ask Bob first! This was too much for Bob, so he ran immediately to action, forgetting his flamethrower, Bazooka and even his bicycle pump. All he had was a machine for producing special balls, which he had invented yesterday. The balls are special, as they never lose momentum. You drop it from a high height, and it will bounce back to that same height, overcoming air friction in the process. The only problem was that the more the ball bounces, the colder it gets, and contact with a warm surface causes the ball to violently explode. Bob isn't worried, as he was wearing Asbestos gloves while sunbathing (His hands are very sensitive to sunlight).</desc>

Five other planets are involved, each submitting 2 brav fighters - the advanced Titanica, the divided Eclipse, the prehistoric Gellorn-5, the morphed Misma, and the matriachal Feminion.

Combat works in a similar way to the original, with moves designed around a one-button controller, with special moves activated either by a particular joystick movement while jumping, or by holding the fire button to charge the move up. The one-player game sees you progress through fighting the other characters in turn. Multiplayer options include character V character and a 4/8-player tournament.</desc>

It was followed by Body Blows Galactic and Ultimate Body Blows. A version for DOS was also released. The game has a lot of similarities to Street Fighter II, for example, both had two characters with projectile, rising uppercut and spinning kick special moves and played identically (as with Ryu and Ken).

		<desc>Bomber Bob is a vertically scrolling shooter by Italian studio Idea. The player controls a dog flying a World War 1 plane, able to shoot both other aircrafts in the air (controlled by humorous caricatures of dogs, pigs wearing WW1 helmets and other animals) and bomb targets on the ground for coins, via a fixed crosshairs like in Xevious or Twinbee. These coins can be spent in between levels to purchase weapon upgrade and extra lives from a vending machine. Also in between levels the game offers a few false-3D flying stages where we see the plane from behind and have to fly through a tunnel while trying to avoid the walls. There also are a few end level bosses, mostly farm animals. The game is imbued with humor: destroyed enemies plummet to the ground like Wile E. Coyote from the Road Runner cartoons, accompanied by funny voices and sound effects, matching the cartoony feel of the game.</desc>

You play the hero selected for this dangerous mission in this single screen platform game spread over various levels. On each level is a various amount of bombs and when one is nine seconds from exploding then you have to reach it and touch it to reset it before it explodes. If it explodes it will increase a radiation meter on the left of the screen and when it is full you lose one of three lives.

As you defuse the bombs, fuel capsules are sprayed out by a pipe and a certain number also need collecting and put in a box and you can carry as many capsules as you want. To reach higher platforms you can either use pipes that make you bounce higher or you can fall of the bottom of the screen to appear at the top. Moving about the screen is a ball and if you touch it carrying capsules then you lose them and you also increase the radiation meter. Once you have collected enough capsules and defused a certain amount of bombs then you move to the next level.</desc>

Bigger ones have such a huge blast radius that Bombuzal cannot trigger them directly - instead, he has to explode smaller bombs first and cause a chain reaction. So as one might imagine, later levels turn into loud blastfests that need to be carefully planned.

Besides, later levels introduce all kinds of additional hazards and gimmicks, like ice floors, movable bombs, disappearing ground tiles, and much more. Nobody said being a pyromaniac is easy.</desc>

		<desc>Hypothesizing what sorts of adventures might be got up to in Bomberman's pants, this game provides some similar gameplay in a cartoony "adult" style -- mobile phalluses hobble around on their stubbly little testicles, collecting sex-themed bonuses (condoms for protection against STDs, jockey shorts to boost speed) and avoiding environmental hazards (viruses, AIDS, and the dreaded snapping-teeth-of-inexpertly-performed-fellation).

The player's "shot" can be used to temporarily neutralise enemies, open gaps in walls (revealing in the background a picture of a naked lady), or stun competitors in the multiplayer (up to 4 players) game.  Once enough bonuses have been collected, doff a condom and hop into the sack with the blonde in the middle of the screen.  Level layouts vary, but basic gameplay (and even the cheesecake in the background) remains much the same through 50 levels.

The multiplayer game features an additional surreal mini-game, where the alpha phalli prowl the screen's periphery around a model who seems to love nothing more than to have select garments of her clothing pawed by stretching penises with grasping hands inexplicably appearing at their ends -- you've never seen anything quite like it.</desc>

This figure asks them to collect certain items that he has placed inside various buildings to test his security force. If they return the items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be rewarded. The two of them state that they will get the job done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that each building is packed with security guards who will raise the alarm if they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended.

As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without  one of the three spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.</desc>

		<desc>Boppin' is a puzzle-oriented video game created by Jennifer Diane Reitz in 1991, developed under the company name Accursed Toys and published by KarmaSoft for the Amiga computer with only 32 colors on screen. Around that time KarmaSoft held a level design contest. The game sold poorly with 284 copies, so Jennifer got it republished by Apogee Software (now known as 3D Realms) with up to 256 colors on screen. Due to mature content containing blood and Seppuku, the game was rated for players aged 25.

The game takes place in a multiverse where fictional universes exist mostly by the minds and dreams of people. One such universe called Arcapaedia is inhabited by video game characters, especially the two stick-figured, triangle-headed Yeet and Boik. However all the arcade games have been diminished due to the lack of bad guys and villains taken away by the puristic Hunnybunz Family. Since heroes and good guys are not able to rescue the missing characters, Yeet and Boik having a neutral alignment, set off to thwart Hunnybunz, his wife and his lovechild's intentions.</desc>

As a platform and blast adventure, you must progress through all levels by collecting the various icons scattered at the most inconvenient of places. Who put the required object on a platform that demands a super-hyper jump from a dangerously high-up ledge?

It's not all run, jump and shoot, though. Sub-levels include a puzzle game against the computer where you shuffle square blocks about a board in an attempt to recreate the original pattern. There's also a turbo bike section, featuring an Outrun/Lotus perspective. Final words: Frustratingly slow and tedious with minimal action.</desc>

		<name>Botics</name>
		<desc>Botics is a Pong variant set in the future. It is disguised as futuristic sports event in which the player fights against five opponents. The basic idea is that each playfield has a large opening on two sides which are guarded by remote-controlled robots. Each of the opponents controls a robot with the goal to reflect a bouncing ball so it enters the opposite opening. If that happens, the screen switches to the next of five areas, e.g. if the players were in the second chamber, they either switch to area one or three depending on who scored. A player needs to score a certain amount of times to win a match.

Variations to the areas (which are the same for each opponent) consist of obstacles covering the middle of the room. There is also the possibility to charge up the robot which results in a more powerful and fast returning of the ball, but when overdone it causes the robot to explode.</desc>

		<name>Brain Blasters</name>
		<desc>The wizards are revolting (and it's not just their personal habits). Whichever one passes the test of IOZU will become the grand master and dominate the rest. To pass this test the wizard has to defeat the dark side of his spirit by completing a series of memory puzzles. A pattern is displayed at the start of each level, which then has to reproduced by you. Unlike most games you don't control the pieces. Instead you operate a little wizard who has to scurry around collecting the pieces of the pattern as they fall from the heavens and then place them on board. The presentation is very slick. There's a good intro with sampled sound and a snazzy picture. The menu screen has a couple of finely animated dragons and there's an option that lets you trade gold (points) for tips which is another nice touch. 

Brain Blasters is fun to begin with, but after the fifth level, or so, the novelty value begins to pale. There's a two-player mode where a couple of wizards can battle it out for the pieces but even this becomes boring. Devotees of memory puzzles in The Express will probably like this, otherwise you'd be well-advised to try before you buy.</desc>

However, there are obstacles, including blocks (which can, similar to Soko-Ban, only pushed but not pulled), closed doors, a time limit or other blobs which should not be touched. Keys, which act like the blocks mentioned before, can be used to open the closed doors. If is possible to get a level into an unwinnable state, e.g. by pushing a key into a corner.</desc>

		<name>Bram Stoker's Dracula</name>
		<desc>One of several adaptations of the 1992 film version of the classic vampire tale, the Amiga version is a side-scrolling action game.

The player controls Jonathan Harker, who, on his quest to destroy the Transylvanian vampire, must make his way through nine levels, starting at a tavern near Dracula's castle and then the castle itself. Back in England, Dracula and his minions must be driven out of a convent, an abbey and the house of Jonathan's fiancée Mina, among others. A primary task in each level is to find and destroy several coffins of Transylvanian earth. Hindering Jonathan on his way are henchmen as well as critters under the vampire's control: bats, rats, snakes and more. The last coffin in each location is usually guarded by one of Dracula's stronger minions, which include his three brides, the madman Renfield, and Mina's friend Lucy, now turned undead.

To defeat the enemies, Jonathan uses punches and kicks. Lost health can be regained by finding potions; extra lives are also available. In addition, Dr. Van Helsing has left holy crosses lying about - once picked up, they enable a powerful ranged holy attack, which only lasts for a short time, however. Staircases and doors connect the different parts of the levels - to open doors, keys must first be found.</desc>

You play a character named Kyne, a man who has a price on his head. You must search the mining asteroid, Brattacus, to gather proof of a government plot against you and to try to stay alive. Surveillance cameras are watching you, so take any chance to disable them.

Brataccas is a place where greed and corruption rule the day.  The residents are treacherous, and while they can be bribed they are not above murder, so be careful out there.</desc>

You do this indirectly, by specifying which direction he goes in, in a manner vaguely similar to Lemmings. You also tell him when to use objects in a simplistic manner similar to the Dizzy games.

The game combines reactions and planning in quite an original way. The character himself isn't at all cutesy, as the title implies, and that may affect your perception of the game.</desc>

		<desc>An early squad-level tactical combat game, much like the X-Com series of games and the more contemporary Laser Squad. Breach 2 features turn-based combat from an isometric point of view set in the far future. As one of the more unique aspects the squad leaders gain experience from successful missions should they survive.

Breach 2 is set in the same sci-fi universe as Omnitrend's Universe and Rules of Engagement series and shares the same backstory with those games. Breach 2 is a part of the IGS (Interlocking Game System) and compatible with the two Rules of Engagement games. This means you can use Breach 2 to resolve the tactical combat situations, boarding an enemy ship for example, you run into in the starship command simulation, which is the heart and soul of the Rules of Engagement series.

A scenario builder is included with the game, making it possible to create your own missions and trade them.</desc>

You must carry out the task of rescuing your friend Chris the Crystal, who has been kidnapped by Geeza the Dragon. His other warped jungle animal friends, Barry the Bear and Graeme the Gorilla, prevent you from getting to him and rescuing your friend.

Your job is to run through each level, destroying enemies that get in your way by either "clawing" them or jumping on their heads. Along the way, collect as many crystals as you can so that you can use them at the shop to buy extra lives, credits, heavenly hit points, jinormous jumps, really raj roars (which also kills enemies), and splendid speed. There are many secret areas in a level, some will take you on a different route other than the one you take when you reach the level exit. However, you must complete certain levels in order to progress further in the game, but you can return to a level that you have completed. You are given enough time to complete the level. If you run out of time before you reach the exit, you will receive no bonus. Furthermore, you do not get to access one of the three bonus levels that you can choose from if you do.</desc>

		<desc>Brides of Dracula is a two-player split-screen game similar to Spy vs. Spy in gameplay. Each player (human or CPU) controls either the vampire hunter Van Helsing or Count Dracula. Van Helsing is summoned to the Bistritz village to kill Dracula and his brides. His goal is to find thirteen tools to kill Dracula, bring them back to Helsing's home and store them in the cupboard. For Dracula, the objective is to create thirteen brides by finding women, biting and leading them back to the crypt, where thirteen coffins are lined up waiting for their recipients.

Both characters can be killed by certain hazardous environments and non-player characters (NPCs). Some of these dangers may effect only one of the characters (ghouls only attack Van Helsing, while priests and villagers only harm Dracula). Each player starts with three lives. Collected objects and women are displayed at the bottom of the character window, along with the health bar. The game takes place in the church cemetery and the adjacent village.</desc>

		<path>./BubbleGun_v1.0.lha</path>
		<name>Bubble Gun</name>
		<desc>Bubble Gun is an Action game, developed and published by Weathermine, which was released in Europe in 1994.

The story behind Bubblegun is a simple one. You are a small crocodile with a gun that can fire bubbles (hence the inspired name) who is trapped in a castle and has to find their way to freedom. Quite why they are trapped in a castle, or why they are carrying a large gun, or indeed why they are trying to escape isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t made clear at any point, but then who really takes any notice of game plots these days?

What you are left wit is a very basic platform game, where you begin somewhere in the middle of a four-way scrolling maze. Dotted around the maze are a variety of objects, such as points bonuses, energy bonuses and time bonuses, but the most important things to look out for are sections of keys. You can carry three items at once, and there are three sections to each coloured key, so it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t too much trouble to build up a complete key. Once you have the key built, all you need to do is find the chest with a coloured lock that matches it. Open the lock and fruit and gems fall out. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re really lucky, a block with Ã¢â‚¬Å“ExitÃ¢â‚¬Â written on it will appear. This is the key that opens the level exit, and is the one thing you are looking for.</desc>

		<desc>Buck Rogers: Countdown to Doomsday is a role-playing game similar in gameplay, interface, and visual styles to the Dungeons &amp; Dragons games by SSI, despite the completely different setting and sci-fi scenario. The player's first task is to create a party of six characters from a choice of five classes (Rocketjock, Warrior, Medic, Rogue, and Engineer) and six races (Human, Desert Runner, Tinker, Venusian, Martian, and Mercurian). Then, these six new NEO recruits are trained, and are thrust into the battle for Earth.

There are several navigation modes in the game. The player can navigate the space ship on a top-down map of the Solar System, choosing planets to land on. Hostile ships may attack the player-controlled ship in this mode. Landing on a planet usually positions the heroes on a local overworld map. Finally, navigation in individual locations (towns and hostile areas) is done in first-person perspective, with pseudo-3D environments. Combat is turn-based and is viewed from an isometric perspective; characters are represented as icons and can be freely moved on the battle field.</desc>

		<name>Budokan - The Martial Spirit</name>
		<desc>Budokan is a martial arts game covering Karate (unarmed combat), Kendo (using a wooden sword), Nunchaku (using piercing chain weapons) and Bo (using a staff). The player has a realistic range of moves and must use them wisely, as Ki (life-force) is drained for every move made, whether successful or not, and both this and your stamina level must be kept high.



You can practice your skills alone, or spar against the instructors or your friends. Finally, when you feel you are ready, you can travel to the martial arts world championship tournament at Budokan.</desc>

		<name>Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show</name>
		<desc>Buffalo Bill presents a collection of six Wild West themed mini-games, which hang together around humour-lead presentation and backdrops.You can play as many or as few of these as you like, and can always have another go at them if you fail.

First task is to throw knives at a spinning board upon which a surely-terrified and fortunately-skinny lady is locked  - make sure to adjust for the rotation that will occur in the time your shot takes to hit. You get points for missing as many times as possible before hitting. Event 2 is based on shooting ability and is in two stages. First you must shoot the targets of criminals (but not innocents) as they emerge from the ground, next you must shoot the bottles they throw at you from over the horizon.

Event 3 is Calf Roping, in which you must position yourself so as to be able to throw your rope around the poor cow's neck. This is followed by Bronco Riding, in which you must adjust your balance to compensate for the Bronco trying to throw you off, by pushing the joystick out to balance two bars. Level 5 starts off like the Cow Roping, as you jump onto a Steer, before a joystick-waggling section starts. Last of all is a side-scrolling game in which you jump onto a stagecoach which has been invaded by Indians, and beat up the hijacker.</desc>

		<name>Bug Bash</name>
		<desc>Bug Bash is a horizontally scrolling platform game where you are a ladybug. The location is your home, a garden that overnight has become very untidy. Around you swarms of insects and bugs are flying about mindlessly with no interest in helping you clear up the mess. They have been brain-washed by the Evil Slug. Now you must arm yourself with a insecticide spray gun and begin your quest of restore the garden to it's normal order.

The gameplay is quite simple. You simple pick up the trash and throw it into the trash can. At the same time you should stay clear of the bugs or insects or you will lose energy which is equivalent to health in this game. The magic mushrooms that are in the game can be shot at to regain energy. There is also other pickups that will come in handy during the game. The game is divided into days and each days ends with a boss fight, i.e. an enormous frog.</desc>

		<desc>A computer's mazelike circuitry is infected with bugs, and you have been sent in to destroy them. You are armed with bombs, mines, blockades, and various types of hatchlings, which when released will track the bugs and hopefully stop them.

The basic gameplay is inspired by Dynablaster, but it differs because there is more than one way to kill the foes off. Depending on which way you push the joystick as you press fire, you will either release a quick-exploding bomb, a proximity mine, or a hatchling. Collecting 'EN' symbols will restore your energy, and 'IQ' symbols increase the ability of your hatchlings to track and hit your foes. Be careful when placing blocks; it is possible to shut yourself in.</desc>

		<name>Buggy Boy</name>
		<desc>Buggy Boy is a race game, but not just an ordinary race game. There are five different routes, offroad, north, east, west, south. The offroad course loops around back to the start, the others are long runs with a distinct beginning and ending. You must complete each leg before the time runs out.

Along the way you can pick up all kinds of bonuses. The colored flags are 30 points each, collect all colors in the order as indicated at the top of the screen to get 1000 bonus points. There are several gates the give you 100, 250 or 500 points, and a time gate. Drive through a time gate to collect it, you receive two seconds extra time upon completing a leg. Occasionally there will be a soccer ball on the road, hit it and it will fly away and you get 2000 points.

There are bridges and tunnels, be careful not to fall off the bridge into the water or crash into the tunnel wall. There also are obstacles like boulders, logs and fences. If you hit them it will cost you valuable seconds off your leg time. But if you hit a log or small stone just right, the buggy will ride on two wheels until you hit something again.</desc>

		<path>./Builderland_v1.0a_1923.lha</path>
		<name>BuilderLand</name>
		<desc>The story of this game is quite simple, presented during the intro as a series of short scenes without words. Melba is an easy-going guitar player who is having a picnic with his girlfriend; suddenly, an ultra-strong, evil-looking character appears and kidnaps the poor girl, sailing away on his ship. The brave Melba swims after the ship, and finds a bottle with a map inside. Knowing now the way to the evil kidnapper's lair, Melba embarks on a journey without further hesitation!

The premise, the map with the "stages", and the side-scrolling view indicate a platform-type action game; in reality, however, Builderland is a puzzle game, somewhat similar to the famous Lemmings. As in Lemmings, the player has no control over the protagonist himself (except on a few occasions, when "boss" enemies must be defeated by throwing certain objects at them). Instead, the player must manipulate the environment in order to build a path for Melba, deal with the enemies, etc. Melba is for the most part entirely helpless and simply walks forward automatically. Various items such as boxes, weapons, platforms, etc., must be collected and placed properly in order to save the hero from premature death.</desc>

		<desc>Mario Kart is taken one step further in this racer. The computer racers include Loretta L’Amour, the Buck-Toothed Beavers, and the uncompromising Colonel Carnage, each of which have individual looking cars, varied weapons, and some attempts at humour and pathos.

The courses are quite lengthy, and are laden with hazards and power-ups such as oil slicks and homing missiles. The computer cars appear to be faster when behind you than when in front – strange.

The handling is deliberately arcadey, with fast acceleration and braking as well as the chance to brake and steer at the same time. The graphics are third-person, with a split-screen option, in the grand Mario Kart / OutRun tradition.</desc>

Love can't climb all barriers, but a bunny skilled in baseball can smash through them, using his bat to hit each brick on each screen in turn. This sets the scene for a variant on Breakout.

The screens contain rows of bricks, some of them indestructible, and lots of doors to open for access to other sections, and dividing lines affecting where the ball can go. Power-ups are released at regular intervals. You need to press fire as the ball approaches to strike it and keep it in play.</desc>

Each burger consists of four parts which lie on the platforms. The player needs to walk over those parts and then they fall down one level - when they meet another of the parts, it also falls down. A burger is done when all four parts are on the lowest level. The platforms are interconnected with ladders which are also the only way to evade the enemies which walk around the levels (the player character can't jump). Touching an enemy results in death.</desc>

		<name>Burning Rubber</name>
		<desc>Despite the smutty title, the only ?big people? requirement is a driving license, as you?re racing through Europe and America in a variety of cars. Each level has a visual background reflecting part of the country.

The route is mapped out beforehand, but it needn?t be strictly adhered to, as the surrounding roads are all presented and can be used as you wish. The computer cars in the race will often deviate from the course as well, adding real navigation to the proceedings. You accrue damage from contact, which needs to be repaired after the race, so you need to keep some prize money coming in. 

The racing is illegal, so you are pursued by police as you go, similarly to Crazy Cars 3, so make sure not to get caught, and do your dangerous driving out of their sight. You?ll have to drive on the correct side of the road and negotiate pedestrians and other traffic as well</desc>

Like a Role-Playing-Game, you travel through the world and meet many computer-played characters. You want to rule the world. But there are other 3 characters with the same aim.

You spend the most game time looking at the map, which takes up several screens. The position of the 4 characters, their occupied conquests, the cities, and the health condition of your character are shown on the map. 

The different settlements you can occupy are old factories, camping-grounds or ruins of old mega-cities. The five great cities are opened for all competitors and can’t be occupied. In these cities you cannot fight against your enemies. 

Sometimes you meet a human for changing news, items or take them in your party. There are different classes of computer-characters: fighters, engineers or doctors for example. Every character of your party can carry up to 6 items (food, weapons). These items are produced by the settlements you control.</desc>

		<name>Butcher Hill</name>
		<desc>Intelligence reports suggest that POWs have been captured and are being held hostage at the guerilla outpost on Butcher Hill. The game is divided into three sections. 

In the first section, players steer their dinghy along a river while avoiding mines and other obstacles. If the dinghy comes into contact with any mine, it explodes. However, when the player has collected ammo, the mines can be destroyed. Coming into contact with rocks causes the dinghy to bounce out of the water for a short distance. When a jetty appears, pressing the fire button allows the player to land and start the next section.

The second section has the player finding their way through dense jungle whose path lead to the enemy camp at the base of Butcher Hill. Stopping you from proceeding are soldiers that have orders to shoot you on sight. Mines are also scattered around the jungle floor and must be avoided. If players were able to obtain a compass in the first section, their current direction will be displayed at the right of the control panel. Shooting all the soldiers in the jungle gives the player extra ammunition and stamina.  

In the final section, players need to destroy the enemy camp by blowing up huts with bullets or grenades. While they are doing that, they must also be on the lookout for any soldiers that tries to leave the camp to bring back more soldiers.</desc>

		<desc>Cabal is a coin-op conversion of Capcom's arcade game. The mechanics of the game are simple: shoot everything in sight!

The hero (there is a two player mode) runs back and forth along the bottom of the screen, ducking and dodging bullets and grenades from the enemy. The roll maneuver from the arcade was not implemented in the PC version. You return fire by moving a target around the screen which also moves your character, so be careful not to run into a bullet.

The enemies throughout the 5 levels, come thick and fast and there are loads of them, normal foot soldiers, tanks, helicopters and end of level bosses, like submarines and war machines.

Just about everything on the screen can be blown up or shot. There are bonus points to be picked up for destroying buildings and weapons to be picked up from the enemy, such as machine- and shot-guns.</desc>

		<name>Cabaret Asteroids</name>
		<desc>For those of you who have not had the pleasure of Asteroids here is a description: The game is displayed in high contrast black and white, that's just black and white, there are no shades of grey in this game. Your ship is a small white triangle, in the centre of a black screen. When the game starts, asteroids, large irregular rock shapes, drift gently into view from the outer edges of the screen. Your ship can rotate in either direction, and fire, so this is what you must do, in order to prevent your ship from being destroyed. As your shots hit the asteroids they break into smaller and smaller fragments, and the directions and speeds imparted to them seem to be highly convincing.

Cabaret Asteroids is a near perfect conversion of Asteroids for the Amiga. Its not in technicolor, there is no music, and the sounds are simple but effective. The playability of the original has not been surpassed though. I really can't fault the Cabaret Asteroids conversion, you can play by keyboard or joystick and it feels just like 1980, but without Sting and the guys in the background.</desc>

		<name>Caesar</name>
		<desc>The first in the strategy series set in the Roman Empire’s peak era starts off with you as ruler of a small province, although if you’re successful you will get tougher assignments.

You must build the city, placing crucial features such as housing estates, roads, policing, water supply, social events and the like. You’re not restricted to one city – you can build another area, linked by roads, once you’ve got the first one running smoothly. You have slaves at your disposal to build and maintain everything. 

All this would be easy if you had an infinite supply of money, the civilians didn’t complain about anything, there was no threat of combat, and you didn’t have to keep the people above you happy. Needless to say, all of these problems crop up.

Via the forums,  you will get public opinions, which are affected by how high taxes are, and whether people feel they’re getting value for money. If they don’t they could riot;– what will you tell the Emperor if that happens?

Barbarian threats are commonplace, so you need to maintain an army, and at times send it into battle. If you own Cohort 2, you can fight the battles using that, but otherwise you just issue the orders then learn of the result.</desc>

		<name>Campaign - Tactical &amp; Strategic War Simulation</name>
		<desc>Campaign covers some of the most important battles of the Second World War, from Sahara to the Russian campaign, and from the Battle of the Bulge to D-Day. A map editor allowing users to modify existing scenarios or to create new ones is included.

You can take involvement at many levels of a battle. You can take direct control of either driving or gunning a tank, direct groups of 16 tanks and their support units, and create a combined overall strategy factoring in supply routes. Over 150 different vehicles from both sides are featured.

It's a hard-core wargame that will like mostly to the "aficionados" of the genre. The game package includes a lot of extras: a thick "Equipment factfinder" manual (170 pages), 2 huge posters, replicas of WW2 postcards and of a newspaper.</desc>

		<desc>Cannon Fodder 2 is a military-themed action game with strategy and shoot 'em up elements. The player controls a small squad of up to four soldiers. These soldiers are armed with machine guns which kill enemy infantry with a single round. The player's troops are similarly fragile, and while they possess superior fire-power at the game's outset the enemy infantry becomes more powerful as the game progresses. As well as foot soldiers, the antagonists include vehicles and missile-armed turrets. The player must also destroy buildings which spawn enemy soldiers. For these targets, which are invulnerable to machine gun fire, the player must utilise secondary, explosive weaponry: grenades and rockets</desc>

		<desc>After the success of Cannon Fodder, a sequel was inevitable. The basic gameplay remained the same – guide a team of soldiers through a succession of levels populated by trees, huts and lakes. 

The major change is that the plot involves time travel, rather than straightforward war situations, and this means levels taking place in different scenarios including a strange ‘Alien Planet’. 

The levels include a variety of vehicles such as jeeps, tanks and helicopters, which can be used to shoot or even run down enemy soldiers. Standard bullets are joined by collectible grenades – use these wisely, as nothing else can destroy huts or vehicles. Finding strategic defence positions can be vital as well.</desc>

		<desc>This is the first light-gun game for the Commodore Amiga.  The action takes place in the Capone era of 1920s Chicago.  The player is a lone gunman battling Capone’s men down the streets and alleys of the city.  The game plays much like Operation Wolf.   As the game progresses, the screen scrolls sideways and evil gangsters pop up from behind windows and buildings.  The player must take care not to hit innocent bystanders, including women, children, and pets strolling down the street.  There are also two indoor scenes, including a warehouse filled with TNT and the finale that takes place inside a bank.  Capone was released in the early years of the Amiga, and had a very unique look for its time.

Although the major selling point of Capone was it was the first light-gun game available for the Amiga, players could also play entirely with a mouse.  During mouse play, a cross-hair cursor appears on screen.  Firing is accomplished simply by hitting the mouse button, or trigger on the light-gun.</desc>

		<name>Captain Blood</name>
		<desc>Captain Blood (L?Arche du Captain Blood in France) is the name of a French video game from 1988 made by ERE Informatique (soon relabeled with their short-lived Exxos label) and released by Infogrames. It was later re-released in the UK by Players Premier Software. The title tune is a stripped down version of "Ethnicolor" by Jean Michel Jarre.

The titular character of the game is a 1980s video game designer, Bob Morlock, who had picked "Captain Blood" as a nickname in tribute to the film starring Errol Flynn of the same name. Morlock develops a new video game about aliens and space travel. While testing for the first time his new project, he becomes warped inside the spaceship of the very game he had designed. Soon after, Blood is forced to go into hyperspace mode and, due to an incident, gets accidentally cloned 30 times. For 800 years, Blood tracks down every clone, as each one took a portion of his vital fluid. When the game begins, Blood successfully disintegrated 25 clones but he needs to kill the last five clones who turned out to be the most difficult to track down or he will lose his last connections with the human species.</desc>

		<desc>Surprises donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come much more extreme than the one youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve just had. The other day you were trotting into hospital ready for your tonsil operation. Dead easy you thought. Just a couple of days with a sore throat. It came as a bit of a shock to wake up in a new body on a different planet. Since youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re trapped, you decide you might as well sigh up with the QueenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cloned Highlanders troopers.

Your first mission involves you fighting your way through the multi-level enemy base, alone or with your partner (you need tow players if you want to win), to destroy the master computer. Pass codes and switch systems, open doorways and operate lifts. By the way, the mission is said to be impossible. Nice thought, eh?

Simulataneous two player action is just about this gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only strong point. The screen is split into two as you are forced into co-operation to negotiate your way around 22 levels of blaster-tron infested  nastiness.

Great intro sequence but poor in-game appearance with long messages that you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t speed up. The graphics represents small and poorly animated sprites with some repetitive backdrops. Loading tune is amazing, but poor in-game effects. Overall, a sub-standard search game from a company that has given us much better.</desc>

		<name>Captain Planet and the Planeteers</name>
		<desc>Captain Planet and the Planeteers was a video game released for various platforms in the early 1990s, loosely based on the environmentalist animated series, Captain Planet and the Planeteers and produced by the third party developer Mindscape Inc.

The Amiga/Atari version has five stages, one for each planeteer, and a final stage in which Captain Planet could be controlled. Each planeteer stage has at least one objective, while some had two: to clean up pollution using the planeteer's magic ring power, and/or to rescue a particular type of animal with the aid of one of the planeteer vehicles. Completing the objectives opens the exit gate for the level; touching environmental hazards or the unusual monsters in the level will lose the player a life, while failing the objective by killing any of the animals will crack the planeteer's ring depicted at the bottom of the screen (in the Amiga version), opening the level's exit gate early. The final level allows the player to control Captain Planet, who must navigate to the end of the stage by using and swapping powers held in bubbles throughout the level, before defeating one of the ecovillans, which is either Hoggish Greedly, Dr. Blight and her computer MAL, Looten Plunder and his assistant Argos Bleak, or Duke Nukem.</desc>

		<name>Cardinal of the Kremlin, The</name>
		<desc>The Cardinal of the Kremlin is a global management simulation.

It is the time of the Cold War. An American ground reconnaissance satellite discovers a strange structure near the northern border to Afghanistan. It is identified as project "Bright Star" - the Soviet laser ICBM defense system, capable of destroying satellites and airplanes with a beam of energy. At the same time, the USA is busy developing their own SDI project, code name "Tea Clipper". And as the race for the deployment of a space-based laser defense system begins, KGB and CIA agents swarm out to infiltrate the laboratories. Among them: The United States' top spy in Moscow, the Cardinal of the Kremlin.

Based on the popular novel of the same name by US author Tom Clancy, The Cardinal of the Kremlin puts you in the position of US project leader. Your task is to build, test and deploy a network of laser defense satellites before the Russians manage to do so. In this time of crisis, however, all your actions are overshadowed by the threat of espionage and treachery. The scientists that you hire may be geniuses, but are they trustworthy? The more technology tests you schedule, the easier it is for Russian spies to steal your knowledge. If you tighten up security on the other hand, the overprotection will throttle research efficiency. As you race against time and an invisible enemy, the word "paranoia" gains a whole new quality.

Luckily, the counter-intelligence department is at your command, too. CIA agents in Moscow not only supply you with information on the Soviet project's progress, but also on KGB operations in the USA. How accurate the reports are, however, is for you to judge. You must also supply the Afghan warlords Archer with weapons and equipment, as only he can launch a desperate attack on the Bright Star base that will hopefully throw back the Soviet project for months. You conduct battles in a simple top-down action sequence.</desc>

The actual graphics when throwing the javelin, sprinting, hurdling, long and high jumping, have been designed and recreated from live video footage. This is apparent when you first see the animation as it really is top notch.</desc>

		<desc>You are Carlos, a fat man wearing a black beard and bright coverall. You start your travels accompanied by a parrot in the jungles full of animals. During the game you should jump your way through 5 different levels full of different inhabitants (such as clowns, rats, monkeys, golf-players, etc.), climbing the ladders, entering the passageways to teleport to another locations, using the supporting devices (such as powder kegs to jump higher), collecting the different kinds of useful items from the chests, killing the enemies jumping over them, blowing them away summoning the limited amount of whirlwinds in the visible area, or morphing to the bull for limited amount of times. The parrot is flying over you and helping you to eliminate the flying enemies. On each level you have to gather the keys to open the gates, push some switches or levers, and collect certain items for some kind of picture.</desc>

		<name>Carrier Command</name>
		<desc>Carrier Command was one of the first real-time strategy games.

You control an advanced cybernetic aircraft carrier complete with fighters, amphibious assault vehicles, laser defenses and a fleet of decoy drones.  Your mission is to build a series of resource, factory, and defensive bases spanning an island chain.  The only problem?  At the other end of the chain is an even more advanced carrier under control of a terrorist organization with the same mission.

As you move around the islands you must decide what facilities to build and where they will best support your advance.  Resource islands provide materials that factory islands can use to build weapons and vehicles to replace your combat losses but both will be quickly overrun if the enemy attacks them while you are not present.  You also have to ensure that your stockpiles of equipment are stored safely until you can find time to launch a resupply drone to bring them to your carrier.

From your carrier, you can take first person control of your attack aircraft and amphibious tanks and use them to assault enemy islands or even the enemy carrier itself if you're lucky enough to find it.  The weapon payloads on your vehicles are completely configurable based on your needs.  An island invasion may require launching a virus bomb that will take over the enemy command systems or just blasting the base with a wire guided surface to surface missile.

Ultimately, you have to find and destroy the enemy carrier but, doing so will require a solid supply infrastructure and a strategy for depriving your opponent of his.</desc>

		<desc>Defending the ancient Carthagean Empire from Roman invasion is your challenge in this arcade-strategy fusion.

Your armies can be supported by catapult and elephant-mounted units, but only if these are already available and you find them first (building doesn't really come into play). Guarding the hills also gives you an advantage in combat.

Each unit becomes more skilled and happy if they win battles, but fatigue comes into play if they fight too frequently. You need to pay for the soldiers, which is done by producing goods to trade.

Actually distributing the cash appropriately involves transporting it via chariots, which improbably leads to an arcade racing-type sequence in which you must avoid not only rocks and trees, but also Roman chariots (why they are heading in the same direction as you every single time needs explanation) - contact loses you money.</desc>

The objective of the game was to drive over every platform in the level which changed the platform in some way (for example, in the construction zone the platforms are girders with holes for rivets. A rivet would appear in the hole once it was driven over), once every platform was run over Arnie would be picked up by a helicopter and taken to the next level. At the end of three levels, Arnie would rescue an animal friend and continue on to the next themed level.</desc>

This is an isometric arcade-adventure. You control a party of four brave warriors who each have their own individual strengths and weaknesses, and you must fight your way through five castles filled with bad guys. You can only control one character at a time, though, and the others will follow the character under your control.

The game was fun enough to play, and the presentation is good, with some nice music in the background and unremarkable, but cute, graphics. All in all, Castle Kingdoms is an okay game - for an hour or two.

The game is available as a part of a couple of compilations: Mutantology (Epic Marketing), and Mutation Gold (Mutation Software).</desc>

Gameplay combines action and puzzle-solving, across four primary towers with three levels each. Doors must be opened using one of the ten included keys. These are unmarked, as are the various potions - making it a challenge to know which keys open which doors, and which potions are beneficial. 

Contact with ghouls drains your energy, as does falling too far (there are narrow pathways to negotiate), while eating cheese can replenish this. Movement and aiming are controlled separately.</desc>

A vampire hunter named Simon Belmont bravely ventures into the Count's mansion in order to defeat him. Along the way he'll have to defeat skeletons, bats, fishmen, medusa heads and other evil creatures.

Castlevania is a side-scrolling platform action game. The player taking the role of Simon Belmont is able to jump and crack his whip directly in front of him. Power-ups can be obtained by defeating enemies or by whipping candles that appear in the castle. One such power-up increases the power and length of Simon's whip.  Different weapons can be gathered which consume hearts when used, these hearts can also be collected from monsters and candles. Additionally, some walls will hide secrets such as the health-restorative turkey or the Double and Triple shot abilities for the weapons Simon has collected. At the end of each section of the castle is a boss, which must be defeated. Progression through the castle eventually leads to a confrontation with Count Dracula himself.</desc>

Hordes of monkeys have escaped from the zoo, and he must return them, alive. He does this by tempting them with bananas, of which he has a finite supply, before hitting them with a baseball bat to stun them (logically, tranquillizer darts would make more sense, but this way the game involves getting close to the monkeys, making things tougher), before boxing them up (again, the number of boxes is limited) to return safely to the zoo.

The levels on which this must be done consist of a number of platforms, ladders, ledges and the like, and are played against a time limit. Falls stun Jeff, potentially allowing the monkeys time to escape, or drop banana skins to disrupt him.</desc>

		<name>Cattivik - The Videogame</name>
		<desc>Cattivik is an Italian comic book series created by cartoonist Bonvi and later continued by Silver. It is a parody of Diabolik, another Italian comic, in that the protagonist is a stupid, selfish, ill-mannered and hapless thief, as opposed to Diabolik's "gentleman thief" reputation.

In this video game adaptation the player controls Cattivik, who must burglar homes, art galleries, banks etc. in a series of puzzle-platforming levels. The goal of each level is to get rid of all the people inside the room, including hosts, dogs and security guards. Cattivik cannot directly attack the enemies, but must instead set traps for them and use the environment to his own advantage, as in the likes of Bonanza Bros. and Spy vs Spy. The player starts with a limited amount of traps including explosive mice, bombs, portable holes, jack-in-the-box toys and banana peels. Elements of the environment that Cattivik can use include lifts, poles, furniture (which can be used to block the enemies' path or dropped on their heads) and levers that activate fireplaces, trap doors and hydraulic presses. Scattered around each room are other useful items such as roller skates, pogo sticks and parachutes. Cattivik is vulnerable to his own traps, as well as to enemy contact and falls from high places, each costing one of his lives.

Once a room is cleared of enemies, Cattivik has a limited time to ransack it for valuables, which are worth points that ultimately grant extra lives. More traps can be gained by playing bonus whack-a-mole games between stages.</desc>

Cedric takes the basic adventure game elements of object manipulation, puzzle solving, and conversations involving choosing from a range of pre-set sentences. However, it sets them in an arcade platform context. The options are hidden most of the time, and there’s a fair supply of bad guys to be dispatched, either with a sword or by jumping on their heads. There are 11 levels of this to negotiate, with lots of jumps to navigate. Extra lives and improved weapons can be collected along the way.</desc>

		<name>Centurion : Defender of Rome</name>
		<desc>Starting as a young Roman legionnaire in 275BC, your job is to conquer the known world through force or diplomacy, fighting on land and sea. 

Centurion: Defender of Rome is a turn-based strategy game. You start with one province, Rome, and one legion. To complete the game, you have to conquer all the provinces on the map. 

One part of the game is micro-managing your provinces. You set up tax rates and make people happy by organizing games. In Rome, you can organize a chariot race, a gladiatorial combat or even a simulated naval battle; this starts an action mini-game where you control the chariot rider, gladiator or ship. 

Another part of the game is military conquest. You can raise legions or strengthen them in any province you control (let's just hope there are enough men in the province, or your legion will be incomplete and weaker). There are three types of legions, each of them has a different strength. You can also move a legion to a neighbouring province. 

When you enter a province you don't yet control, you can speak with the ruler there. With luck, you can convince him to give you the province for free; but this isn't very likely, and you'll often have to fight. 

When your legion attacks a province, or defends one of your provinces from an invader, the game switches to an isometric view of the battlefield. You can give orders to your legion (assuming they are within the range of their commander's voice) and watch as they duke it out with the enemy forces. Eventually, one of the sides will be completely wiped out or panic and retreat. 

Finally, you can buy warships and have naval battles with the enemy fleet. This is represented as an action mini-game, depicting a duel of the flagships; however, the outcome of the battle actually depends on the strength of your fleet.</desc>

For every hit the game shows a 3D and overhead view of the situation, so the player can plan the next steps accordingly. The golf game itself is menu driven: the player changes various parameters, e.g. the golf club, the direction, the golfer's position, the strength and if the ball is hit in the middle or an outer edge. According to those parameters the game calculates the hit, which even may result in a straight miss, and then the next planning phase starts. The player may play a championship with all 18 holes or a training round with a single hole.</desc>

		<desc>This racing game has a similar structure to Continental Circus, as in the first race you must finish no worse than 76th out of the 100 computer cars, but in each successive race, you must do more to qualify, although there are still 100 cars. You must be careful not to run off track, or into the other cars, as this causes the car to slow.

Your car has 3 gears, and you push fire while accelerating to go up a gear, and push it while braking to go down (which makes it harder to recover speed after an incident). The circuits are full of hairpins, traffic (not all of it in direct contest with you for position) and hills - rising over those can be precarious. The races are over 4 laps, and each lap's timing is displayed on screen, along with the distance left to complete this lap.</desc>

		<desc>The War of the Lance is over, the dragon armies have been defeated. But evil has not left Krynn. In northeastern Ansalon, outposts of the Knights of Solamnia remain to guard the fragile peace. Your party of adventurers is hired to carry out missions for the Knights. On your first mission, you stumble upon Draconians, long believed to have left the area. What are their plans? On your travels you have to face dangers in many dungeons and towns and might even meet some of the legendary Heroes of the Lance.

Champions of Krynn is the first of SSI's "gold box" games set in the AD&amp;D world of Dragonlance, with all the usual features: first-person view and movement in dungeons, towns and outposts, overland travel on a map of the area and tactical turn-based combat from a top-down perspective.

As the first game set in Krynn, it has several features unique to that setting: In character races, one can choose from Kender, Silvanesti or Qualinesti Elves and Mountain or Hill Dwarves in addition to humans and half-elves. Special character classes include Solamnic Knights, clerics of the major deities of Krynn and mages of either the Red or the White Robe. The deities grant special spells and powers to their respective clerics. Red and White mages have access to different spells and the phases of the moons of Krynn affect their spellcasting abilities.</desc>

Unfortunately not everything went to plan after that. During the confusion the Baron snuck away back into his own contraption and into another time period. Our two heroes decide the only way to stop him is follow him, but unfortunately luck isn't on their side...

Both players (either two human or one human and one computer controlled) are trapped within the Chaos Engine and can only escape by helping the Baron rebuild the engine. He will reward the character who helps him the most by granting him freedom, thus pitching our two heroes against each other.

Whereas The Chaos Engine was a two-player co-operative game, The Chaos Engine 2 is a two-player competitive game!</desc>

The most important part is exploring the map from a top-down perspective. Interactions with the world or in-game menus are conducted by using one of the symbols which are placed on the border around the playing screen, e.g. talking to other characters which may provide clues. Unfortunately there are also enemies roaming on the planet which, because movement happens in real-time, may be avoided or fought on a separate battle screen - later in the game helpful android can be used during combat. The player character can divide points on character statistics like strength or wisdom.</desc>

		<name>Charlie J Cool</name>
		<desc>Charlie J. Cool is Platform game, developed by Nevada and published by NRC, which was released in Europe in 1996.

Game plots are usually terrible. This oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brilliant. Walking down the street one day, Charles gets crushed by a falling grand piano, dies and goes into the Netherworld. Which is somewhere, but not really anywhere. So he has to trudge through 28 rather similar levels of platform merriment to get back from somewhere. Which isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really anywhere.

In the tradition of platform games, the idea is to dodge, jump, collect and kill across seven worlds (including the odd bonus room) of horizontally-scrolling action, picking up keys along the way to gain access to the next level. Despite the changes of scenery, the application remains the same. Oh, and there are coins to collect, though IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sure why. Interestingly, the number of goodies you collect or baddies you kill determines where you end up - altering the end sequence accordingly. Stunningly average stuff, indeed. An A500 version is also available.</desc>

Built into the program is a pull-down menu, giving it's performance against Chessmaster 2000, Chessmaster 2100 and Colossus X, in 10 games apiece.

The game was designed to improve as it played, so over time a game that played against good players would be much better than when it first began. Users have the option of saving, so that the gained intelligence isn't lost.

The game includes classic and whimsical chess pieces, one set includes farm animals (sheep pawns, dog rooks, horse knights, chicken bishops, cow queens, and pig kings). Another setting includes Science-Fiction pieces that look like aliens. The game can be played in 2D or 3D, and includes digitised speech.</desc>

		<name>Chrono Quest 2</name>
		<desc>This is a sequel to Chrono Quest, part of a series of games called Explora in their original French releases. After the events of the first game, you attempt to return to France of 1922, your own time period. A disorder on Explora, your time-machine, makes it use up all its metal fuel, leaving you stranded on an unknown time era. You need to find enough metal for Explora to be able to return you to your place in time. The original point-and-click interface (text-based with auxiliary icons) was replaced by a fully icon driven one. There's a row of icons at the bottom of the screen with movement arrows, a save game icon, "get", "give", "examine", etc. The conversations with characters have a basic form of speech-synthesis which can be turned off (the full text of the dialogue is displayed either way). The game boasts 13 different locations and multiple time stages.</desc>

		<desc>Chrono Quest is an adventure game told in still images and text windows. Controls are implemented by various icons around the screen border. The gameplay basically is somewhere in between modern point&amp;click adventures and graphics-supplemented interactive fiction. The plot starts off some time around 1920 in the mansion of the main character's father, which was murdered and left the protagonist as the main suspect. In the course of exploring the mansion, the player finds a time machine and starts tracking down his father's murderer through the ages...</desc>

		<desc>Chuckie Egg II is a sequel to platformer game Chuckie Egg, but is very different from the original game.  Whereas the original game features eight levels of one screen each, this features many more screens arranged into a maze for you to explore.

In the game, Hen House Harry must build a giant chocolate egg, with the ingredients (cocoa, milk and sugar), that are found in the factory.  Eight of each must be included.  Also, the eight parts of a toy kit must be found, to place inside the egg.

In order to get all the items you must find your way around the factory, avoiding many types of enemy, and solving puzzles using various items that you can carry.  There are a number of ways to get around the factory, including the platforms of the original, but also ropes and pipes, among other things.

Despite the drastic changes from the original, the game still retains the sound effects from the original.</desc>

		<name>Chuckie Egg</name>
		<desc>In the game you play Hen House Harry who has to collect 12 (a dozen) eggs from each level, while avoiding the ducklings. The levels each occupy a single screen, and are made up of platforms, ladders and lifts (or elevators), and are thus similar to those in classic platform game Donkey Kong. Corn can also be collected, which stops the time limit from ticking down and also stops the bonus, collected when the level is completed, from decreasing. The ducklings also eat the corn, however.

There are only 8 distinct levels. The ninth level is a copy of level 1, the tenth is a copy of level 2, and so on. However, on the second time around the ducklings that can use the platforms and ladders are replaced by the Mother Duck, who can fly around the level going through the platforms and ladders. On the third time around, you have to face both the Mother Duck and the ducklings, and similarly on subsequent goes round, when there are more ducklings.</desc>

		<name>Chuck Rock 2 : Son of Chuck</name>
		<desc>The story in this Chuck Rock game takes up a little while after the end of the first game. As you may remember, Chuck Rock had to rescue his girl, Ophelia from the bad dude Gary Gritter. Well, he was successful in his efforts, and now Chuck and Ophelia are married. Eventually, they have a son, named Junior. Chuck works in a factory, where he develops great skill at carving automobiles out of stone. A rival manufacturer becomes jealous of Chuck's abilities and kidnaps him. Now it is up to Junior to rescue his dad!

The gameplay in this sequel is similar to the first game, but with some minor differences since you are playing as Junior, rather than Chuck. This is a side-scrolling platform game with occasional rock-moving puzzles thrown in. Unlike Chuck, Junior carries a club that gives his attacks further reach.</desc>

		<desc>A revolt on a distant prison island must be foiled by you in this first-person shoot ?em up. Reaching the control room will suffice, but a further challenge of finding the six pieces of a hidden bomb can be undertaken if you?re brave.

The game features texture-mapped visuals and a variable screen size, making it suited to anything from a humble A500 (most Doom-style games needed at least an A1200) or a well-accelerated machine.

The prison complex is on several levels, with teleporters linking different sections, and the chance to reach the final control room via several different paths. You don?t get a weapon at the start of the game, and ammunition is in shorter supply than usual, meaning that you can?t just shoot randomly and hope for the best. Another way of killing people off is to set them on fire</desc>

The A1200 version looks and plays even better with a beefed-up graphics palette and stereo sound samples. The overall look of the game has been changed in a subtle way - waves lap the shore on the map screens while the animations have become smoother and more detailed. The sound effects also help to boost the game's realism with strident martial music when you come under attack, or hammering sounds when you're building one of the world's Great Wonders.</desc>

You start with 9 lives, which sounds generous, but the levels are full of spikes and bad guys which can come to get you at any point.

You start with nine lives, but the game's design is such that a lot of deaths will be unexpected, so prior knowledge of the layouts is essential to get through most sections of the five levels without losing lives. The two-player mode involves the screen following the lead player, so the latter can lose lives by getting too far behind. With lots of precise jumps across vertically-progressing ledges involved, a lot of skill and timing is required.</desc>

Your task on each level is to use a number of gears of one of 3 different sizes to ensure that all the cogs are linked together. All this has to be completed before the engine overheats.

Making life harder are two creatures with the peculiar name "Poffins". One of these goes around removing pegs, and the other causes the engine to overheat further. They can be shot out of the way, or have gears placed over them to stop them.

There's also a bonus round, which is a fruit machine, only with cogs and other things from the game rather than fruit.</desc>

There are lots of special blocks to help out, including bombs, diamond-producers and anti-gravity blocks.

Each level has its own password, which makes progression a little easier.</desc>

		<name>Cloud Kingdoms</name>
		<desc>Baron von Bansai has stolen Terry's precious collection of crystals, and dropped them onto 32 different kingdoms, so Terry sets off to retrieve them. Viewed from above, his challenge sees him having to progress through these worlds, collecting keys to gain access to different sections, and avoiding enemy balls and bugs by jumping them where possible. There are no 'lives' as such, but there's a strict time limit of around 400 seconds for the whole game, and death puts you back to the start of the level, with time lost as well. You get an extra 80 seconds for completing each level though.

The levels feature all manner of further hazards - there are holes in the ground to avoid falling through (some visible, some hidden), arrows which force the ball in a particular direction, slippery squares making any movement's effect exaggerated, magneted squares making it impossible to jump from, and many more. Fortunately lots of power-ups, time boosts and bonus fruits are dropped onto the levels at random intervals as well.

To complete the game you must clear 8 levels, and the structure is non-linear - initially you have a choice of 4 levels, and after completing one of those you have a choice of 4 more levels (which are different depending on which level you completed first). The third and fourth levels you take on as you go through the game are chosen from a choice of 3, the fifth and sixth from a choice of two, and only those final two levels are perscribed (although they do vary depending on which levels you've already done).

Each of the 32 worlds has its own twist - Arrow Kingdom has a large amount of arrows directing you, Ice Kingdom is especially slippery, Unseen Kingdom leaves you to work out the route for yourself (other than the holes, which are all you can see), Box Kingdom involves a lot of flying over some trapped squares to grab the keys they contain before making the main jumps onto the sections which contain crystals, and so on.</desc>

		<desc>In Clown-O-Mania the player takes the role of the clown Beppo who leaves his old profession behind in search of the land of magic crystals. To reach it, he needs to solve 82 isometric levels by collecting all balls and diamonds spread out over the tiles. The levels also have different plains which are changed by either using a ladder or jumping. However, jumps and shots for his gun need to be picked up first - which is made more difficult by the fact that the symbols move over the level. Over the course of the game the difficulty and complexity rises at a steady rate, e.g. at first there are no enemies, later the enemies walk on pre-defined ways and even further down the path they actively try to hunt down Beppo. It also introduces more and more gameplay elements along the way, e.g. one-way tiles, teleports, funnels, speed-up tiles or death tiles. Some tiles change their colour when walking over them and having them all in the same colour when finishing the level gives major bonus points. Also useful are two different pyramids which stop or kill enemies when dropped in their way.</desc>

		<desc>Despite the name conjuring up images of a cutesy platform creature, your charge in this game is in fact a helicopter armed to the teeth. The game requires at least a 68020 processor, which is understandable considering the amount of action going on at times, and the speed and visual detail this is conveyed in. It was one of the few Amiga games to include a Virtual Cockpit mode, and this can be controlled using the mouse with a quick button press.

The game’s missions are set up in such a way that you are not necessarily the lead man. The two sides fight each other irrespective of your placement, and act on instinct with unusually complex AI, meaning that the exact nature of the missions vary each time you play. The missions all involve shooting at the enemy planes, helicopters and tanks though, and there is no particular war structure in terms of the mission orders</desc>

		<desc>Cobra is not quite as bad as in this horror scenario - but almost! In the first stage you can see an old man standing on a bridge and throwing like a boomerang thing at you. Every touch with the thing costs energy. However, the fact that it is almost impossible to avoid them gives the game the very special charm that can even rip the eyes out of the most intrepid black belt carrier...

If you can beat the rabid pensioner, you land again on a bridge, but in a bonus level. This is not a fight. Instead, the hero must bend hard and capture as many flying fish as possible. This sounds so simple and is (again) so incredibly difficult, that one could become a vegetarian. You have to catch a certain number of raft fishies within a short period of time, otherwise you can start again from the beginning!

The remaining sections offer other opponents, like punks and a domino with whip, but in terms of playability they are all in agreement. We were also in agreement: Despite satisfactory graphics, solid sound, a lot of striking techniques (fist blow, foot sweep, gauntlet, etc.), Cobra is not a winner!</desc>

		<name>Code-Name: Iceman</name>
		<desc>In the beginning of the 21st century, Earth is experiencing a global oil shortage. Surprisingly, Tunisia remains one of the few countries still in possession of large quantities of high-quality oil. USA and Soviet governments race each other in their attempts to purchase as much oil as possible. Finally, the Soviets take a step further and kidnap the US ambassador, hoping to provoke an international incident. Naval Officer Johnny Westland is sent to Tunisia with the order of rescuing the ambassador and preventing further escalation of the conflict.

Code-Name: Iceman is primarily an adventure game similar to Sierra's other works in that genre. The player navigates the protagonist in eight different directions from third-person view, and types text commands to interact with the environment. The command "Look" may be typed separately and lead to different text descriptions depending on where on screen the protagonist is positioned. The game is similar to Police Quest series in that it relies on realistic procedures, in this case military instructions, first aid, etc. The player may reach dead ends and resort to restoring an earlier save if some of these procedures are not followed properly. In addition, a considerable portion of the game consists of submarine simulation, requiring the player to navigate a submarine and fight enemy craft.</desc>

		<name>Coloris</name>
		<desc>Coloris is a Puzzle game, developed by Signum Victoriae and published by Avesoft, which was released in Europe in 1990.

This is a puzzle game similar to Columns. The player has to deal with falling down blocks which are divided into three parts (stacked up vertically). These parts have one of five colours which can be rotated by using a button (for example if the combination is white-blue-red it becomes red-white-blue). The goal is to create lines of three or more parts of the same colour. When they vanish, above lying parts fall down and may create a chain reaction.

All this rewards points and if enough of those are gained, the player gets access to a fallback-feature: slowing down the falling speed of the current block. However, this only lasts for a short time and costs points. A game ends if the blocks reach the upper part of the screen. Additional to the normal playing mode, there is a second one in which random blocks get added to the lower side of the screen in regular intervals.</desc>

The circuits are based on real ones, although the opposition (of which there are 9) are known simply by first names such as David and Paul.

The display appears to use real 3D, with some fairly terrifying directional changes, although it doesn't tilt as you turn. A full map of your position relative to your rivals is presented at the top of the screen. Crashes cause gradual engine damage, reducing your initial 140mph top speed by a slight amount each time - you'll also lose time as you rejoin. Before each race you must set a qualifying lap, which allows you multiple attempts.

The game has a built-in track editor.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the Avalon Hill boardgame, Third Reich lets you play not only as Hitler and his staff, but also as the allied powers. The scenario is limited to the European theatre.

The game is played in rounds of three months, split into several phases such as declaration of war, movement, battle and construction.

You begin the game by declaring war. Which front you open up first will determine the further development of the war. Warring nations are split into two kinds – great military powers such as the allies and the axis, and neutral states.

One resource to be househeld with is your gross national product. This is the resource that will be expended when you build up your armies, and eventually send them to war.

The game has a multitude of scenarios, each with its own goals; just killing your enemy is not the best way to win, if at all.

Just as in the board game, the action takes place on a hexagon map of Europe.</desc>

		<name>Conan: The Cimmerian</name>
		<desc>Conan: The Cimmerian was living happily as a blacksmith with his wife in the village of Irskuld, Cimmeria...until one fateful day. A group of horsemen raided his village...Conan was knocked unconscious, awakening only to find his wife and his friends butchered in the aftermath. Conan discovers architect of the slaughter was a wizard named Thoth Amon, a high priest of Cult of Set. Sword in hand, vengeance aflame, Conan now travels south in the land of Hyborea to the city of Shadizar. Here his journey of vengeance begins...

Conan: The Cimmerian is an action-adventure game with some RPG elements. The game is divided into 3 areas. The first is the overland map, where Conan may travel only between identifiable town and other locations. The second is the town map, here Conan is viewed in a horizontal 3rd Person and the last is the combat screen (or when he enters houses) where Conan is viewed in vertical 3rd Person. Conan may also view his character status and inventory sheet, anytime during the course of the game.

Gameplay consists of exploration and combat. The exploration element in the game sets Conan to find his way around towns and hidden locations, often breaking in houses and searching the premises for hidden loot. Towns consist of various places to visit, among others temples which usually offer quests, shops offering weapons and other items, and inns to stay for a health boost. NPC’s may be conversed with to seek information, while the tougher-looking types may be provoked into combat.

Combat is real-time, one-on-one with Conan on the left and the opponent on the right, consisting of only movement to the left or right and attacking. There are no defensive maneuvers. Both must now keep on attacking until the health bar of either side drops to zero. If Conan wins, he may search the remains and may find loot. At the beginning of the game, Conan may only use one sword style (swing) out of three available sword styles. Additional sword styles may be trained by a sword master.</desc>

		<name>Conflict : Europe</name>
		<desc>Essentially an update of 8-bit game Theatre Europe, your task is again to play World War 3 scenarios fighting as NATO vs the Warsaw Pact. 

The game uses pretty basic handling. While you can access some menus as the bottom of the screen you can see the map on the main part of the screen where each unit is indicated as small square. Your aim, of course, is to eliminate all the enemy units.

Some special actions can be selected, like deploying special units, attack with chemical weapons or even nuclear ones.</desc>

		<name>Conflict: The Middle East Simulation</name>
		<desc>Another in the continuing series of war games fostered by SSI, Conflict: Middle East concentrates on an area previously only touched on by games in the genre. Specifically, the ongoing tumultuous conflict between Israel and the Arab states sets the scene for this narrowly focused look at the 1973 Yom Kippur War. In a genuinely innovative move, the designers also include a "what if" scenario that presupposes an early 1990's full blown attack by the Arabs in an attempt to eliminate the Israelis. The game is a solid effort in many areas and provides experienced gamers with a challenging test of strategic planning and theater command skills. Novice war gamers would be advised to put this one on hold until they've had time to work up a solid understanding of turn-based, hex-based war games and can sort out the intricacies and overwhelming potential of excruciatingly detailed and complex scenarios. If nothing else, Conflict: Middle East requires, at a minimum, veteran war gamers to plumb the depths of game play.</desc>

		<desc>Conqueror is a polygonal isometric-view tank action/strategy game with an elaborate control system (emulating "real" tank controls on normal joysticks) and two-player possibilities by switching the controls to use one joystick each for gunner and driver. The goal of the game is generally to destroy all enemy tanks on the map using a preset squad of tanks of your own. The tanks on the player's side that aren't controlled by the player act on AI, but the player-controlled tank can be switched at will via an in-game map. Alternately, the player can use that map to direct tanks to other places - but even when planning troop movements on the map, the game goes on. To top things off, there is also a limited amount of resources allocated to the player and can be gained by destroying enemies; these resources can then be used to buy new tanks before the start of the next mission.</desc>

		<name>Conquests of Camelot - The Search for the Grail</name>
		<desc>It is the ninth century, and Camelot, the legendary castle ruled by King Arthur, has fallen under a curse. Famine and drought plague the kingdom because of the love triangle between the king, his wife Gwenhyver, and the knight Launcelot. It appears that only the mysterious Holy Grail can restore Camelot, and three knights - Launcelot, Gawaine, and Galahad - embark on a journey to find it, and soon disappear without trace. King Arthur leaves his castle in search of the missing knights, hoping to locate the Grail as well. His quest takes him to real and mythical locations in England, and later to Jerusalem and other areas of the Holy Land.

Conquests of Camelot is an adventure game that requires the player to input text commands, mostly by combining verbs and objects (such as "look man", "take purse", etc.). A few commands (such as "ask about") have keyboard shortcuts. Unlike most other adventures, the game does not focus extensively on inventory-based puzzles. Rather, it presents a diverse array of tasks depending on concrete situations. These involve exploration, solving riddles, gathering information, participating in arcade sequences such as jousting, and others. Rudimentary money management is present as well. 

Many problems have different solutions, and it is possible to reach the final part of the game even without having completed some of the essential quests (e.g. failing to save the knights). However, Arthur is being judged by the game in three different categories: skill (referring to the action sequences), wisdom (evaluating the amount of cultural information gathered), and soul (determining the moral value of Arthur's action). Failure to achieve a high score in the last category leads to a bad ending.

The game is set in a concrete historical period, but adds an alternate reality to it, assuming that pagan deities really existed, but were overshadowed by Christian worship. However, there are only a few references to real religious practices of the time or any historical characters.</desc>

On the way, he is ambushed and abducted by the soldiers of the Austrian duke Leopold. The duke demands a large ransom to be paid in exchange for the king's freedom. However, the king's brother, Prince John, is content with the situation and plotting to take the throne for himself. That is when the legendary Robin Hood, one who robs from the rich and gives to the poor, decides to raise the money needed to liberate the king, with the help of his fellow outlaws of Sherwood Forest.</desc>

The first race is in Brazil and features 100 cars, and requires you to finish in the top 80 in order to qualify for  next race. As you work through the 8 races the size of the field steadily decreases, but so does the worst acceptable finishing position to qualify.

The car has high and low gears, and is susceptible to damage from contact with another car. Once you hit a car or a piece of the trackside scenery you will be called into the pits - fail to make it back, or hit another car, and you will crash and lose several seconds.</desc>

Cool Croc Twins has been very well presented (you even get a free T-shirt in the box!) and fortunately has been very well written as well. A level return-code facility (which lets you skip all the bits you've done before) and the simultaneous two-player head-to-head mode makes it a game which won't just get put away. Eventually it will lose its appeal because of the lack of variety or different screens. An in-built screen designer would have made it a brilliant package but as it stands, Cool Croc Twins is still very, very good.</desc>

On the first one, you will be on a wild island, a place in which we will have to face endless hordes of pirates whose only obsession will be killing us. Some of them will use all kind of deadly weapons, such as the famous saber or a blunderbuss. Luckily for us and unfortunately for them, our protagonist is quite capable when it comes to fight with punches and kicks. So if all goes well, you will find a small boat which is awaiting you at the other extreme of the island.

The second part, to which we can access without the need of finishing the first one, takes place in a pirate galleon. There we will have to represent the role of the hero once again and we should try to rescue the beautiful damsel. Now the game system is quite different from the first part, because we will be no longer able to directly blow our enemies, but we will have to use a sword to finish with all of them. The objective consists in ascending to the pirate flags which are in the different masts of the ship and, in the end, to arrive where the girl is before she ends being food for sharks.</desc>

Two players race against each other on a plain and each vehicle leaves behind a trail which is deadly by touch. The goal is to trap the opponent; obviously the surviving party has won the battle. The screen is split into three parts: the upper and lower ones show a 3D view of the plain with the camera fixed on one of the two players and in the middle is a radar view.

The variants to this known principle are a limited amount of jumps, the ability to control the speed of the own vehicle and two AI difficulty levels. Regarding multiplayer, there can be only two vehicles on the field at the same time. However, more participants can start a tournament with knockout rules.</desc>

		<desc>Cosmic Bouncer is an action game similar to Bounder in which the player takes the role of a tennis ball which was made alive by a space beam caused by a computer mishap. Not only that, but it also finds itself at some distant place in the universe.

Now it has to travel through 22 automatically scrolling levels to find the way home. Movement consists of bouncing, and there are many obstacles like holes, disappearing floors or death tiles to avoid. Most platforms disappear after a touch and the player can use a limited function which creates a platform under the tennis ball. Failing a level, e.g. by falling in a hole, causes a life loss in the 11 main levels. After every level there is a shorter bonus level. It is still possible to fail the level, but instead of losing a life the player just gets teleported to the beginning.</desc>

It offers several missions to the player, all with the goal to hijack a space truck. During the course of the game the player will undertake increasingly more dangerous and difficult missions.

This game is a multi-directional shooter. For each mission the player gets transported to the estimated destination of the truck. However, the correct space sector has to be found first through the means of elimination. The player uses warp beacons to go to the next sector and when the correct one is found, the radar shows the way to the truck. 

However, every usage of a beacon costs money which is earned by shooting alien ships in the current sector, which can be freely explored in all directions. Every killed enemy gives credits and probably leaves an extra behind which gives advantages if picked up, e.g. bonus credits, a protection shield or a smart bomb. Money left after finishing a mission can be reinvested into ship upgrades.</desc>

Select one of the five most intrepid Adventurers from England, France, Germany, Japan, and the U.S. to spearhead the search. Professor Renegade was last seen in the unexplored region of the highest Tibetan ranges; an area populated by creatures and conditions of the professor's own design: venomous stone snakes, reptilian birds, and acid storms. Not only must your Adventurer survive these tests of courage, but he must and properly use such curious objects as spurs, a vacuum cleaner, and a unicycle. Once you locate the professor and convince him to help, you'll need to help him construct an anti-asteroid deflector to prevent the destruction of earth.</desc>

Your job is to help Linus make his way back to planet Earth so he can take some pictures to convince his friends. Gameplay consists of two parts, an adventure and arcade action. In adventure mode you can explore lands, find objects, and talk to people. Sentences can be constructed by using the pointer to select actions or objects on the screen (This is similar to the interface LucasArts used in games such as Maniac Mansion.) To reach many new locations involves the action mode, where you will need to cross treacherous landscapes and evade dangerous creatures. This portion resembles a side scrolling platform game. Once you've cleared an action sequence, you will not need to do so again if you decide to revisit a location. Whenever you wish you can receive a password allowing you to continue the game later from the same point.</desc>

		<desc>Count Duckula (in No Sax Please - We're Egyptian) is a 2D platformer with adventure elements. The game is based on "Count Duckula", a British animated television series.

Count Duckula with his servants Igor and Nanny have brought their European style castle to ancient Egypt. Once there they set their on the Sax, an ancient Egyptian saxophone with magical powers. The Sax is hidden in the pyramid tomb of the pharaoh Upanatem, deep in the burning desert. Cont Duckula's rivals the Crow Brothers inadvertently hitched a ride on their time travel and are preparing their own expedition to foil the vampire duck. 

Players control Duckula. The count must explore the pyramid, solving puzzles and collecting useful items, while keeping an eye out for wandering mummies and crows. Duckula must avoid the mummies, falling rocks and the Crow Brothers. If the count is touched by any of these then he is "frozen" and the clock advances by one hour. Duckula can pick up various useful items; if you don't want an item then Duckula must jump over it. Duckula can carry only up to three items.</desc>

The playersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ bat here is made out to look like a bone, and the ball is a spherical stone. Level backdrops are randomised pixel-painted scenes featuring different types of Dinosaurs. 

The bricks to knock out sometimes contain pickups to collect, such as a laser gun, an automatic CPU controlled bat navigation mode, extra life, slow-ball etc. A pickup is immediately activated upon collection, but subsequent ones collected are not if one is active, and clicking the right mouse button will cancel out the current effect for the last pickup collected.

A bonus coconut game can be enabled from the main menu, which in turn lets you play this sub-game at predefined intervals during the course of standard play, where you control a caveman holding a pan, and the object is to catch coconuts that fall from trees with it, by moving from left to right on the single screen. Your bonus is tallied for how many coconuts you managed to catch in the allotted time.</desc>

		<name>Crazy Seasons</name>
		<desc>Crazy Seasons is an arcade game about two cute penguin scientists who are working on a time machine on their space station when their computer crashes (poking fun at the Amiga's "Guru Meditation" crash screen), which threatens to create a temporal anomaly and mixing up the Earth's seasons. It is up to the two penguins to rearrange the blocks powering the time machine in order to avert the catastrophe.

The gameplay is very reminiscent of Taito's Bubble Bobble and Parasol Stars: the penguins are respectively blue and green and move around single-screen levels defeating a variety of cute enemies which leave food and valuables behind when killed. The twist here is that the goal of each screen is not to clear every enemy, but rather to arrange four blocks bearing four distinct geometrical shapes in a specific pattern shown on the bottom of the screen, which changes for every level. The blocks are also the main weapon at the player's disposal, as they can be pushed into enemies to defeat them. Occasionally, a bonus may appear which gives the penguins a gunman hat and revolver, to make dispatching the baddies easier. The game presents a boss fight every few levels, ranging to farm animals to dragons. Aside from the tunes composed specifically for the game, the music also includes 16-bit remixes of Vivaldi's Four Seasons, coherently with the game's title and premise. In between the various seasons, the game offers a few entertaining cutscenes complete with slapstick comedy.</desc>

The people of Ereanor were relieved when the brave girl Sue destroyed the horrible sorcerer "Wizard of Doom". The liberation of Ereanor was followed by a three day's celebration. But a dark shadow fell over the Kingdom of Ereanor. The sinister "Mistress of Death", the sorcerers wife, is out to get even. Ereanor became a hell on Earth. People became destructive creatures, animals became killer beasts and even plants turned evil.

Sue was not harmed by any of the spells, and from now on lived in her own world, which was worse then her scariest nightmare. To take whatever was left of Sue's pride, the mistress of death kidnapped her teddy-bear...

That really did it!  Like she did once before with the "Wizard of Doom", she now decided to fight and beat the "Mistress of Death". Help Sue, and start your battle against evil itself.</desc>

		<name>Creatures to the Rescue : Clyde Radcliffe Extermin</name>
		<desc>The inhabitants of the pretty but insignificant planet Blot decided to leave to find a trendier planet, and escape being called the Blotians, a most unhip name. Until they such a planet, they call themselves the Fuzzy Wuzzies.

Their colony ship collides with an asteroid, and crash lands in the Pacific Ocean, near an unchartered island, which they colonise, calling it "The Hippest Place in The Known Universe". Unfortunately the island is also home to rather nasty demons, who can't stand the commotion caused by the happy Fuzzies, or their silly name for the island.

The demons kidnap the Fuzzy Wuzzies by hosting a massive party, then capturing them in a net, and dragging them off to the torture chambers. The only Fuzzy not caught is Clyde Radcliff, who was already being sick in the bushes. He wakes up in the morning with a really bad headache, and fiery halitosis, and sets out to destroy the demons, and rescue his friends.

The game consists of 3 levels, each made up of 3 of stages. The first two stages of each level are side scrolling platformers, where Clyde must destroy the enemies by firing at them, presumably using his halitosis. At the end of each of these stages, Clyde meets a witch, who can provide him with extra firing patterns, or upgrade those he has, in exchange for 'magic potion creatures' found during the stages.</desc>

Responding to the distress call, you hurry to save a spaceship, a space station which has had its reactor put on self-destruct to prevent the station from falling into the enemies hands, and the lunar base that have become infested with Creatures.

The spaceship, although seemingly abandoned by the Creature, has inside, guard dogs and beastoids that fire weapons. They were left behind by their master. You must survive their attack to find life-sustaining supplies and the key to disarm the reactor. Upon receiving these, you must safely return to your ship to start your journey to the terror-filled space station. The space station has much greater danger. You must gather more essential supplies, but more importantly, you must disarm the reactor before it self-destructs. You have the key, but where is the reactor? Once this step of your mission has been done, you must make your way back out while trying to get past the alien attack droids, acid leaks, and more vicious beastoids.</desc>

It's up to you to prove the police wrong.

A difference to the classical adventure exists: you need money to travel, get information or training. To get money, you can trade at the stock market. What's also different is that the time of the day really matters and that the protagonist becomes sleepy after staying up too long.</desc>

		<name>Croak 2</name>
		<desc>This it an Amiga conversion of the classic Frogger that saw its birth in 1981. Croak 2 attempts to simulate, as accurately as possible, one of the most fascinating stages in the lifecycle of the Australian Cane Toad. As everyone knows (I didn't), the eggs of the Cane Toad are laid within the carcasses of dead sheep. The tadpoles quickly mature in this nutrient-rich environment, and soon there's a multitude of young toads, ready to begin their famous migration to the nearest creek or river bed. This journey frequently takes them across busy roads and rivers, whose erratic currents and high toxicity defy the bulky toad's best attempts at swimming.

If you can't remember, or if you have never played the game before (where have you been?), the basic idea of the game is to get your frog from one side of the road (at the bottom of the screen), over the river and into your home (at the top of the screen). To complete a level you must dodge cars and jump on logs, while avoiding snakes, alligators and otters. Bonuses are awarded for getting the bugs that momentarily appear, escorting lady frogs to their home and getting five frogs safely home.</desc>

		<name>Croak!</name>
		<desc>A variation of the classic arcade game Frogger, designed to make use of the Amiga's hardware.

The basic gameplay involves guiding a frog into one of 7 home-bases at the top of the screen, which have hard barriers either side of them (avoid these). This involves first guiding him across a road, avoiding the vehicles, then over a river using moving logs.

In this version the road has a variety of machinery to dodge, ranging from standard cars to lorries - hitting one kills your frog and leaves a red splodge in that part of the screen - a nice touch. The rivers also have families of turtles appearing intermittently - these can be used to cross a level, but they don't stay up for long. There's also a 2-player mode in which both players compete to get into the same slots - player 2 using a yellow frog.

You have a 60 second time limit for each frog on the first level, and 5 lives at the start. Once all 7 slots are filled, you get a 50-point bonus for each one, and move on to the next level. Progressively you have less and less time, more traffic, less logs, and a few other difficulty elements - the part in between the road and river has a chicken marching across to avoid, and a crow swoops overhead ready to grab your frog.</desc>

		<name>Crossbow - The Legend Of William Tell</name>
		<desc>The Legend of William Tell is based on the TV series Crossbow which in turn is based on the Swiss national hero William Tell. The player takes the role of Tell who tries to end the reign of the evil duke Gessler.

This is an action game with puzzle elements in which Tell explores the environment, talks to people and collects everything he finds. The objects are either used to solve puzzles, are a good bribe or go into Tell's equipment. This is because the forest is no friendly environment: wild animals and Gessler's black knights want to eat/arrest him. In this case Tell has to fight his way out without losing too much life energy. It can be restored by using found provisions.

Controls are almost completely icon driven. So for example for walking right, the player needs to click the "go right" icon, to pick something up the "pick up" icon needs to be pressed and so on. This includes the fights in which first the used weapon is chosen and the combat moves are performed when clicking on the appropriate icon. The only exception is the crossbow: when using it, a first-person view replaces the icon bar in which the crossbow is aimed.</desc>

		<name>Cruise for a Corpse</name>
		<desc>1927. When Inspector Raoul Dusentier is invited to a cruise upon a mighty sailing ship by the wealthy businessman Niklos Karaboudjan, he looks forward to nothing but a relaxing week on the sea. Instead, his host manages to get himself killed on the second day. Murdered, to be exact. Too convenient that a policeman is aboard -- Dusentier sets out to search for suspects. He doesn't need to search long. Why is it that none of the family members seem awfully sad about the demise of the old man? Is the mysterious Father Fabiani really as pious as he says? In the tradition of Agatha Christie, each and every person on board has a motive for the murder.</desc>

		<name>Cruncher Factory</name>
		<desc>Cruncher Factory is a Pac-Man variant. The player commands a cruncher (which looks exactly like Pac-Man) and steers him through non-scrolling labyrinths shown from the side. On every place not occupied with a wall are pills which have to be eaten by rolling over the field they are on. There are also ghosts which cause the player to lose a life when touched - at least until the cruncher eats a special ball which causes him to eat the ghosts. A level is won when all balls are eaten.

The game features 100 levels, a level editor (can be also used to change the existing levels) and a two-player mode.</desc>

		<name>Crystal Hammer</name>
		<desc>One of the Amiga's many Arkanoid clones, Crystal Hammer is perhaps best remembered by its intro tune, which has been remixed and covered by many.

The game is all about reflecting a ball against a wall of bricks. Behind the wall of bricks live some worm-like creatures that will come out to disturb you when you've opened a hole in the wall. Prolonged contact with the creatures will kill your bat. Destroying bricks will often cause a coloured brick to come spinning down slowly. These spinning bricks are power-ups, altering your ball or bat according to their colour. You can have a sticky bat (green), a wide bat (blue), a slower ball (yellow), multiple balls (cyan), and the decidedly Arkanoid-inspired shooting bat (red). Whatever you do, don't pick up the grey brick, or you will be destroyed.</desc>

		<desc>Crystal Palace is an Platform game, developed and published by Amiga Fun, which was released in Europe in 1993 on Amiga Fun Magazine as a Coverdisk. 

Quite an interesting concept, this game involves you using the sparks from your magic wand to break blocks that may be in your way. You can control where to point the wand too. Other than that, very basic. The presentation is good, in terms of graphics and music, but the actual gameplay is a bit slow-paced and difficult to get the hang of. In all fairness though, it's pretty good for a freebie.</desc>

		<desc>Mogroth, the deity of chaos, was enraged by the gods' decision to banish him from the pantheon. Plotting revenge, he began poisoning the minds of the nations of the world. Black elves and orcs became his minions. The gods flooded the land in response, secluding the island kingdom of Arborea as the last stronghold against Mogroth's forces. Jarel, the last Prince of the elf-like race of Sham-nirs, must find allies who would help him on his quest to obtain four elemental crystals, restore the power of the temples, and defeat Mogroth.

Crystals of Arborea is an RPG which is a precursor to the Ishar games. The party of six characters roam the world (on a 2D map or by exploring 3D individual locations), defeating Mogroth's minions, gathering experience points and becoming stronger. Unlike the subsequent Ishar games, combat in this game is turn-based, and takes place on separate screens. The players must manually navigate party members on the battle field. Archers and spellcasters can use ranged attacks, while melee fighters must stand close to the enemy in order to strike.</desc>

		<name>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons - Curse of the Azure Bonds</name>
		<desc>Outside of the town of Tilverton, the party of heroes has been ambushed, captured and cursed with five azure markings called "bonds". These bonds have dangerous magical powers that can take control of the heroes at the most inopportune times. They must now search for the source of the bonds, and free themselves from the curse.

The second in the  Gold Box series of role-playing games, Curse of the Azure Bonds is a sequel to  Pool of Radiance. The gameplay is nearly identical to that of the predecessor and other Gold Box games. Following the  AD&amp;D rules of role-playing, the player creates a party of characters (up to the maximum of six). Two new character classes (Paladin and Ranger) are added to the four basic AD&amp;D classes Fighter, Thief, Mage, and Cleric, which were available in Pool of Radiance. Exploration takes place in pseudo-3D environments, from first-person view. Battles (random as well as pre-set) take the player-controlled and enemy party to a top-down battle screen. Commands are issued in turn-based fashion, and the player-controlled characters can freely navigate the battle field. There is also an overview "world map" that allows instant traveling between cities.</desc>

There are three tombs, each of them are extensive environments which scroll in multiple directions. The player uses a jet pack for movement and searches for the pods which the parasites are using to extract the energy. They have to be brought to a special room to destroy them there. The goal is to get rid of all pods in a level, but the parasites have something against this. And so they actively try to kill the protagonist, but fortunately he has ten weapon systems at his disposal to shoot back. Well, at least if he bought them from special silos with earned points. The total energy reserves of the tomb act as time limit.</desc>

		<name>Cyberball</name>
		<desc>After American Football players started cheating by using bionic parts, the game was forced to change its rules. By 2022, the game was played not by humans, but two teams of seven robots. To spice things up, the usual pig skin ball was replaced with a 350 pound bomb.

Cyberball brings this fast and furious action to life. Gameplay is essentially the same as the real sport, although the 'downs' are replaced by the bomb's heat gradually increasing towards 'critical'. After this it will explode and possession will be swapped. This is prevented when you cross the 50-yard line, lose possession or score a touchdown, in which cases it resets to 'cool'. Field goals and punts are not featured - the only kick is the initial kick-off you receive.

Control passes from the quarterback (thrower) to the intended catcher as soon as a pass is released. The two-player game is co-operative - on offense one player passes and the other receives.</desc>

The game is similar to Gaunlet, and levels must be completed within a time limit which changes based on level complexity. In order to complete levels, the player has to locate and collect the five crystals and then find and use the exit. Walls, enemies, and other obstacles will impede the player throughout the game and players much maintain a supply of energy units or their game will come to an end. Players can select between two characters at the start of each level. The two characters have different qualities and limitations which make them more or less adept to each different level.</desc>

Since this is a fighting game, the object obviously is to smash the other guy. You can either beat him with your weapon until he has lost all of his energy, or you can make it short by separating his head from the body (A Swedish shave).

Decent graphics, much better than in many commercial releases, but unfortunately animation is weak and control over the fighters is horrible. You can get used to it, but after some time it becomes tiresome. Nevertheless, if the game was a bit polished, it could have been quite good.</desc>

		<name>Cybernetix - The First Battle</name>
		<desc>Cybernetix: The First Battle is a Shoot 'Em Up game, developed by Vision and published by Amiga Format, which was released in Europe in 1992.



It can happen! And it has! Finally, a PD game - all right, shareware, but still darned cheap - that l can wholeheartedly say is better than a lot of the commercial stuff that's available. New Zealand-written slice of freely distributable software. My life has meaning once more!



So, why is Cybernetix so good? Well, it certainly isn't originality. It s basically Defender meets Asteroids on steroids. A sideways-scrolling blast-'em-up where you have to obliterate everything in each section which comes complete with a variety of power-ups, bonus lives every 10.000 points and a smart bomb. But there are three main reasons why it shines. It looks stunning, it plays like a dream and it's fast. Faster, in fact, than a very fast thing.



The graphics are pure quality. The asteroids really look 3D while the substantial-looking ships explode into shrapnel, and some even start spouting smoke and spiraling out of control when they are first hit and need to be hit again. The controls are very responsive, which they need to be at the speeds this game reaches. The radar is also very clear and you need to keep one eye on it to see where the alien ships are when they're off the main screen.



There are tons of sectors to clear, some with special missions, and a two-player option. Oh yes, and the sound is also superb.



VERDICT: The concept might not be all that original, but the game has so much style, action and playability, who cares? Do yourself a favour, and get It now and remind yourself what good old blasting is all about.</desc>

		<desc>The follow-up to Cybernoid: The Fighting Machine is again a flip-screen shoot 'em up. In control of the deadly Cybernoid craft, your job is to rescue the cargo which has been stolen by a wave of pirate ships.

Using the range of weapon systems correctly is again a key factor. These include sideways aiming guns, bouncing bombs, 'seeker' smart bombs, bombs which move around th edge of the screen before finding a target, and time-sensitive bombs which explode a few seconds after you drop them. Shot pirate ships release cargo, and you must collect at least 1500 points of this, but on many screens it is more prudent to make an escape ASAP, as some screens have more hazards than others, and not all aliens on each screen act in the same way.

Cheats :

Now you have to fly an experimental spacefighter, the Cybernoid, into battle to recover the asteroids. The Cybernoid is equipped with standard laser blasters, missiles, and the ability to pick up other weapons along the way. 



Cybernoid is an arcade style action game for one player. You can choose from three different skill levels; easy, hard and lethal. On some versions two different sound modes are also available, a basic music and sound effects mode, and a super sound effects mode with no music. Each room you explore is equipped with a time bomb. The bomb will explode taking you with it should you take too long to get past all the obstacles on the screen.

		<desc>Join the ranks of the elite and take control of a crack team... The 501st Cyber Assault Squad. The foreign legion of the future; armed to the teeth with high-tech weapons and wearing power assisted armour, only these rock hard commandos are tough enough to take on the universe - and beyond...

Lead Raa, Gee, and Bee into battle against terrifying alien life forms, on missions that are more than just another bug-hunt. Time is running out... The drop-ship is ready to roll; and you are about to board an express elevator to hell... Going down!

You are given five missions to complete, each mission has four decks. You can use teleport pads to warp to another area of the deck. If you don't complete your mission under the given time limit, you'll fail your mission and the game ends, and stopping you from completing your mission are a horde of aliens. Some areas are guarded by a steel door, and the only way that you can open it, is by obtaining a red, green, blue, yellow, or black ID card. As well as the doors, there are force field gates, which can be deactivated if someone in your team carries a force field key. At the end of each mission is a boss waiting to terminate you on sight.

Raa, Gee, and Bee can carry up to six items in their inventory. The first two places are reserved for weapons. The four remaining places can be filled with ID cards, disks, smart bomb units, and shields. If one of the team members already have six items and they pick a seventh item up, then that item replaces the active inventory item (which is shown by a white border around it).

During your mission, you can access terminals which require a red, green, blue, or yellow disk which can be found either lying about, or it is dropped by an alien. These terminals allow you to bypass door circuits, view deck blueprints, and scan restricted information. The blueprints are useful if you can't find your way around a deck. Also with these terminals, you can obtain several items like force field key circuits, party shield orbs, time distortion cubes, and much more.

In between each mission, you are given a passkey, which you can enter at the title screen. This passkey lets you start a new mission later. If you haven't discovered the cheats earlier, they will be revealed when you complete the game.</desc>

		<name>Cyberzerk</name>
		<desc>Cyberzerk is a top-down shooter in which the player has to cleanse a big space ship from all inhabitants. This is accomplished by using either the standard gun or a limited supply of grenades. The ship consists of various levels which in itself are divided into non-scrolling rooms which are navigated by using one of the exits of the current screen. The death of every enemy - which mostly move on a set path without actively hunting the player - within a time limit is the requirement for finishing a level.

Getting hit by an enemy causes the life energy to go down and running out results in an instant game over. To counter this, energy refreshments are sometimes left behind by killed enemies. Other extras are grenades and a map which shows the layout of the current level but can be used only once. The co-operative two-player mode features friendly fire.</desc>

The player can enter single races (always including qualifying) or complete in a full season. The action is viewed from the handlebars of your bike, a novelty for motorcycle racing at the time. The game engine is similar to that used by Grand Prix Circuit, but now incorporates hills.</desc>

The character control is skittish, meaning that the droid is hard to stop instantly, which makes progression through the levels harder. One unusual feature is that the droid can be split into town components, Cyt and Ron, in a manner similar to Head Over Heels. This comes in useful when switches must be activated in a part of the level away from the force-field they unlock, as Cyt can be sent to flick the switch so that Ron can progress through the level as soon as it is flicked.</desc>

		<desc>The third licensed game based around the legendary British decathlete did something slightly wider in scope than the basic Games style of play. Before you play the main events you have to train in the gym. Weight-lifting, squats and sit-ups are included, which involve waggling the joystick as fast as you can to fill a displayed bottle of Lucozade (clever bit of product-placement there). The better you do at this, the better you'll fare in the events, which are predominantly waggling-based as well. They include the standard decathlon events of running, jumping and throwing as well as you can. There are four types of shoes available, and choosing the wrong one for the event will seriously hamper your performance.</desc>

You take control of Michael Modelcitizen and start the game with only a simple baseball bat inside his flat. Once outside you can walk around the huge city killing people (including old ladies and children), stealing better weapons and narcotics. By using different narcotics it is possible to enhance the strength of Michael?s body.

Watch out for the police and the military, they will try to stop you and don?t expect your baseball bat to make any impact on their equipment. If you are good enough maybe you will make it to the atom bomb in the end.</desc>

It is your job to prevent this. In the maddeningly short time frame, you will have to explore the galaxy (which contains 9 planets and 19 moons) and try to find a way to stop the comet.

Just like Mercenary, you play this game in the first person perspective, this time however with detailed filled polygon graphics. You can walk on the planets, drive vehicles and fly spaceships. It is very non-linear, you can go to any planet and any moon at any time and do whatever you like. You'll have to find and use objects and examine buildings and places... and stay away from Eris if you can't destroy Damocles in time!</desc>

		<desc>In Dan Dare III, Virgin's latest addition to the saga, Dan faces his toughest challenge yet. The Mekon has made things pretty rough for him. Dare has been taken prisoner and moved to a satellite from where the Mekon intends to sublimate the entire race of the Earth thanks to his armies of Treens Ã¢â‚¬â€œ products of his unsuccessful Treenisation experiments.

But Dan quickly escapes and finds a spaceship which should get him back to Earth. But before he can make it work, he must locate 50lbs of fuel in a catacomb of corridors, chambers and shafts.

Dan is initially armed with a plasma rifle, a single power shield and handy jet pack. If he can fight his way to the stores computer on the first level he can order from a plethora of weapons stock as long as his credit holds out including extra lives, nuke bombs, homing missiles. But all cost. Once Dan is armed, he selects each weapon by pulling down on the joystick, the current selection being shown by its particular icon.

The icons are clear and obvious, contrasting sharply with the small graphics of the characters and selection of each icon takes place during play so an element of real time swapping is inherent. While the music is pleasant yet unmemorable and sound effects are too limited, the scrolling most certainly is poor. It jerky and slow.

Probe Software, who are responsible for the game, have a better reputation for graphics then this especially after having made such a good job on the Spectrum, Dan Dare on the Amiga is therefore an enigma Ã¢â‚¬â€œ jerky scrolling coupled with reasonable graphics and underused sound make for a game which will be forgotten easily, unless you buy it in which case it will be remembered for its mediocrity.</desc>

		<path>./Darius+_v1.0.lha</path>
		<name>Darius +</name>
		<desc>Darius was Taito's effort to compete in the arcades against the likes of R-Type and Gradius. Technically impressive, it featured three screens depicting the largest playfield seen in a game so far (the same system was employed for Ninja Warriors), with the player sitting atop a big set of loudspeakers. Visually and audibly, it was a league above Irem's and Konami's offerings.

When Taito (and others) ported the game to home machines, they were forced to shrink the playfield to fit in one single screen, and re-dubbed it Darius Plus.

The plot of Darius involves the two heroes Proco Jr. and Tiat Young fighting the menaces posed by galactic fish and other sea animals again their homeworld.

What sets Darius apart from other shoot'em-ups of the time is its way of letting the player choose his path with a certain amount of freedom. At the end of each area (level), you are able to choose between one of two worlds which the area branches into. This renders a higher replay value, since there are many paths to reach the end of the game by.
Apart from this, the gameplay is on the simplistic side, both due to unimaginative attack waves and little interaction with the surroundings, but mainly due to the very basic powerup system, which is nowhere near the complexity of the aforementioned R-Type's and Gradius'.</desc>

		<desc>Darkman was developed by Ocean Software and published by Ocean Software in 1991. 

In this side-scrolling platformer, the player controls Darkman, a superhero who can jump, kick and punch, as well as swing from a rope during action sequences between levels. In each level, Darkman disguises himself as the boss of the level, whom he must defeat before the time limit elapses. Tying into the plot of the film, Darkman wears masks of various gangsters who are responsible for his disfigurement, but his disguise dissolves after being exposed to sunlight for too long. The character changes into a different member of the evil gang in each level, taking on their attack moves as well as their face.

In-between levels, Darkman must photograph his quarry before he can make a mask of them. These scenes involve moving the cursor to take a picture of the gangster. The better the photo accuracy, the more time Darkman is granted to complete the subsequent level. The final level is the most faithful to the film, and takes place on a skyscraper under construction.</desc>

Core Design went on to publish a less-well received pseudo-sequel to Darkmere in 1994 called Dragonstone, on Amiga and Amiga CD32.

Darkmere is an adventure game set in a fantasy universe, with much reference to Tolkien's. You play Ebryn, son of Gildorn. Your father, too old himself to go on such an adventure, sends you to investigate the evil curse that is plaguing your land. The game introduction starts as Ebryn gets teleported in town, and while he slowly materializes, a mighty creepy description sets the atmosphere. Creatures are roaming the abandoned streets, and as the chilly wind bites at you, you can hear the screams of their victims in the distance.</desc>

		<desc>Dark Seed is an adventure game which capitalizes on the drawings of famous horror designer H. R. Giger as a source of background artwork and inspiration.

You play Mike Dawson, an ad company manager who, in pursuit of his goal in life to become a writer, purchases a solitary mansion in a small town called Woodland Hills. Although the low cost and hush-hush transactions when purchasing the house do raise your suspicion, the solitary environment and sheer beauty of the house crush common sense and you decide to buy the house. That's when trouble begin. Upon reaching the house, you suddenly feel tired. You find a bed and fall asleep...

... and wake up from a terrible dream, only to find out that your life has just become a worse nightmare: an unknown source has implanted a seed of darkness in your mind, and you only have three days to find a way to stop it.</desc>

		<name>Dark Side</name>
		<desc>In Driller, the Ketars attempted to blow up the moon Mitral, but you stopped them. Now, they have Energy Collection Devices collectively known as EGOs, and hope to stock them up to use towards the Zephyr One device, and direct its energy at the planet Evath, resulting in a catastrophic radiation overload. 

Your mission is to beam onto their base on the moon Tricuspid, and destroy the EGOs. Destroying one will buy you more of your limited time. The problem is, many are connected to at least 2 others, and those can immediately regenerate, so you must tackle them in an order in which those with only 1 connection are attacked first.

You are inside a space suit, propelled by a Jet Pack with limited fuel, and possess lasers and a shield. Shield energy is limited, but can be recharged through pentagons and rods. In a world viewed through the the Freescape 3D system, you roam the verdant planet of trees, buildings and underground tunnels.

Gameplay has more action than Driller. The Freescape world has a third dimension - due to the jetpack you can leave the ground and look down on the view. You can also rotate the angle and make quick U-turns. You must leave the ground to shoot the active part of an ECD, but the jetpack uses energy at a faster rate, so use this feature sparingly. You must avoid Plexors, which weaken your shield, and deflector devices, which can beam you into prison.</desc>

		<desc>The Gods of War, Intelligence, and Magic have created DarkSpyre, and intimidating tower full of riddles and monsters. The player takes control of an aspiring champion, whose goal is to explore the maze-like levels of the tower, retrieve five powerful runes hidden there, and ultimately save the world from destruction. 

DarkSpyre a top-down "dungeon-crawling" role-playing game. The player creates the protagonist, choosing gender and magic specialization (healing or offensive), as well as customizing his/her combat parameters. The game consists of navigating the tower's complex levels (39 of them must be traversed to complete the game, though there are 50 altogether), fighting monsters in action-based combat. The protagonist can equip a variety of weapons and armor; weapons can break after excessive usage, and armor will deteriorate in quality if worn for a long time. Spells are learned from scrolls found in the tower. The hero gains weapon and magic proficiency by repeatedly using the same weapon and/or spell.</desc>

		<path>./DasBoot_v1.0.lha</path>
		<name>Boot, Das</name>
		<desc>Based on the classic German film of the same name this is a submarine simulation set during WW2. Despite being made in 1990 and therefore primarily designed for the A500 I was surprised to find that the game not only detects and makes use of faster (020+) processors but also promotes to run on VGA monitors.

Control is via the mouse and keyboard and as with all such games there are many keys to learn if you want to become proficient in the game. That said the game is quite accessible without a deep knowledge of these keys. The game menu offers 8 training modes; 4 above and 4 below the surface.

The 6 included scenarios follow the film plot and range from the fjord patrol through operations in the North Atlantic to Gibraltar and the Mediterranean. Difficulty levels are available with the selection of such parameters as torpedo reliability, spares availability and repair states.

On the down side the game suffers from the same problem that inflicts all sub sims, namely lack of action. However, since this is a generic problem and not just akin to this game it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it any worse than itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s peers.

As a game, whilst it wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t become a member of my "top tier" it certainly has earned a place on my hard drive and the right to remain there. This is a game which has changed my views on sub sims due to its playability and nice graphics. So if like me youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve tried sub sims before but never really liked them, try this game out  If you give it a chance it may just change your opinion of the genre too.</desc>

		<name>Datastorm</name>
		<desc>The Defender gameplay was the basis for this shoot 'em up, with a horizontally-scrolling landscape which eventually loops back on itself. Your basic task is to pick up each of the 8 pods in turn, and carry them through a portal elsewhere in the level, before going back for another one. 

There are power-ups available, representing an auto-fire (Surely one of the earliest software implementations of this), extra simultaneous lasers, missiles to home in on the Landers as they attack, a level-skip, and a Super Shield.

As standard in Defender games, Lander craft are also there to pick up the pods, and these must be stopped before reaching the top of the screen, as both the Lander and Pod become fearsome enemies if they do. If you shoot the Lander, the pod drops back to the ground, for you to retrieve. Unusually, you don't have to wait for the Lander to attack before picking up a pod. 

You must shoot all enemies to progress to the next level, at which point you get a bonus for the number of remaining pods. Every four levels the pods are replenished, which means that losing them on the first of each set of 4 levels (1,5,9,13 etc.) reduces your next four bonuses. If you don't save at least one pod on each level, your will have to face tougher enemies, and without your shield being replenished.</desc>

		<desc>Nil Dieu Vivant (also known as Day of the Pharaoh) is an action-oriented strategy game set in ancient Egypt.

You start as descendant of the Pharaoh who was exiled from his kingdom. Your mission is to return to Cairo and claim the throne that is your birthright. You have to prove your worth to the people of Egypt by conquering neighboring lands and defending your kingdom from attack.

You can make offerings to various Egyptian gods in hopes of divine aid, marry a bride to ensure that your line will continue if you fall in battle, wage wars with neighboring countries, and so on. To construct the various buildings, you will need to find different types. Your starting city will not have all the raw materials available, so you will be forced to conquer your neighbors early on.

Combat takes place action-style. You will ride in a royal chariot, shooting arrows at the invaders who will throw lances at you. Divine favors, when they are granted, can result in complete annihilation of your enemies, but those are very rare and depend mostly on luck.</desc>

As Cole Trickle you're in the race for the Stock Car Championship Trophy against 20 other Stock Car drivers. Before each race a qualification round determines your position on the grid for the race.

Finish a race with a fast enough lap speed and it's onto the next circuit. Cole's sponsor, Harry Hogge, sends through telegrams judging your performance throughout the Championship. The Amiga version has external viewpoints including Sky Cam and trackside views along with options to define the number cars (from 5 to 20) and laps (a minimum of 10), parade lap length and level of detail. A Player vs Player modem facility is also offered. For the race itself, the Amiga version has a first-person perspective.</desc>

		<name>D-Day</name>
		<desc>This multi-genre game represents famous historical events of World War II called D-Day and related to operation "Overlord", when Allies attack Axis massively in France.

The game proposes to be a general in command of Allies group and optionally perform certain actions by yourself also. Such actions include:
1. Piloting a plane over French territory to bomb strategically important places; 
2. Landing on hostile territory as paratrooper; 
3. Breaking through enemy lines as infantry soldier; 
4. Driving a tank and fighting as a tank team with enemies in French village.

All kinds of gameplay differ in looks from 1st or 3rd person perspective in simulator-like missions (tank and plane respectively) to isometric (infantry) and platform (paratrooper) with corresponding actions made in all of them. All such military actions may be played as single missions or combined and also strategically managed on the map during a real-time approach in Overlord campaign. The game progress may be saved to be restored later.

Multiple options allow to turn off participation in certain or all military actions as well as adjust enemy actions including even such event as 'Hitler does not wake up'.</desc>

		<name>Death Bringer</name>
		<desc>The Unique Selling Point of Deathbringer is the amazing parallax scrolling Ã¢â‚¬â€œ each of the 36 lines of the background scrolls individually, making for the closest thing to a real-life effect yet seen. It's very impressive indeed, but it would seem it didn't leave much memory space for gameplay, because Deathbringer is so thin in that department it makes Barbarian II looks like, I don't know, Sim Earth.

In most of these horizontally-scrolling beat-'em-ups, gameplay is a simple matter of walking for a bit, coming up against a bad guy, fighting to the death with him, walking on a bit more etc. Deathbringer boldly does away with the 'fighting' bit, allowing you to quite happily walk right through any of the enemies who block your way, meaning that you only have to kill the occasional one in order to keep your sword (which lusts for blood and will kill you if it isn't 'fed' regularly) happy. Now and again there are big end-of-level-type baddies to kill or simplistic dodging sequences, but otherwise that's yer lot.</desc>

Like Champions of Krynn, Death Knights of Krynn introduces a different and unique character selection with the availability of the "Knight" class, unavailable in AD&amp;D non-Dragonlance RPGs. Characters in this game may level-up to higher levels and obtain new skills as well as more powerful spells. Experienced Knights may ultimately choose one out of 3 "clans" to focus more on a different type of fighting style.</desc>

		<name>Death Mask</name>
		<desc>Doom on the 7Mhz, 16-colour, 1Mb Amiga 500 might sound unrealistic, but this is one of a handful of games that managed it, and the first full Doom-style game for the Amiga.

Unusually the multiplayer game was split-screen, which didn't really work because you could sneak a look into the other window to see where your opponent was - it's not exactly full of suspense.

The major compromises in getting the game onto the A500 are the graphics, which lack texture-mapping, and the trick-3D used where the characters don't rotate smoothly in 360 degrees, but jerk through a small range of viewpoints, a la Dungeon Master. Only half the screen is used for the actual motion as well, with the rest reserved for RPG-style artwork - which is obviously superfluous because the 2-player game doesn't have it. It's a throwback to the first Lotus game of all things. You can even turn the animation off.

In one-player mode there are 34 levels, accessed via passwords, 3 lives, and lots of powerup weapons. If one player completes the level, both advance to the next one (like Lotus 2, funnily enough. I guess I ought to think of a similarity to Lotus 3, just to complete the set). There's also the standard Death Match mode.</desc>

The trap has been set up by the magician king Shankriya and has been existing for five centuries. It's the players job to make things right again. The game has a wide variety of enemies from ghosts to fireball throwing magicians. Defeating some enemies gives the player the player a flask with some liquid that can be converted into spells and such.</desc>

		<desc>A planet sits on the verge of environmental disaster. It's the player's job to find the sources and shut them down, but the slightest intervention can have ramifications on a worldwide scale.

Début features a fusion of both traditional arcade side-scroller action and a complex planet simulation. The arcade sections feature multiple levels as the player descends deeper into the planet's infrastructure, shutting down reactors, halting pollution, and eliminating bad guys.

The simulation part of this game presents a 3D satellite view of the planet, allowing the player to scan various attributes of the ecosystem below. Both elements combine to present the player with two separate and complimentary goals that need to be fulfilled - both careful monitoring and influence of the planet, together with direct hands-on intervention.

As an added bonus, there is a sound generator called "Vibes" included that allows various loopback and reverb effects to be applied to the game's soundtrack.</desc>

		<desc>The Psygnosis team has come a long way since their first Amiga title (the underwhelming Brataccas); Deep Space is my favorite of the new crop. The whole package is a treat, from the delightfully raunchy comic-book in the box to the ultra techno-funky controls and the humorous enemy spacecraft that look like hi-thrust box Kites. You play the part of Strix, the owl-headed galactic sociopath bounty hunter, scouring the galaxy causing, as much mayhem as possible (especially for Mirfaks) and making your fortune any way you can. First-rate, in itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time.</desc>

		<desc>In The Deep the player takes the role of a ship which has to defend itself against a variety of underwater enemies, e.g. u-boats or jellyfish with weapons. All the enemies launch missiles or mines at the boat which can be dodged by moving left or right. Water bombs can be dropped to get rid of the enemies - but there are only eight available which slowly refill over time.

Sometimes a helicopter drops crates which include useful extras like smart bombs, steering rockets or additional speed. The ship can also turn into a submarine to collect things under the water. Every screen has a different objective, e.g. collecting an orb, bombing an underwater station or destroying a powerful ship.</desc>

		<name>Defender of the Crown</name>
		<desc>Defender of the Crown puts the player in the role of one of four Saxon knights in medieval England, in a time where the land is in turmoil as the King is dead and his crown was stolen. The Saxons and the Normans blame each other and fight for control of England.

After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, the game starts with a single castle and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight and defeat the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.

In addition to the basic 'build your army and conquer your opponents' the game offers several events and options that can be used to fine tune your play style: You may  engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse, gaining either fame or land, or you can go raid a castle for loot or the hand of a princess, joining your houses and territories.</desc>

		<desc>There's plenty of reflection in this game, in both senses of the word. That's because this strategic puzzler involves using mirrors to direct a beam of light across a succession of 60 screens. Each mirror has 16 different angles it can be set at, each of which will send the beam around the screen in different ways.

Before the exit is activated, all the mines on a screen must be cleared by running the beam over them. There are other devices built into the levels, including teleports and random angle-changers, as well as hazards to avoid (they cause the beam to overheat) and droids which go around moving the mirrors' directions.</desc>

		<name>Déjà Vu II : Lost in Las Vegas</name>
		<desc>Deja Vu II: Lost in Las Vegas is a point-and-click adventure game, the sequel to Deja Vu: a Nightmare Comes True!!, set in the world of 1940s hard-boiled detective novels and movies.

When the original Deja Vu was first released on the Macintosh its software technology caused quite a sensation. Two more games in the same format followed, Shadowgate and Uninvited, and now a sequel to the original has arrived.
Deja Vu II uses the full windowing capabilities of the Amiga, and play is almost 100% by mouse. Word icons are used to enter command verbs, and the picture and/or a graphical representation of a carried object is used to complete the command. Click on EXAMINE, and then click on an object in the picture, and a description of it is displayed in the text window. More common verbs like TAKE or DROP are executed by simply dragging the required object from picture into an INVENTORY window and vice versa.

If that is not enough, there is extensive animation within the picture. But, disappointingly, on the Amiga there is no sound Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the digitised sound of a railway station, with steam trains arriving and porters shouting Ã¢â‚¬ËœAll aboard!Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ is sadly absent in comparison with the Atari ST version. The Amiga picture, too, when using a TV, is of poorer quality than that on the ST, and the window titles are very indistinct.

Deja Vu II is a worthwhile but not an easy game. How can you get past the morgue attendant, for example? To what use can you put the hidden secrets you uncover in JoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bar? Attention to detail and perseverance are needed to progress through the story, but will prove rewarding and result in an entertaining and enjoyable adventure.</desc>

		<name>Déjà Vu : A Nightmare Comes True!</name>
		<desc>Deja Vu: A Nightmare Comes True!! is an Adventure game, developed by Pacesetter Laboratories and published by Mindscape, which was released in 1986.

Deja vu is a most unusual adventure, driven almost exclusively by joystick. Nevertheless, it is a text adventure, not an arcade adventure! Let me explain.
The screen consists of three main windows. The graphics window shows a pictorial representation of the current location. A window below it conveys the text narrative, plus any messages in response to commands like EXAMINE. The inventory window, to the right, is used to deposit objects shown in the graphics window that have been TAKEN. Above these windows is a collection of verb boxes, and below the inventory window is an exits window.

The plot is that of a mystery thriller. Finding yourself in the toilet cubicle of JoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Bar after closing time, you have suffered a total loss of memory. Locked doors prevent you from escaping, and soon you stumble upon a corpse in an upstairs office. His face is vaguely familiar, but you cannot quite place him. Are you being framed for the murder Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or did you actually commit it? You do no know, and you cannot remember.

For something different, Deja vu is worth trying, and in any event, makes a worthwhile adventure</desc>

This isn't as easy as it sounds, because this scrolling platform shooter has many sections in which the fairies are falling towards fiery pits, and you must catch them without hitting this pit.

The controls allow you to jump, and then jump again while falling, so you can, with effort, climb most of the way up the screen. The forces of the Black Queen are out to stop you, including spiders, bats and goblins, and even the clouds and stalactites on the ceilings launch deadly droplets of distilled doom. A bonus level is offered sporadically, allowing you to collect coins for extra lives - although you start with 9, you'll need them, as the levels are long and treacherous.</desc>

		<name>Deluxe Galaga</name>
		<desc>Edgar M. Vigdal: "Deluxe Galaga is based on the game StarBattle on the old VIC20. That was one excellent game, that I had a lot of fun with. It's also some features from the games Galaga and Galaxions. I played Galaga on an arcade machine, but it was so long ago that I have forgotten how it looked like. My version of Galaga (or StarBattle) is a simple shoot'em up game with good game play, but not so much fancy graphics. Many of today games have lots and lots of graphics, but when it comes to game play they really sucks. They have manuals covering hundreds of pages, and you need hours and days to get into the game.  What I want from a game is some relaxation for a couple of minutes, and then be able to quit the game and do some more work. And not to mark the calendar for when I want to play the 60MB hi-tech game!

You are in control of a small starfighter, and your mission is to protect the earth from alien attackers. When you start, your ship have limited supply of bullets and are moving a bit to slow, but by shooting the aliens you can collect the falling bonuses and get all sorts of weapons, extra speed and a lot of other goodies! When you are hit, some of the weapon power is lost and also speed and any bonus time you have collected. This loss is bigger on the hard level. There are double shoot, triple shoot, super weapon, extra life, smart bombs, money, warps, secret bonus level and much more to be collected and added to the starfighter. Look out for mother ships, rockets, warp malfunctions, super guardians and Super Cash Ship! There is also a lot of secrets in the game, you can find this secrets yourself, or you can buy them in space-shop. The space-shop will appear every fourth level, but you must have more than 50 credits to enter the shop. There are more than 10 secrets hidden in the game and some that are not listed in the game!

The Sub Games: 
Meteor Storm: You must navigate you ship through a field of big rocks floating in space. Some of the rocks have bonus point on surface and can be collected. There are also some money containers floating around. Collect these and get some extra shopping money.  You will get a super bonus if you complete the meteor storm.
The Memory Station:  Try and find a pair (Two blocks that look the same) in a matrix of blocks. If you find a pair you will get the bonus that are one the blocks. You only have limited time to find as many pairs as possible. If you find all the pairs you will get a bonus.

		<name>Deluxe Pac-man</name>
		<desc>Edgar M. Vigdal said: This is my personal version of the old, but still wonderful game PacMan (or maybe Jelly Monster). It's not a copy of the original because I have never played the arcade machine. This  game was written after some good memories of the game 'Jelly  Monster' on the VIC-20. This game was one of the first games  I had on the old 3.5KB computer, and my brother and I were
 fighting like mad to beat each others high score. The heart pounded, the adrenaline was flowing in great amounts, and the  fingers shivered.

The game is like this. Our yellow hero Pacman must eat all  of the pills in the maze to get to the next maze. But danger  lurks in the maze. Four evil ghosts are looking for Pacman,  and they want to stop Pacman from getting to the next maze.  In the maze there are some power pills that Pacman can eat,  and he can then kill the ghosts for a limited time. There are  also some fruits that popup from time to time, and Pacman can  eat these for extra bonus points. And sometimes some special  tools will appear which, when eaten, may affect Pacman or the  pills or even the ghosts. Some will speed up Pacman, some  will give random points and some will lead to extra levels.

I hope you have got the plot by now because it's really simple - just survive in the maze as long as possible and get  the highest score.</desc>

The parser is on par with the one developed by Infocom. It supports chain commands and adverb recognition, and goes beyond by adding support of mouse input and interface customization. These features are enabled on a menu that pops up when right-clicking on the screen.

The optional verb menu allows complete sentence construction with the mouse. The interface can be changed to several different ways of displaying text, from a Zorkish traditional full screen output to a scrolling window.</desc>

By using different narcotics it is possible to enhance the strength of Michael’s body.

Watch out for the police and the military, they will try to stop you and don’t expect your baseball bat to make any impact on their equipment. If you are good enough maybe you will make it to the atom bomb in the end.</desc>

		<desc>This game brings the US cartoon character Dennis the Menace's menacing treatment of poor old Mr. Wilson to the computer screen, around the time of the film also released in 1993. 

Dennis is a platform game across settings such as Sewers, the Park, and Mr. Wilson’s house, each of which has an end-of-level bad guy. The in-level opposition follows standard attack patterns and can usually be avoided. The enemies regenerate as you move on, although you generally only progress from bottom-left to top-right anyway. 

Some of the holes in the ground are deadly while others lead to secret rooms. Fortunately, you are given up to 9 lives at the start, and lots of extra lives are on offer throughout the game, so these are well worth checking out. A choice between music and sound effects is offered.</desc>

		<desc>Detonator is a Breakout variant with 50 levels. The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the screen which can be moved left and right and is used to bounce a ball into the playfield (respectively keep it from falling down).

The goal is to clear the field of all destroyable blocks in it which is accomplished when the ball hits them. Some blocks have to be touched multiple times before they break (this in indicated by changing colours) and others leave behind extras which float towards the bottom and have to picked up to activate them. Examples include a bigger paddle, a laser, multiple balls at the same time or the computer taking control over the paddle for a short time.</desc>

		<desc>Detroit puts you in the year 1908, and you are the President of an upstart car company. You will build and design cutting-edge automobiles, take care of finances and promote your products with marketing campaigns. Vintage car lovers will really enjoy the game, as it includes many classic car designs, all of which you can modify to your heart's content. As time goes by, new technologies will become available, and the industry will evolve with faster and safer cars. Competition, of course, will become tougher as your competitors catch up to your technological advantages.
You must then think globally -- open new factories overseas, and think of how to segment your market with different car models that do not cannibalize each other's sales.</desc>

		<name>Deuteros - The Next Millennium</name>
		<desc>Deuteros: The Next Millennium is the sequel to the sci-fi strategy video game Millennium 2.2, published by Activision for the Amiga and Atari ST.

While the game shares themes of space exploration and resource gathering - plus some elements of its interface - with its predecessor, the two are different in gameplay.

The object of Deuteros is to mine and manage resources, explore the Solar System and beyond. For this, 3 categories of civilians are trained: Producers, Researchers and Marines, out of a pool of 6000 population. The longer these teams are used, they are advanced in three levels, required for some later action (some inventions can be manufactured only by a producer who is at "Expert" level while Pilots with the rank of "Admiral" will be more effective in battles).

New bases built on other planets must be manned with new teams of Producers in order to construct the shuttles and derricks needed for supply. Some of these events are "milestones" which will trigger new technology to be researched by the scientists.

The player has to take care mostly of the transaction between the planets and the factories and distribute their supply with shuttles and long-range spacecraft. New technology (such as automatisation computers or teleport) will replace some of the player's involvement, as the player must later concentrate on war.</desc>

		<desc>A scientist obsessed with Picasso's cubist paintings develops a weapon that turns everything to cubes. The United Kingdom sends a secret agent to revert the affected objects and monuments back to their original state.

Devious Designs is a puzzle game where geometric shapes have to be assembled. The player controls a 007-style secret agent that has the ability to walk on the walls, lift heavy objects and shoot. Using these, he must drag and drop the geometric pieces scattered on the screen (by standing next to them and holding the fire button) on translucent slots. Each level is a screen with a timer on the top. When the counter runs out, the level is reset and the player looses one life. Like in Bubble Bobble, various objects fall from the screen that can be collected for points, along with more useful power-ups like explosives, extra-time, extra-lives and a special block than fills a slot (it can be shot if it's not needed). Also, if the player takes too long to solve the level a random enemy appears, but it can be killed by the agent's gun.

The game starts with 6 lives and has a password system.</desc>

		<name>Die Hard 2 - Die Harder</name>
		<desc>Die Hard 2: Die Harder is a Shooter game, developed by Tiertex Ltd and published by Grandslam Video Ltd, which was released in Europe in 1990.

In the early 90Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s, two things just wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t die: Bruce Willis in the Die Hard trilogy of movies, and, well, 2D point-and-click shooters. Renowned software undertaker Grandslam was happily ready to dig the grave several inches deeper for both. The spade: a game called Die Hard 2: Die Harder.

Based on the 1990 movie Die Hard 2, the program sends you through five stages modeled after key scenes of the film. As N.Y. cop John McClane, you have to shoot terrorists invading WashingtonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Dulles airport by quickly aiming a crosshair at them. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll successively clear the luggage center, airport annexe and runway, then chase after the bad guys on a snowmobile and finally shoot it out on the wing of the terroristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s plane. Each stage consists of three screens; on the last one, several tougher bosses will appear. Occasionally, civilians cross the room and pray that you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t kill them. Most dying terrorists drop power-ups, namely med-kits, armor, grenades and weapons that are more powerful or fire faster. You collect these items by shooting them in time. If you do not aim fast enough, the terroristÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bullets will drain your health; you may die three times, but after that, John McClane bites the dust once and for all. Until you restart, that is.</desc>

		<desc>Diggers is a Lemmings-style puzzle game where you command five alien miners ( from a choice of four clans ) and various gadgets to dig for treasure. The game is divided in excavation areas. Each area has a set amount of money you must raise before moving into the next one. To do so, you must sell your collected treasure to the bank.

You select your "Diggers" by clicking on them with the left mouse button, and making them do a desired action by right-clicking on the screen and choosing from a icon menu.

Each clan has different characteristics and stats: for example the Grablins clan resembles fantasy dwarfs and has the fastest diggers. The Quarriors clan has the strongest miners, less likely to die in a fight with enemy diggers.</desc>

		<desc>Discovery: In The Steps Of Columbus is a Strategy game, developed by Golden Sector and published by Impressions Games, which was released in Europe in 1992.

Following in the steps of Columbus? Well he didn't walk across the Atlantic did he? This game places you as a European power trying to rip off the New World as economically as possible. You go broke, game over. Quite an innovative theme.

You have four opponents who make life tough, and there's five extra scenarios for those who want to discover real new worlds. Cutesie but blocky graphics of settlements, soldiers and ships help add life to what is a management game. The map is just a wall of fog at the beginning of the game. Sending out ships to found colonies (preferably with lots of local resources) is just the start of a quite engrossing little game.

The controls are fiddly and buggy. The manual is flash but useless for learning how to play the game. For the patient, it can be absorbing, but it lacks pace. Not a patch on Pirates for playability.</desc>

The objective is to finish off your opponents by knocking him off the platforms or by making the platform disappear by hitting the walls behind your opponents. Your weapon is a disc, which you can throw at your opponent or at the walls. The disc will ricochet off the walls, opening a wide range of angles and attacks. You can also try a direct hit at your opponents, as enough of these will eliminate him as well, but be careful - since it gives him a chance to block your disc, thus gain control of it!
As you progress through the levels, from Novice, through Disciple, up to a Great Guide, your rivals become tougher, platforms take longer hits to disappear, and there are more discs on the playing field.</desc>

		<name>Distant Armies - A Playing History of Chess</name>
		<desc>Think you've played chess before? Even those who are experts at computer chess should take a look at this game. Modern chess is only one variant offered—it has 10 versions of chess rolled onto one disk. Beginning in modern era, the program works its way back in time. The authors mined gaming history books for versions of chess that most people have probably never heard of, both modern and ancient varieties.

The list of chess variants included are: Shatranj, Medieval Chess, Turkish Chess, Decimal Chess, Los Alamos Chess, Courier Chess, Chaturanga, Chinese Chess, Burmese Chess, and Byzantine Chess.

The oldest game on the disk is Chaturanga, a variant invented more than 1000 years ago in India. More recent versions include Medieval and Turkish Chess, played in the middle ages. Decimal Chess, which has a piece that combines a knight and a queen, is a modern variant of an older game. The newest game of the group is Los Alamos Chess, which was designed to run on a MANIAC I computer with a 6x6 board. Strangest looking of the games is Byzantine chess, which has a circular chess board.

This is not just a chess game; it is more of a survey of chess history. The authors provide the histories of the games to place them into context with modern chess. They show how chess changed as it moved across cultures. They cover the basics of chess—the rules, moves—and give players a glossary with chess terms. Finally, they include a bibliography for those who want in-depth information.</desc>

		<name>Dizzy Dice</name>
		<desc>Dizzy Dice is a gambling game simulating a fruit machine. You start with a fixed amount of cash. As you play and get winning combinations, you'll have to choose whether to collect or gamble what you've won. After completing the fruit machine game, you'll get the chance to play a dice game where you have to guess if the next throw will be higher or lower than the current one. 

Dizzy Dice features two game modes. The first one you play as a normal fruit machine. But then there also is the bank mode, where you start with $20 and need to reach $100 to break the first bank. In total there is five banks, each requiring more cash to win. The game is controlled using the keyboard.</desc>

		<path>./Dogfight_v1.02_1293.lha</path>
		<name>Dogfight</name>
		<desc>Dogfight is a two-player game with roots in the same primordial soup as Atari's Combat and other basic dogfighting games.

The two players take sides in an split-screen air battle above France in 1916. Player one starts off as an English pilot on the left side, and player two flies his red Luftwaffe plane from the strip on the right screen. At the end of each strip is a tree, so lift-off requires precision; too early and you will stall to the ground; too late, and you will crash into a tree.

As the two players fly towards each other, the split screen is joint as they reach visual contact, and likewise split off again if they fly away from each other. If a player is shot down, he must take off again from his base, and the winner gains a point. In the time it takes for the other player to lift off, you are at liberty to fly to his base and bomb both him and his hangar. Beware, though, for there is an AA emplacement at the base. The anti air artillery alternates between slow-moving shots and explosive flak, the latter being much more difficult to avoid. If you manage to bomb the artillery, the opposing player is more or less at your mercy – at least until the artillery is regenerated or if he manages to avoid your bombs and shots to shoot you down.

To spice things up, both sides have zeppelins which enter the game from time to time. The zeppelins are big targets but fire at you with great accuracy. In the middle of the playfield is a lake, where German and English U-boats take turns. They can be bombed, but have the same firepower as the AA batteries.

Control of your plane is imperative. Climbing too fast will put you into a stall, while steep dives will speed up your plane. Flying too high will also result in a stall, though this option can be turned off. If you manage to fly straight at the very top of the screen, you can take a shortcut above the mountain at the back of each air field. This will wrap you around to the opposing end of the screen.

Written in AMOS, Dogfight will let the players go on as long as they want, so the winner is usually he who first reaches a score set according to a gentleman's agreement.</desc>

Gameplay is influenced by Commando, with levels scrolling in a single direction at a time and featuring hordes of enemies moving towards you. Buildings and trees offer positions to hide behind, and occasionally launch safe attacks. 

Before each mission you must buy your range of weapons and enough ammunition for them. These include pistols, machine guns, anti-tank devices and grenade launchers, each of which has its own strengths and weaknesses detailed.</desc>

Some people may find the game hard, due to it's unrelenting amount of constantly attacking enemies. Luckily, the controls are simple and it's combat is very similar to the punch/kick attacks of Kung-Fu Master.  

The game was originally titled "The Woo-Lan Kid", but was re-named to suit a younger audience.</desc>

		<name>Dominium</name>
		<desc>Dominium, a distant solar system discovered recently, was acclimatized by settlers from the Earth. After that it  grew rapidly, and war conflicts finally touched up the system. Peace was restored, and Galactic High Council decided to promulgate the Galactic Charter to prevent the recurrence of such events.

Military forces were taken out except elite security forces, generally members of galactic orders. The most prestigious of these orders, Galactic New Round Table, assigned you a rank of Knight, and the Grand Master of the Order gave your a first mission. It will take place on Dominium. This system threatened by a belligerent neighbor has required a military observer.

Upon your arrival after long journey in hibernation box, you were met by Selena of Antioch, Regent of Dominium. She tells you that she refused the ultimatum of her neighbor, who want to conquer Dominium. So, you have to rely on yourself and resources to defeat Dominium Baron, because your general forces are too remote to help you. Selena is grateful to your decision, and she gives you carte blanche to organize the defense of Dominium, because your starting human and material resources are very limited.

The game flows as real-time strategy. Starting with factory, you should build units to examine neighbor lands covered by Fog of War. Finding resources such as gold mines or energy deposits, you should collect them, and build more units or fill them with fuel. The map representing fields, mountains and seas, is covered with a hexagonal grid. To move unit you should point it and destination cell. After that your units are moving between cells with real-time delay, exhausting fuel points per turn. There are 8 units: Jeep, Armor, WB Carrier, Fighter, Frigate, Cruiser, Stell Cargo, and Factory. Each unit is defined by 8 parameters: Speed, Range, Fire, Shield, Tank, Radar, Capacity, and Crew. The values of parameters, which may be increased and decreased also, define the cost of unit. Advisers and Selena will contact you during gameplay and inform you on different strategical events out of your sight.

Finishing the level, 4 digits stellar code is given to you. Such level may be accessed by this code from main menu. The overall game progress may be also saved to file to be loaded later.

The game may be played by single player or by two players via cable. In two players mode may be 2 Barons or none of them.</desc>

		<name>Donkey Kong</name>
		<desc>Donkey Kong is a Platform game and unofficial Amiga conversion of Donkey Kong by Nintendo. Game is developed and published by Bignonia as a shareware, which was released in 1993.

Back in 1993, a shareware company called Bignonia ported Donkey Kong from the Commodore 64 to the Amiga. The final product closely resembled the arcade original in terms of graphics and levels (it includes the elusive pie factory stage). While the game is missing the between-level Ã¢â‚¬Å“How High Can You Go?Ã¢â‚¬Â screens, it did add an extra stage that seemed to make some decent use out of the game physics.

You are Mario, and that big old gorilla, Donkey Kong, has run off with your girlfriend. It's up to you to struggle up those ladders and balance on those beams to rescue your lady fair. She's held captive at the very top. But Donkey Kong is not ready to give her up so easily. He's tossing barrels and fireballs at you at every turn. It's up to you to outmaneuver that wily ape. Good luck, your lady awaits!</desc>

		<name>Donk! - The Samurai Duck</name>
		<desc>Donk!: The Samurai Duck! is a Platform game, developed by The Hidden and published by Supervision, which was released in Europe in 1993.

We have seen it all now. Mutant Turtles, Biker Road Rats, Superhuman Thunder Cats, but Samurai Ducks? Come on! Well, surprising as it may seem, that is just what SupervisionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new hero is, a fair-feathered fowl with a taste for the orient. After a good stint on the Amiga, and then on the consoles, it was only a question of time before the yellow feathered one got the taste for some CD action.

When all the hurly burly has been seen and the mystical smoke clears, Donk is basically just another platform game, albeit with a slightly oriental crispy fried duck aroma to it. He is not the greatest character to grace the video game world, being rather unresponsive and having an annoying habit of falling off any platform you try and position him on when jumping. Animated sequences also link the levels, but they are nothing special and you would not miss them if they were not there at all.

There are 112 uninspiring levels to negotiate and, if you can stick with the programme long enough, you will be able to collect the magical properties necessary for Donk to perform. The shelled one can protect himself with an egg shield and blasting bombs and a simultaneous two player mode is also included with a very restricted viewpoint of the level and reduced sized sprites. This can prove to be a laugh, but at the expense of frustration.

So, yet another flop for the humble CD thirsty machine. A huge stack of great games can only be just around the corner now. Lets hope we can all hang on a bit longer, eh?</desc>

Your aim as the "Doodlebug" is to make your way through five different levels (with three sub-levels each), killing baddies by jumping on their heads until you eventually make it to the final baddie.

The most unique thing about this game is the novel theme at its centre: You can choose between five different coloured pencils to throw at your baddies (presuming you've picked some up). If the pencil's flight path is uninterrupted then they'll draw a useful item for you: Either an Umbrella (for long falls), Ball (to be able to jump onto higher platforms), a Potion (invincibility), a Clock (stops time) and an Eraser (kills everything on screen).</desc>

The game features numerous mission where the player competes with another human player or computer in the execution of the assignment. The tasks require carrying out specific actions before opponent, f.e. retrieve documents and escape from the building, find a camera and make photographs, kill other agent. In each location various items (heavy ball, electrical device, lit cigar) can be found that can be used for setting creative booby traps inside plants, desks, file cabinets and other furniture. All traps can be disarmed with objects found in the rooms. Contact with a trap takes some of the energy. Another difficulty is the third agent that appears after some time pledging traps and attacking the other two. Each agent has a shotgun, which can be used against the enemy. Death means the loss of all items and moves the agent to the initial position.</desc>

This latest in KonamiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ports of their cartridge games isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bad, but there are other Amiga basketball games that are better. It gives a very good illusion of 5 on 5 play, but after a while I noticed that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s really 3 on 3; two players from each team always seem to stay at the other end of the scrolling court. The play is fast and furious, with either a human or computer opponent. Graphics and sound are fair, though I did have some trouble at first keeping track of which guy I was controlling. Solid fare, if nothing outstanding.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Breed</name>
		<desc>Zambaquous has done everything to make life hell for the people of Agamen, and as their King Kayus, the time has come to head out to destroy him. This leads to six levels of horizontally-scrolling shoot ‘em up action, although with some vertical movement as well.

The thing which sets the game apart from every other horizontally-scrolling shoot ‘em up (except Saint Dragon) is that you are riding on the back of a dragon, called Bahamoot. Both you and the dragon have firepower, and holding down the fire button increases Bahamoot’s energy bolt’s ferocity. The dragon’s tail can be controlled indirectly, and because it is indestructible, it can be used either as a shield, or as a weapon in its own right. 

There are power-ups to collect by dismounting from the dragon and walking into them. These include fiery breath, bolts shot from Bahamoot’s tail, homing missiles of sorts, and lightning bolts, with only one ever active at a time. Each level has a time limit.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Fighter</name>
		<desc>Dragon Fighter is a vertically scrolling shooter in which the player rides a dragon. The goal is to solve a hundred levels in order to become the new king. The dragon is affected by gravity which results in the need to counter-steer to avoid falling to the ground. Getting hit lowers the life energy and running out results in a game over because there is only on life available.

Between levels the player visits a town in which power ups like weapon upgrades or life energy are purchased. However, there is also the need to save for the trip to the next of overall 25 towns. The money is earned by shooting enemies in the levels or participating in dice games in the local tavern.</desc>

		<name>Dragonflight</name>
		<desc>Dragonflight is a fantasy role-playing game primarily drawing inspiration from Ultima series. There is no character creation and the player is immediately put in control of the four protagonists as a party. Overworld travel and town navigation are displayed from a top-down perspective; house interiors are not shown graphically. Dungeons, on the other hand, are done in first-person pseudo-3D style, similarly to Dungeon Master. Game progression is non-linear, with the player able to travel to most locations from the onset.

Monsters are sometimes encountered wandering the wilderness, and are also found at fixed locations in the dungeons. When combat initiates, the game switches to a side-scrolling view with a grid displayed above it. The player can move characters over the battle field, attack with melee or ranged weapons, and cast spells, all in a turn-based fashion. Experience points are awarded for vanquishing monsters. Characters can also learn magic by mixing reagents and choosing between the Black and the White schools. The game can be saved at any time on the overworld. There is no auto-mapping feature.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Lord</name>
		<desc>Play one of the three evil wizards all competing to find the magical talisman. To do so, the player must hatch, raise, breed dragons, and use them to spread terror and power across the land! Use these dragons and spells to conquer or help numerous villages and cities across the land while devastating the other wizards also seeking control of the land.

Dragon Lord introduces different levels of gameplay, which may be categorized as the following:nnAlchemynnThe game introduces a complex process of alchemy. Different ingredients have positive and negative results in combination of different types of Magick equipment used for it. Use alchemy to strengthen (or even weaken) own dragons or use them to cast spells at surrounding villages and cities (as well as some alchemical spells for the player's own benefit). Creating a too powerful spell in the Magick Laboratory may introduce an unpleasant explosion in the lab. Ingredients may be obtained through villager tribute or purchase from traveling merchants. 

Note: The game is almost impossible to play without the Alchemical Table of Ingredients.

Dragon BreedingnnThe player may breed several individual dragons in the castle. Each require nurturing and patience before they can hatch and even more so after they hatch! Use alchemy spells to help strengthen the dragon eggs (or they may not hatch at all!).

Dragon Missions and Political MapnnThis feature gives a top-down perspective of the political map around the land. Send dragons to wreck havoc and terror to the surrounding villages and cities, or use them to explore the region and even protect villages and cities from enemy dragons! Attacking villages and cities may prompt them to surrender themselves under the player's control, providing the damage done is sufficient enough. This is also where the player may control the taxation of villages and cities (under player control) as well as any other information regarding them.

Dragon Combat!
Though optional, the player may enter manual combat (as to automatic combat) and enter a top-down, side-scrolling (vertical) arcade combat when attacking villages or cities. Here the player basically uses a dragon to burn anything that remotely looks like a structure.

Note: If there is an enemy dragon near the area, the enemy dragon will come to the defense of that village or city!</desc>

Of course there are enemies which try to stop the player and can be destroyed by using the dragon's fire breath. Besides the artifact collecting, the game plays out as a traditional multi-directional scrolling shooter. There are five levels with eight artifacts each.</desc>

		<desc>Dirk the Daring is a heroic, if clumsy knight. When Princess Daphne was kidnapped by the dragon, Singe, and taken to his castle... Dirk set out to rescue her. Due to a lack of disk and memory space in the systems of the day, the port of the arcade game, Dragon's Lair was split into two parts. The first part covered the half of the game dealing with entering Singe's Castle and saving the Princess. This second part, named Dragon's Lair II: Escape from Singe's Castle completes the game, continuing the adventure of Dirk the Daring after slaying Singe the Dragon.

Dirk the Daring is controlled by the player, who views Dirk's actions on the screen from third-person. The game is reactive and players must press the right controller direction or action button at the right time to have Dirk avoid traps, defeat monsters and otherwise stay alive.</desc>

		<desc>Dragon Spirit is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up which consists of nine stages. Players fly around and destroy everything in their path. Much like in Xevious, action takes place on two planes, both in the sky (where the dragon is flying) and on the ground. The dragon has two different kind of attacks: fire that shoots up the screen, and fire that drops to hit a place on the ground in front of the dragon. Enemies exist both in the air and on the ground, and some can fly up from the ground to the sky.

Players can pick up power-ups, or upgrades, that will help them in their fight. Upgrades can include extra heads on the dragon, health, faster shots, and more. At the end of each stage is a boss that needs to be defeated. Having good upgrades that are not lost from being hit before reaching the bosses will help.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Tiles II - The Tournament</name>
		<desc>Dragon Tiles II: The Tournament is a sequel to the original Dragon Tiles and like that game it is a mahjong solitaire game like Shanghai. The objective of the game is to remove tiles from a stack by matching tiles with the same emblem. Only tiles that have an empty place at either their left or right side can be removed. The main difference from the original game is that it's not only possible to remove two tiles at a time but also sets of four, six or eight tiles. The more tiles that are removed at a time the more points will the player earn. Another difference from the first game is that the play field is larger than the screen size which means that the display scrolls when the mouse cursor is moved.

The game consists of 75 levels and space for 25 more that can be created with a built-in level editor. The appearance of the game can be customized with different tile types: crystal, stone, wood and copper. There are also different emblem sets to choose from: the ones from the original game, as well as flags, runes, Chinese symbols and cards.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Tiles</name>
		<desc>Dragon Tiles is a Puzzle game, developed by S.J. Smith and published by CLR Licenceware, which was released in Europe in 1996.

A variant on Shanghai, the ancient Chinese tile game, released when the official Amiga version was long unavailable.

A number of different types of tile are used, with 4 of each. These are arranged in a particular way, with some on top of others and some next to them. The idea is to remove pairs of tiles progressively so as to leave none remaining. However, a tile can only be moved if it has nothing on top of it, and has free space to either the left or right of it.

This version has 18 different tile layouts, and the tiles have modern pictures on them, ranging from Ghostbusters and Batman logos to computer chips and patterns of atoms, which makes the tiles more distinct and colourful, and takes the game out of its old-fashioned context.</desc>

The player starts with a party of four in the city of Purgatory, equipped with nothing more than.. well - nothing. Worst of all your magic users won't help you out, either, because magic has been banned (to correct this unpleasing situation is one of your main objectives). Other main targets are surviving, getting out of Purgatory and toppling Namtar (maybe getting some decent clothing, one or two shiny swords and the like on your way out).

Gameplay instantly reminds of the Bard's Tale series. Step-by-step first person 3D, opponents materialize out of the air. The combat system is turn based.

Unlike its (spiritual?) predecessors the game features a full-blown skill system, auto-mapping and many places to actually use all these abilities.
Reasonable distribution of your skill points is rather critical.</desc>

Drakkhen is a role-playing game with a visual presentation that combines 3D landscapes and 2D interiors. The player's party will travel overland on a flat terrain made up of vectors, on which 2D objects are zoomed (The same type of engine was later used in Eternam). The player will encounter monsters and fight them in real-time combat, and discover the palaces of the dragon lords. Indoors, the player has to find a way through the maze of chambers, solving puzzles and defeating the minions of the Drakkhen. Party members are depicted in four status windows on the left side of the screen, thus allowing to see their current status and equipment at once.</desc>

The main action in the game is a side-scrolling beat 'em up, in which you alternately control the two characters. They each have their own moves to deal with The Rhino, Electro and other foes. Moves are context-sensitive based on the distance between your character and the opponent. Energy bars decrease as you each take hits. After each section you get comic-book sequences as a reward, and to set the scene of the evolving story.</desc>

		<desc>Ryan, a bartender from a dystopian future can't sleep peacefully for months. His nights are sequences of nightmares and strange dreams, days with frequent black-outs with strange visions, until one night a figure in monk attire appears to him, and tells him the story of the seven evil ones, uniting to destroy to Dreamweb, the only barrier between the world and darkness. The monk makes a proposition: Ryan becomes the deliverer: the one who would keep the Dreamweb safe by killing those who try to destroy it.

Descending into paranoia and just wanting dreams to stop, Ryan accepts the mission, then wakes up in a puddle of cold sweat, next to his beloved girlfriend in her house, and late for work. Again.

DreamWeb is a top-down adventure game set in a gritty futuristic/dystopian city. Each location takes only a small portion of the screen without panning (except an optional small zoom window in the corner that follows the cursor), with the player interacting with objects and people by simply clicking them. Ryan has a limited inventory space, and as a lot of objects can be picked up (many without any use), the player must rationalize what might be useful and just filler. Dialogue is straight forward, with no options, but still required to advance in the game (to find new locations, for instance). In situations where many adventure games often feature an indirect approach to solve a  problem, Ryan often faces himself with situations where it's "killed or be killed", which result in deaths  (sometimes of innocents).

The story isn't much developed inside the game, but the original release of the game included Diary Of a (Mad?) Man, a 40-page diary telling the descent of Ryan into madness, or his destiny, written by Stephen Marley provides a complete background to the events leading to the start of the game.</desc>

In Dr. Fruit the player takes the role of Dr. Falken who was transformed into a strawberry. Now he has to dig trough his garden in this Mr. Do! variant.

A level consists of dirt, free places (normally arranged to ways) and fruits. To reach the next level, Dr. Falken needs to pick up all fruit. If can't (or doesn't want to) use the existing ways to reach them, he digs new ways into the dirt. However, there are also enemies lurking on the field which are restricted to the free ways. An enemy can be disposed of by shooting him or by digging away the dirt under a rock so it falls on his head.

Dr. Fruit is rubbish to play, avoid.</desc>

		<name>Drip</name>
		<desc>Drip is a single player, keyboard controlled, shareware game for one or two players.

Drip is a cool drop and he's partying. Some dastardly person/thing has tapped into his network of pipes and has stopped his supply of party juice so Drip has to race around all the pipes and rust them in order to restore the flow.

So the objective in this game is to travel round a pipe network covering every pipe within a time limit. Naturally this is too easy so there are obstacles and problems to overcome so apart from the bad guys chasing him Drip has to avoid acid, plasma, ice-cubes, electric bubbles and lasers as contact with any of these will cost a life. There are also fluffy clouds which, when they touch a pipe will un-rust it.
There are a couple of things that will aid Drip, he can travel off the top/bottom/edge of the screen and re-appear at the other side, stars occasionally appear on the screen and these give him a shield which kills enemies on contact, and then there are the party balloons. Balloons are essential on some levels, catching one allows Drip to float around the screen free of the pipe network, thus he can bypass his pursuers but more importantly he can reach pipe sections that are not connected to the rest of the network.

The game has sixteen levels which appear in a random order apart from the final boss level. The levels are themed Acid, Ice and Fire and are coloured green, blue and orange accordingly.</desc>

		<name>Duck Tales - The Quest for Gold</name>
		<desc>This game follows the adventures of Scrooge McDuck and his three nephews, Huey, Dewey and Louie.

The aim of the game is shown in the introduction. Flintheart Glomgold challenges Scrooge to a competition to see who the richest duck in the world is. They each have 30 days to see who can get the most money together and finally their dispute will be settled.

Scrooge's office is your headquarters. Here you have three options ? you can go exploring for treasure, play the stock market or dive into your money bin, occasionally finding a rare coin which adds to you treasure total. You need to get some money first before you can play the stock market though.

You main source of income comes from the exploration map which hangs on the wall. From here, you can pick a destination, which you can travel to. There are four different scenarios when travelling to various parts of the world. It's these levels that are the most fun. You can choose to go mountain climbing, jungle bashing, search a cavern, or photograph some rare animals depending on your location. On screen information tells you which scenario it is, how long the trip will take and how much the treasure is worth. There's also an island in the Indian Ocean you can visit to check on who's winning between you and Glomgold.

You have to fly to each location and your transport is LaunchPad McQuack! You have to take off at the airport and fly to the destination. There are obstacles along the way though, watch out for powerlines (these are really funny, you run into them and boing! bounce back); hot air balloons dropping refrigerators, anvils, 10 ton weights and pianos; cumulo nimbus clouds shooting lightening and fluffly clouds; whales blowing water out their spouts; tall mountains, rocky outcrops, fireworks, hay barns among other things. Landing on the other side requires a special skill ? Launchpads! You have to crash into the airport to land! Crash the plane though and it takes two days of your valuable time limit for Gyro Gearloose to fix it.

Using Huey, Dewey and Louie, each being one of your three lives in the mountain climbing level, you must get from the base of the mountain to the top to get your treasure. Using the boys, you can hop from ledge to ledge, or when the going gets tough, use your grappling hook! This is a lot of fun and requires precision. There are also caves in the side of the mountain, which can transport you up or down the mountain. But watch out for bears in the caves. Other obstacles i</desc>

		<path>./Dune_v3.0_1156.lha</path>
		<name>Dune</name>
		<desc>Based on the legendary Frank Herbert novel of the same name and visually inspired by the 1984 David Lynch movie, Dune is a strategy-adventure hybrid where the player takes the role of young Paul Atreides, the son of Duke Leto. The Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV has given the Atreides House the rights to manage the extraction of the most precious substance in the entire universe - the Melange, commonly known as Spice in the desolate desert planet Arrakis (Dune), the only place in the universe capable of producing the substance. While everything indicates the offer is a trap orchestrated by their enemies the Harkonnen, the Atreides family agrees on moving, as he who controls the spice, controls the universe.

The player arrives in Arrakis with the mission of contacting and convincing the Fremen tribes residing in sietches (desert settlements) near the Atreides palace to harvest the spice. Harvesting is the most important part of the game, required to purchase equipment from the smugglers and appease the emperor. To speed up the process of harvesting, the player can equip the tribes with harvesters to increase production and ornis to protect them from the gigantic protectors of the planet: Shai-Hulud - the sandworms. 

However, the spice doesn't last forever and new sietches must be prospected before having a mining crew assigned, but the player cannot run Southwards forever, as the Harkonnen enemy controls the North of the Planet, dangerously close to the Atreides Palace. Soon after the initial batches are sent to the Emperor, the player will have to actively deal with the Harkonnen, who will try to take control of player Sietches. For those, Fremen tribes can be assigned to military training with Gurney Halleck, but before doing such work Paul must have a certain reputation, gained by the control of Arrakis.

As the game advances, the player will untap Paul's latent powers, as well as meeting other characters from the Dune universe, such as Duke Leto, Jessica, Thufir Hawat, Duncan Idaho, Harah, Chani, Stilgar and Liet Kynes, the mastermind behind the ecological plans on Dune - the ultimate goal.</desc>

		<desc>Dungeon Master is a role-playing game where the player selects four adventurers and descend into the depths of the dungeon. The gameplay is reminiscent of the 3D dungeon crawl type of role-playing games popularized by Wizardry and The Bard's Tale. However, unlike these games, Dungeon Master features real-time combat, which requires the player to click on the opponent in order to execute an attack. Another notable aspect of the game is its growth system: instead of gathering experience points and leveling up, characters improve by repeatedly using the same action. Spellcasting involves selecting and combining symbols, which can be arranged as rune sequences. The game also allows the player to directly interact with objects in the game world through a point-and-click interface.

Above are three rows of targets moving around. The targets consist of rabbits, owls, duck and boxes with numbers. You move your gun left and right in order to hit the targets, and you earn more scores for hitting those on the higher rows. You have a limited amount of bullets, but hitting the numbered boxes add more to your arsenal. While the rabbits and owls require just one hit, the ducks will change colours several times before being eliminated. When only five targets remain, the screen changes colour and they must be hit before they leave the screen forever. As you progress, the speed is elevated.</desc>

		<desc>Dyna Blaster or Dynablaster is a name that has been given to the European releases of the game of the Bomberman. It's a strategic, maze-based video game franchise originally developed by Hudson Soft.

Most games in the Bomberman franchise largely revolve around two modes of play; single player campaigns where the player must defeat enemies and reach an exit to progress through levels, and multiplayer modes where players must attempt to eliminate each other and be the last one standing. Gameplay involves strategically placing down bombs, which explode in multiple directions after a certain amount of time, in order to destroy obstacles and kill enemies and other players. The player can pick up various power-ups, giving them benefits such as larger explosions or the ability to place more bombs down at a time. The player is killed if they touch an enemy or get caught up in a bomb's explosion, including their own, requiring players to be cautious of their own bomb placement.</desc>

There are six levels to fight through before they can get down to the serious business of rescuing their friend. Eighteen different types of creature oppose them, ranging from the Sumo Pig to the Boxing Crocodile!

A great two-player mode is included: you can beat each other up if the action dies down temporarily! Bonus levels have been included to boost the content that bit more and, naturally, every level has a huge fat mega-nasty just make sure things do not get too easy.

Playing Dynamite Dux is rather like watching a cartoon; the graphics are bold and bright, and the tune that plays throughout is the sort of bouncy jolly stuff that generally accompanies cartoons. Visually and sonically, it is a very enjoyable game.

Disappointingly, despite the light-hearted nature of the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s presentation, it lacks an essential element of addictiveness. Though quite playable, it is a bit easy to get through the first couple of levels, and as a result, they become quite tedious when you play through them again and again. Lastability rating, therefore is fairly low. It is an accurate conversion; unfortunately, though, the original was not all that hot.</desc>

Gameplay is platform-based, with 12 vertically-scrolling levels, each containing around 50 diamonds - the more of these you can collect, the higher your score.

		<name>Dynasty Wars</name>
		<desc>Originating in the arcades, Dynasty Wars is a beat-em-up set during the Three Kingdoms Era of the Chinese history, and is, more specifically, based on the Tenchi o Kurau manga adaptation of the story. The player adopts the identity of an ancient Chinese warrior, and riding on horseback has to eliminate all his opponents, mostly infantry and archers. 

Four historical characters from the time period can be controlled: Zhang Fei (fights with a halberd), Liu Bei (broadsword), Guan Yu (a Chinese pole weapon known as guan dao), and Zhao Yun (pike); some of the character names are misspelled in translated versions. The characters are distinguished by their health and strength parameters.

The game uses a lateral scroll and the player can move in all four directions. A novelty is the attack system: when pressing fire the energy of the attack will load up as the warrior moves his weapon up and backwards, in order to gain momentum. The more the player can keep fire pressed, the more powerful the attack will be. In addition, so-called "tactics" can be used at specific moments; these are powerful area attacks that deplete the protagonist's HP in process and range from summoning an ambush partner and causing rocks slide down slopes.</desc>

Prisoners, released from the derelict constructions, are collected for return to base.

In Dyter 07, the little prisoners are replaced by equally little scientists who, upon repatriation, busy themselves building new weapons to bolt onto your chopper. Another twist is that the chopper carries a small tank for land-based battle plus an amphibious craft for aquatic attacks. Destroy all the robot enemies specified by the radar and you can exit this landscape to the next. And that's about yet lot.</desc>

Finishing the stages you interrogate with space station's inhabitants to take an additional information (true or false) to find finally the coordinates of the Cyborgs' mother planet.</desc>

		<name>Ebonstar</name>
		<desc>EbonStar is a Shoot 'Em Up game, developed by Dreamers Guild and published by Microillusions, which was released in Europe in 1988.

In contrast to the complexities of their excellent Faery Tale Adventure, Microillusions have now come up with a game of surprising simplicity.

Ebonstar takes elements from a few ancient coin-ops and with a neat vector graphic effect, results in a game rather like those oldies Space Wars and Stella Castle. A single static grid is the playfield throughout the game. Moving at random around the grid is a kind of black hole that swallows up everything in its range. The object is to destroy the void by shooting a bolt of energy straight down the maintenance beam projected by the constantly circling Arch. Up to four players can be on the grid at one time. The playersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ aims are twofold: to destroy the hole and also to force each other into its lifeless depths.

Each player controls a ship armed with an energy bolt cannon. These repel other ships on impact, and so can be used to push other players around. From the Arch, drone ships and a few other aliens are launched as well as a few extra weapons that can be caught by the players.

Simple games can often be some of the best games, but this is not really the case with Ebonstar. The void moves around with absolutely mesmerising smoothness appearing frightingly how one would imagine a real black hole to be. The explosion has been very well done, too but Ebonstar plays at far too slow a pace with too little action to create the level of excitement it attempts. Its music, sound effects and most of its graphics are incredibly simple, which coupled with the tedious gameplay and high asking price make this a bit of a non-starter.

Inside Ebonstar is a great and fascinating game dying to come out Ã¢â‚¬â€ unfortunately the black hole seems to have sucked away MicroillusionsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ usual brilliance.</desc>

		<desc>Eco is an action strategy game of sorts, which sets the player in charge initially of a small single-celled organism and challenges the player to guide its evolution. 

The initial tasks are to roam around finding food and then find a potential mate. Depending on the organism's status, different predators will be after it - a radar is displayed to indicate where these are at any given time. Once this is done, the player is taken to a screen displaying the species' genes, and has the chance to modify one of them, thus resulting in evolution. Eventually the organism can evolve far enough to become plant, insect, fish, or even human.</desc>

		<name>Edd the Duck 2 - Back with a Quack!</name>
		<desc>I don't know about you, but I find Andi Peters' sidekick to be one of the most irritating things ever to grace my TV, and the thought of two games based on the same character is enough to send shivers down my spine. But still I sit here playing it, and I have to admit that, even with my low expectations, I was disappointed. With the exception that the main character is a duck, this game has almost nothing to do with the inbred son of Sweep from the Sooty show. Surely the most obvious thing to do would be to sample his kazoo voice, but no. This Edd quacks.

The game falls somewhere between Treasure Island Dizzy and Fantasy World Dizzy, with a little Dizzy thrown in for good measure. In short, it is a scrolling platform game with attempted cute graphics and very little in the way of lasting gameplay.

As Edd you must travel through the Wild West in your best cowboy outfit, avoiding such terrors as large cowboy hats and electric sparks that travel up and down telegraph wires. Most of this is done by jumping, although you can use your gun to shoot down the opposition. Hang on a moment - Edd the Duck with a gun? Surely not! Well, OK then, it is not a real gun. All this weapon is capable of firing are custard pies which merely stun the enemy for a short period of time.

Everything about this game reeks of budget quality. Fine if you want a five-minute platform game, but there are so many better examples of the genre about.

Cheats:
On the title screen, type Ã¢â‚¬Å“'IANWANTSTOCHEAT' and now press the '.' on the main keyboard. During play press 'HELP' to advance levels.</desc>

Like most child-oriented licenses of the day, his first computer outing was a platform game, scrolling vertically and resembling Rainbow Islands, although much simplified.

Edd must progress up the levels within the time limit (water will come up to drown him - presumably polluted water through which a duck can't swim), while collecting every star. Bad guys can be stunned by shooting them, which makes them safe to touch, although nothing other than Edd actually dies. The levels are all themed around particular areas of the BBC offices, including a sci-fi set and the weather room.</desc>

		<name>Elfmania</name>
		<desc>Elfmania is a Fighting game, developed by Terramarque and published by Renegade, which was released in Europe in 1994.

Beautiful, colourful or cute things can often be the most dangerous - they can lull you into a false sense of security and then striking out when least expected, stunning you like a rocket-charged python. Elfmania is such a thing. Who would have thought, after Streetfighter 2, Body Blows and Mortal Kombat, that what's basically a bunch of fighting fairies would inspire an office into aggressive bouts of one-on-one fisticuffs and high-pitched screaming.

In single-player mode you start off with cash in the form coins which buy the services of fighters. More experienced ones cost more dosh, so at the beginning you can only choose between one of three characters, who cost $75 each. Beating the hell out of each enemy (in a very nice elf-like fashion, of course) gives you more coins, allowing you to hire tougher fighters for later bouts.

In two-player mode you can have a quick flick through the fighters and, well, I never knew that elves had such a varied racial culture. There's a sumo wrestling Japanelf, a vicious and contemptible sword wielding Turkelf and a king equipped with a fiendishly destructive mallet. These three constitute the toughest enemies, but because everyone is yours for a price, if you win enough bouts, you can hire these fighters later on in the game.

Okay, a cute beat 'em up might sound perverse, but Elfmania has managed to prove two things: 1.) Consoles are not the only place you can find decent beat 'em ups. 2.) You don't have to rip anyone's head off, have blood spouting everywhere and have special moves that are about as easy to execute as an American mass murderer to produce a top class, strategic and fun game. Very well done.</desc>

Trade goods and earn money slowly or seek and destroy other ships. As you earn ranks, you'll be offered some missions to finally reach the ultimate rank - ELITE. Very hard and very entertaining.

Modifications are: new ships, Warrior MkIV and Colubrid II. New equipment: Climatech Universal Laser Cooler and M2031A3 Heavy Military Laser. Some visual adjustments are made e.g. planet colours in space now fit to colours in local navigation chart, etc. Equipment is now splitted into two pages if more then 15 equipments are available. Rating point table halved, so you reach the E-L-I-T-E status and the missions earlier.</desc>

Money can also be gained by other means beside trading; these include undertaking military missions, bounty hunting, asteroid mining, and even piracy. As the player character earns money, he becomes able to upgrade his ships with enhancements such as better weapons, shields, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, etc.</desc>

		<name>Elvira II : The Jaws of Cerberus</name>
		<desc>Elvira II: The Jaws of Cerberus is an adventure/RPG first-person game. You begin by choosing one of the four classes for your character (which determines your starting attributes, such as Strength, Intelligence etc.).

For movement, you click the arrows in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Collecting items can be done via clicking on them in the first-person view window and dragging them into your inventory. (You can also click the "room" icon to see all the items that you've found in the room so far.) Should you encounter monsters, you fight by clicking on them. You can choose one of the four tactics (Normal, Defense, Fierce, Berserk) when fighting, and there's a number of different weapons you can find in the game. If you meet someone who doesn't want to murder you (a very rare occurrence) you can talk to him, though conversations are pretty simple and consist mainly of short phrases.

As you defeat monsters, explore the game world and cast spells (see below), you get experience. Once you have enough experience, you gain a level, and your attributes improve.

Thanks to Elvira's spellbook she gave you, you have the ability to create and cast spells. Some spells can be used to heal yourself, protect you in combat or damage your enemies, other are necessary to solve certain puzzles and make progress in the game. Creating a spell requires you to be of high enough level and to have the proper ingredients, different for every spell. The ingredients are usually gone forever once the spell is ready, so beware and don't use up any items vital for completing the game! Casting a spell requires you to use some amount of Power Points (PP), which regenerate automatically but slowly. What's more, you only get a limited number of castings when you prepare a spell, so don't waste them.</desc>

The levels are often difficult to master: you must learn the rules of each, maneuver around obstacles, and avoid the merciless creatures.

In each level, your objective is to gather all the emeralds in the allotted time. Besides emeralds, you will find: diamonds, which carry three times the point value of emeralds; rocks, which you can topple onto creatures; explosives; keys to linked rooms; wheels that attract enemy bugs and more. Emerald Mine is fast paced, but il doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t requite the reflexes of Superman. One or two people can play: two-player mode lets you and a friend play simultaneously as a team. The game saves 30 high scores for each level on the copy protected disk.

A smooth-scrolling view screen displays part of the large playing area. The sound effects add to the game without distracting you, and the graphics are adequate.

IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m addicted. My children love Emerald Mine. Even my jaded friends are hooked. If you want a game you will not quickly tire of, dig in!</desc>

		<desc>The 'New Age' arrives in software. At last the Amiga can boast a game you will be proud to boot up when your crystal analyst comes round to listen to your collection of Brian Eno LPs. The Game of Harmony is one of those games in which gameplay is everything - The Game of Harmony is very much back to basics.

Asteroids type manner, you have to knock pairs of matching balls together to make them disappear. If, however, you send different coloured spheres careering into each other, you have to get rid of. As game-plays go, it requires dexterity, subtlety and restraint, so if your idea of a good time is a few rounds of Rambo III, it is quite likely that this is not the game for you. Frankly, The Game of Harmony can be bloody irritating, you can be just about to complete a difficult manoeuvre and a little misjudgement or slip of the joystick can give you twice as much work as you started with. Then again, it is also highly addictive. The Game of Harmony is that rarest of games Ã¢â‚¬â€œ an original.

After a few hours of dabbing with the game, I got the feeling that although The Game of Harmony is original, stylish and highly playable, there is something about it that makes it fall short of being a true classic. It could be that it is a little fussy for my tastes, dare I say a little poncy. I am just not sure that the aggro involved in getting through the game is worth it. All I can be sure of is that after reviewing it, I have an irresistible urge to reach for a Napalm Death tape and give the volume control a severe yank.</desc>

		<desc>Rather than copying Sensible Soccer or Kick Off, this football game features a number of comical and unrealistic touches. Although the view is top-down, the pitch is small and square, and the players appear huge on it. A range of moves including overhead kicks, trapping the ball and quick 1-2 passes can be mastered.

Before each match your team can choose special moves to assign to each player - power shots with ludicrous curve, super dribbling (making the ball stick to your foot), and a Barge power to push players out of the way. A full world cup tournament is offered, which up to 8 human players can partake in, as well as single exhibition matches. The action replays feature a VCR-style control.</desc>

		<name>Star Wars : The Empire Strikes Back</name>
		<desc>The Empire Strikes back is the sequel to the brilliant arcade game Star Wars.  While it shares many of the earlier game's characteristics, somehow it doesn't come off quite as well...

The Empire Strikes Back has four levels. The first has you blasting away at Imperial Probe Droids and their transmissions as you try to stop them notifying the Empire. The second level has you trying to bring down Imperial walkers, either by
shooting them through the view slits, or by casting tow cables at their legs. The third level is eerily reminiscent of the first level of Star Wars: shoot TIE fighters and their fireballs. The final level is just annoying. You steer through an asteroid field.

The game as a whole includes many classic sound effects and samples from the movie, but as a whole it lacks the appeal of the earlier game.</desc>

In this case, he broke the heart of wisdom and the only way to bring the story to a good end is to collect the pieces from the five levels of this game. The protagonist is the magician Kurgan who jumps through the multi-directional scrolling platform levels.

A big boss stands at the end of each level, but defeating him is not enough to get access to the next: the hidden parts of the heart need to be found first. Besides platforming, there are are lot of enemies to fight. To do so, the magician has twelve weapons at his disposal which need a certain amount of energy to use. Just like the other two bars (jumping and life energy) it can be refilled by collecting crystals.</desc>

		<name>Amiga Encounter</name>
		<desc>Amiga Encounter is a Shooter game, developed and published by Novagen, which was released in 1991.

Blimey, this takes me back a bit! One ot the first games I ever had on my trusty but now deceased C64. Encounter was also the first game to appear from the Howard Hughes of the programming world.

Encounter is basically an extension of the age-old Battlezone scenario, and when it was originally released, was praised for its (then) stunning fast filled graphics - and the lack of glitch associated with the genre. Unfortunately, what you considered hot and stunning in the old days now looks decidedly dated.

The basic idea of the game is to patrol an oddly-coloured desert and take out the enemy space-ships and missiles before they get to you. However, punctuating the barren landscape are a series of metallic columns, and these can be used to deflect shots and to hide behind. And thatâ€™s it.

Although this may sound a little damning, thereâ€™s no doubt that Encounter is a playable little blast. The graphics, whilst not pushing back any barriers, are smoothly updated and the enemy ships are fast and deadly. The trouble is that there just isnâ€™t enough to do, and when you consider that Novagen are asking twenty-odd quid for it, I donâ€™t think that pure nostalgia offers enough for your money.</desc>

		<name>Enemy - Tempest Of Violence</name>
		<desc>Enemy: Tempest of Violence is an action game shown from the side. A seemingly abandoned space ship was the goal of a research team. Unfortunately aliens were still there and assaulted the humans. Now the player's mission is to purge all 34 floors. There is a fix set of objectives which have to be completed within a time limit, e.g. rescuing survivors, destroying alien eggs, finding weapons or killing aliens. Some of the objectives are not at the same place in each playthrough.

The defying feature of this game is variety in gameplay and objectives. It introduces more gameplay elements as it goes on and the player has to solve sections which rely on quick action, solving puzzles or both. Besides the expected movement options, the player character also has some more exotic moves like double jumps and walking backwards while shooting; equipment includes a variety of weapons, e.g. grenades or a silencer, and tools like a automap illustrator (complete maps can be found on computer terminals) or a movement sensor. During the course of the game the player may have temporary assistance by AI controlled characters. The game also features an optional help system which blends in symbols representing the next course of action, e.g. a light bulb means that there is a puzzle to solve and a white flag means the level is in an unwinnable state.</desc>

		<desc>Featuring the English national squad in a top-down soccer game, England Championship Special represents British publisher Grand Slam's attempt to cash in on both England's respectable semi-final entry at the 1990 World Cup and the popularity of Anco's acclaimed Kick Off series.

With its 1991 release, English Championship Special is somewhat awkwardly set in between the 1990 World Cup (England made the semi finals, its best result since 1966, then lost to Germany and to Italy in the third-place match) and the European Championship of 1992, to which the "Championship Special" part of the title refers. The squad composition is based on the 1991 status quo, which means you'll go into the Euro tournament with World Cup veterans such as Waddle, Beardsley and Wright, but without 1992 players like Alan Shearer or Alan Smith, infamous substitute to Gary Lineker in the Sweden match.</desc>

The gameplay uses a forced perspective top-down view, and strongly resembles Gauntlet in the way Hasrinaxx moves, shoots, avoids enemies and collects health items. 

Matters are more complex in terms of the spell system however. 32 spells can be collected and used, including a fireshield to allow you to pass fiery areas, water and fire walls to attack immediate enemies, a deathlight to clear the area of enemies, and a teleport. You can also summon one of 4 Elemental beings, who can be controlled simultaneously to attack creatures for you. Only 8 spells can be carried at a time, but you can drop and later re-collect them.</desc>

You control each of the 4 men separately, each of them starting within their own quarters on different floors of the camp, and can always switch between them. 

The gameplay has a similar feel to isometric-view Spectrum games, notably The Great Escape and Head Over Heels. Collecting and using objects is a significant part of your task – lock-picks for the low-security doors, keys for the more secure ones, German uniforms to allow you to move around freely, and shovels to dig for freedom. You must avoid entering forbidden areas – do this and you will be placed in solitary confinement and have your equipment confiscated – if you attempt to run from the guards in such areas they will shoot at you.</desc>

Operation Snowball is similar to the arcade game Cabal insofar as it resembles Operation Wolf but adds a roll manoeuvre. You must fire snowballs at people who are trying to make a catapult, and destroy the shots they aim at you.

Eggsterminator places you at the top of a cliff, which has 5 ledges containing a birdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nest. Birds will periodically land on these and lay eggs, which you must collect. Contact with the birds themselves causes you to fall and lose time. Ice NÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Igloos involves using your axe to collect ice, and taking it to your incomplete igloo to complete it. Avoid the seals, as contact with these costs you time.

Miami Ice is a clone of Tapper, except that instead of beer you are serving ice cream to people. From one side of the screen you must ensure that each line has enough ice creams sent down it to match the number of people coming. Also ensure that you are ready to collect the empty cones when these are returned. Evidently, the taste of wafers is not popular near the poles.

The final event is not present on the C64. It is Barbearian, a one-on-one fight with a polar bear. The ice melting away sets the time limit in this game.</desc>

Track and Field: running, relay, hurdles, steeplechase, discus, shot putt, hammer throw, javelin, long jump, triple jump, high jump, pole vault;nnWater Sports: free style, breast stroke, back stroke, butterfly, relay, diving;nnFighting: boxing, wrestling, judo, fencing.

Eliminating the different distances in single events (such as 100m, 200m, 400m and 800m freestyle), though, The Games' "over 30 events" melt down to 22; and counting only those which differ to some degree in their execution, it boils down to six: running, throwing, jumping, swimming, diving and fighting.

The Games '92 is divided in three parts: During preparation time, manage and train twelve athletes by sentencing them to gym time and daily practice. Game time advances with each action until the olympic games begin.
In pactice, heats and finals, you take control of your athletes and drive them to peak performances through rhythmical tapping of the cursor keys, and the occasional press of the space bar.
In the database section, you can read up on previous games and winning athletes, and take a look at Barcelona location maps.</desc>

		<desc>Crime is getting out of control in Liberty City, and to combat the problem, the LCPD establishes a new unit, called ESWAT (Enhanced Special Weapons and Tactics). Police officers who are promoted to this unit wear a cyber-suit that contains state-of-the-art military equipment including two Turbo-Booster Thrusters, extra ammunition, and increased protection. In order to become an ESWAT member, all a dedicated police officer has to do is arrest enough criminal masterminds to progress through the ranks, which include Captain, Assistant Chief, and Chief.

ESWAT: Cyber Police is a horizontal-scrolling beat 'em up where you have to make your way from left to right and defeat a mastermind. There are 15 stages to complete, and have you patrolling through Liberty streets, car yards, stadiums, restaurants, the CBD, construction sites, and boat docks. While you're out on patrol, you can pick up ammunition, and the amount you get varies. For example, on some levels, ammo may be worth 10 bullets, while in others, you may get 60 bullets. Once you have obtained the cyber-suit, you wear it for the duration of the game.</desc>

		<desc>E.T's Rugby League is fondly remembered by gamers of the era and for many would still represent the pinnacle of rugby league video games. While at its heart E.T's Rugby League is just World Class Rugby with the six tackle rule, adding a play the ball and removing two players per side takes the experience from good to great. You get more room to throw the ball around, offloading becomes even more deadly, half breaks are more frequent and your joystick lives a longer, happier life for not being violently waggled every ten seconds.</desc>

		<desc>Conversion of Tecmo's arcade soccer game World Cup 1990, though the computer version has been licensed to the European Championship of 1992. It's a standard isometric view arcade style soccer game - easy, simple, as mediocre as a soccer game can get. You can choose from 25 European teams represented in that tournament, although there's hardly a difference between playing, for example, Greece and Italy. If you like the arcade game, you might find this one a bit nostalgic-- although not necessary fun at all. There are simply far too many better action-oriented soccer games to occupy your time with.</desc>

The game can be viewed top-down (similar to the Kick Off games) or side-on (similar to Manchester United Europe). Three different passing modes are offered, with the aim of providing precise one-touch passing or the ability for long-range direct through-balls. The match options include 10 skill levels, variable wind, five different pitch conditions, and variable match lengths.

The game scrolls horizontally at a slight angle, and recreates the coin-op's close-up zoom effect after a player scores. Only a small area of the pitch is on screen at a time, but there is a scanner to show the whole pitch.

Although the game has a referee, he often loses attention, and these moments give you a chance to foul, punch or side-swipe opposition players. One and two player options are included.</desc>

		<name>Euro Soccer</name>
		<desc>Euro Soccer is a pile of steaming poo, you've got more control over the population of rabbit colony than the ball in this game. It's often a case of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpress the button and gamble away' with regards to passing, as the ball always travels to the nearest player you're facing, not matter how far away he is. One moment it'll travel about half a metre and the next it'll be right up the other end of the pitch. 'Playability' is obviously a word that isn't in Flair's dictionary. The players are uncontrollably slow and they often perform a number of stupid automatic moves, like chesting the ball away if it arrives at shoulder height, which is worrying. Computer controlled players have a disturbing habit of running away from the ball whenever it nears them, making the defence look like stupid and they generally act with little intelligence. Aftertouch, diving headers and bicycle kicks are about as existent as Macaulay Culkin's talent - the entire match consists of milling about, attempting a few 'graphically-challenged' sliding tackles and running with the ball as if it's nailed to your athlete's foot. Even the crowd sound as if they're embarrassed to be in a game this bad - all they seem to be able to muster up is a monotone "Uuuuuuurh!" all the bloody time.</desc>

The enemies are in many types, shapes and colours - spaceships, 'molecules', geometric figures, etc. If a spaceship flies too slowly, then it has a tendency to fall down. The player has 2 lives.</desc>

		<name>Executioner, The</name>
		<desc>The Executioner is a Shooter game, developed by Avant Garde and published by Hawk, which was released in Europe in 1991.

This game is as original as Thrust, Gravitar, Choplifter and Olds. Prettier, perhaps, with some extra bells and whistles but essentially the same. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s absolutely nothing wrong with taking a great idea, improving and developing It. But with this game itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard to see where the improvements have been carried out. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sad, especially when you look at some of the other games recently released, such as Utopia, Megalomania and Magic Pockets. All three have taken a tried and trusted game formula and pushed it one step further by enhancing the gameplay, and adding something fresh and exciting.

There are really too many better games to buy with your money. Sorry, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no way this Executioner is a killer.</desc>

		<desc>This action game combines shoot 'em up and platform elements, as you control a flying man who can gain an exoskeletal suit for extra protection (hence the name). Your task is to progress from left to right in each level, either along the ground or by using the arrangement of platforms. Most of the baddies can be avoided rather than shot, and this is often easier, especially as you can duck or jump to avoid them. As well as a standard gun (activated by tapping fire) you also have a limited number of missiles to take out installations (activated by holding down fire, which makes autofire facilities useless). The scrolling is flick-screen, perhaps as the game was designed for the C64, and the Amiga version was identical to the ST's.</desc>

		<name>Extase</name>
		<desc>The screen display in Extase depicts a symmetrical network of wires, some buttons, some fuses, some switches, and a picture of a female android in the middle. The overall aim is to restore sensory functions to the android, one in each level. All of this is done against an opponent, either human or computer, who controls the opposite half of the board.

This is done by guiding electrical pulses through each of the wires, however this can only be done once the wires have been woken up. You are in control of a cursor, which can click on the activation buttons to release a ball, which you direct using the cursor to reactivate wires on its path. Switches must be set to make all parts of this available – this can only be done when no ball is active.

Electrical sparks move around to make life harder, by destroying balls and fuses. Fortunately these can be 'zapped' using the cursor. New fuses can be generated by guiding a power beam into the fusebox, which is located centrally – simply pick up and place a generated fuse.

Better still, you can steal your opponent's, which is one of many ways the game becomes directly competitive. The two cursors cannot occupy the same space on screen, so hitting your opponent's cursor will jolt it. You can also adjust switches on both sides of the board, and summon sparks for your opponent to deal with. As the android is reactivated during the level it shows a range of facial expressions as a visual reward and measure of your progress.</desc>

		<name>Exterminator</name>
		<desc>This obscure coin-op comes from Gottlieb, a company best known for their pinball machines. The plot is that all kinds of mayhem have broken out in a nondescript street in the suburbs of Chicago. Swarms of insects have mutated into ferociously lethal creatures, rats and frogs have turned vicious, while toy tanks have come to life! Clearly your average, everyday pest control isn't going to be able to cope so it's time to call in the EXTERMINATOR!

Who? Well he's certainly no wimp, all he needs to sort things out are his bare hands - and in this game you control one such disembodied hand. Houses are represented by a series of 3-D rooms where various baddies come buzzing, trundling, scurrying and leaping toward you. You can deal with them by slamming your fist down from a great height, shooting them by moving your hand to the side of the screen, or grabbing them in midair.

Simply totaling the creatures isn't enough; the Exterminator also has to clean the floor! On the first level, cans must be smashed open to turn a tile over to your colour. Create a vertical line and you complete a level. Once all the rooms in a house are cleared, it's onto to the next house. Clear all seven houses and there's an Ultimate Challenge with a huge bonus points prize!

To aid you in this task you might like to take along a companion. On the Amiga it's a simultaneous game with players choosing either to cooperate or compete Ã¢â‚¬â€œ each creates his own colour tiles.</desc>

		<desc>Eye is closely based on the board game with the same name. The game is played with two to four players on a board with differently coloured squares. Each player has playing stones of one colour and the goal to get a certain amount of the own stones on the corresponding fields. The spin on this concept is that the board is placed on two rotatable spirals which change the square distribution on the field when used. During each turn, a player has a different amount of moves available (changes depending on the current match situation); each move consisting of moving a square or turning a spiral. This computer version also allows some rule modifications in comparison to the original game and all opponents can be replaced by the AI.</desc>

There are various scenarios for each, with air-to-air or ground missions, in "cold war" and full-scale war situations. Players can build up their pilot ranks through completed missions and medals.

The game actually has two flight modes. In the "authentic" mode, you have only 2 weapon bays, but you have higher stealth rating. In the "theoretical" mode, you have 4 weapon bays like F-19 Stealth Fighter, but your plane is easier to detect due to a lower stealth rating.</desc>

It is up to you to plan your flight route by setting waypoints on the tactical map prior to take-off; you can also (but need not) select the armament of your plane. When you have accumulated enough flight experience, you may command entire squadrons in the fictional Operation Conquest campaign, a simple simulation of an entire war theater that already hinted at what would later become DIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Virtual Battlefield.

Dodge between radars, sneak under enemy fighters, and take out your primary objectives and secondary objectives with your limited weapons onboard, then make your way home. Can you survive all the way to general and win the Congressional Medal of Honor?

F-19 Stealth Fighter was based around Sid Meier's closest estimate of the stealth fighter based on the data available at the time. You get full 3D graphics, 3D enemies, random objectives and enemy dispositions (so each mission will be different), dynamic radar effectiveness that depends on your position and radar cross section, enemies that search you out if you do "tickle" their defenses, even civilian aircrafts in the air, and ability to play in cold war, moderate war, or all-out war, with very different rules of engagement.</desc>

		<desc>F1 is an Official Formula One Racing Game. There are two modes of play available: "Arcade", "Grand Prix". In both of these modes you complete a certain number of laps (4, 8, or 12) and select which circuit that you want to race on. The circuits include San Marino, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Japan, and Australia. Some circuits are easy, while some are difficult. 

There are slight differences between the two modes. For instance, "Arcade" allows you to select the circuit in any order that you like, whereas "Grand Prix" only allows you to fine-tune your car before starting a race. You also need to race a circuit in the order that they appear on the circuit selection screen, but you can skip a track if you want. 

F1 is a 1-2 player game, meaning that if you have another player handy, you can compete against each other.</desc>

This is made a little easier by the fact that your turbocharged Ferrari F40 can do over 300 MPH.

There are many forks in the road, with arrows at the top of the screen indicating which route is quicker. Any high-speed contact causes the car to blow up, but you have an infinite supply of these, and the only real penalty is the lost time. There are lots of road blocks to swerve around.

He had been the best! The trains on his patrol had been free from crime. He had seen to that. But the death of his 'Green Beret' brother from a drug overdose sent him over the edge. Seeking vengeance he hounded drug dealers and showed no mercy when he caught them. He became known as a Renegade,  the FALLEN ANGEL.

Wearing his brother's beret as a tribute, he was a familiar sight on the New York subway network. A men to be avoided at all costs. Then came a break. By chance he uncovered an international drugs ring which was using the subway systems of major cities as a distribution network. The destruction of these people became his only goal.

Traveling from country to country to seek out then eradicate the local chapters of every drug ring became his deadly mission. He became the Judge, the Jury and the executioner, an Angel of Death. FALLEN ANGEL is a fantastic scrolling arcade-action game spread across three major city rail networks. Beat your way up and down the trains and platforms of the London Tube, Paris Metro and New York Subway systems.

Find and destroy the local drug dealers and their henchmen. But beware! Your adversaries are not just highly trained thugs, but often crafted drug fiends, oblivious to pain.</desc>

The most technically-advanced of Dizzy's adventure games in many ways, it was the only one to feature actual scrolling rather than a flick-screen system, the only one not to be released for the 8 bit computers the character originated on, the only one to originate on a console, as well as featuring many mini-games, such as Bubble Dizzy and an Operation Wolf clone.

Gameplay involves walking Dizzy through the levels, picking up objects and using them to solve simple puzzles. There are plenty of tests of arcade skill along the way as well, as gaps must be jumped and baddies avoided - starting with a limited number of lives, the player can earn more by completing Theodore's puzzle. Before rescuing Daisy the player must capture all stars that unlock the gates of the tower.</desc>

Reputedly one of the greatest rivalries since the invention of the basketball itself, the Slammers and the Jammers are at it again. This time itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s two teams of six taking part in a three-on-three contest.

You compete with a friend or a computer opponent, and before the match starts a few tactical decisions have to be made: the length of the quarters (3 to 12 minutes) and exactly which members of the squad are going to play. A quick resume of each playerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strengths and weaknesses helps you decide.

The court is viewed as two awkward flick-screen halves. As a result any action in the centre of the court inevitably becomes confused. Ball moves include dribbling, passing, shooting and opportunities for calling offensive and defensive plays. There are two kinds of personal foul and no free throws. Unusually, you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t automatically control the player nearest the ball; switching between players manually tends to slow the action down.

On paper it all sounds pretty sophisticated. On court, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a disappointment. The sprites are poorly defined and jerkily animated, playÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spoilt by the flick-screen action and there isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t that much skill required. It only takes a couple of minutes to get used to the shooting controls and after that almost every basket you attempt goes in.

If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve always dreamed of hurling yourself up the court in a pair of Lycra shorts, dribble driving, no-look passing and slam-dunking your way into basketball history, keep on dreaming. Accolade has built up a reputation for producing top class sports Sims. This isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t one of them.</desc>

		<name>Fast Lane</name>
		<desc>Fast Lane! is a racing game, simulating the C-1 championship. It has nine tracks, including Horama, Le Mans, Suzuka and Donnington. There is a practice mode in which you can get used to the gears, which can also be set to auto transmission. Many options on the car can be tweaked, for example the angle of the front and rear spoilers, the tires and more. A detailed damage model can be shown and also fuel settings can be changed (you can reduce the amount of fuel in the tank).

Before a race you have to qualify by getting a good time during three rounds on the empty racing track. Depending on the qualifying time you start in the field. The graphics are displayed with zooming sprites, and the track is not flat, but features some hills that limit the view of the further road. Despite the car options, this game is not a real simulation but plays like an arcade racer.</desc>

		<desc>Fate: Gates of Dawn is a first-person role-playing game with turn-based combat, similar in visual style and gameplay to Wizardry and Bard's Tale games. The player can recruit up to 28 characters, resulting in four parties that can be controlled separately. A notable feature of the game is a day/night cycle with weather effects that influence the behavior of the world's inhabitants. For example, less creatures will venture outside if it is raining; the player can choose to cast the Rain spell to reduce the number of hostile encounters.

There is a total of 32 different character classes in the game; many of them are traditional (like Wizard or Cleric), but there are also many exotic ones, such as for example Nymph, Banshee, Valkyrie, and others. Each class has abilities and spells associated with it. The world of the game is inhabited by eleven races, each with its own background history.</desc>

		<desc>One night, when Roy Fat was home, thugs from the evil Thindicate corporation kidnap Roy's old lady while she watches television, and the only way that Roy is going to get her back is to trade her for the Duplicator, and the complete documentation that came with it.

There are seven stages to the game, and there are three levels each in the first stage, only two in the rest. The object of the game is to eat all the food that there is in the level. Once all food is eaten by Roy, a tone will sound, meaning that the gate that leads Roy into the next level will be open. Stopping him from doing this is insects and other wildlife, including rats, birds, bats, and many more. Roy is able to fix this, however, by using a variety of weapons like his foot, his fat tummy, carrots, mushroom bombs, and my personal favorite, his burp. He can also jump in the air and land on his ass to get rid of enemies.

If he touches an enemy, he loses one of his lives. If he loses all his lives, the game is over. Once Roy has collected all the food in a stage, he has to face a boss that is usually much bigger than him. Fatman can also pass flags, which lets him continue where he left off if he loses a life. Besides enemies, other hazards need to be looked out for, including spike, spikeballs, water, and fire.</desc>

The game is played across 30 levels., with a level designer also included. The one-player game has 3 difficulty levels, while multi-player action is available via a null-modem cable.</desc>

There is a significant amount of playable options in FOFT and a considerable attention is paid to detail. For instance, if the player becomes tired of roaming through outer space they skim a planet or two (which plays in a similar fashion to David Braben's other game, Virus).

During the docking sequence players can create their own programs for automated functions, using a built-in BASIC like language called SIMPLE.</desc>

Fundamentally this is a Commando clone, scrolling vertically and with hordes of enemies to be taken on, with finding good shielding spots and launching surprise attacks an especially useful strategy.You have unlimited bullets and limited but collectible grenades to use. There are landmines to avoid, and medical packs to pick up.

On each of the 8 levels you must destroy Fernandez's buildings, which are accessed through an underground network of tunnels. You're not limited to being on foot - you start off in a jeep and can also use motorbikes, tanks and similar, although losing a life destroys this. In 2-player mode you can split driving and gunning duties. When starting a new game, you always start from the point at which you died in the last game.</desc>

You job does not start at the racetrack; perfecting the car at the Maranello factory, in the wind tunnel to sort aerodynamics, and at the test track of Fiorano, is all required to get the most competitive car you can.

You can jump straight into the races however, either as one-offs or a full championship season. Races can last from 18km to the full 300+km distance, with all the practice and qualifying sessions. Car setup at the track involves selecting wing settings, tyre compounds, fuel usage (important in the days of turbocharged engines) and the like. The action is viewed from inside the cockpit, with rear-view mirrors to help prevent collisions.</desc>

		<name>FIFA International Soccer</name>
		<desc>The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football's world governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as "isometric") viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.

Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</desc>

		<desc>Fighting Soccer is a coin-op conversion and like its arcade counterpart the action is viewed from above and the screen scrolls to keep the ball central. You have a team of five players of which you control the one nearest to the ball. The idea of the game is to win an Olympic Gold Medal by beating your opponents in a knock-out tournament. You can use all the normal football skills: dribbling, shooting and heading but what makes Fighting Soccer different is that you can also foul your opponents. If you decide that an Olympic medal is worth a bit of foul play then you'd better watch out for the ever vigilant referee.

Because of the difficulty factor many people will give up after a few plays, real soccer fans with lots of perseverance may get some enjoyment from Fighting Soccer but I think that the repetitive nature of the game may even get to them after a while. If Activision hoped to net a winner with Fighting Soccer then this effort is well wide of the posts.</desc>

Now he has returned, captured the party and threw them in his dungeon. The player takes the role of one of the group, with the goal to free his comrades, explore the island and stop the threat once and for all.

The main difference to the predecessor is the isometric perspective and a completely icon-driven interface. To interact with the environment, first a click on the con and then on the item or person in the playfield is necessary. The puzzles are inventory-based, but the environment plays a big role in the problems and their solutions: the game features a day/night-cycle and a weather system. The people to be freed have different abilities which need to be used for puzzle solving. Despite the perspective, the current group leader is not on screen and the player is meant to see through his/her eyes.</desc>

		<name>Final Blow</name>
		<desc>Final Blow is a Sports game, developed by Taito Corporation and published by Storm, which was released in Europe in 1991.

Up until now, the only semi-decent boxing sim has been the humble Spectrum version of EliteÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Frank Bruno game. However, in converting Final Blow, Storm have taken the risk and, to an extent, pulled it off.  Somehow, though, Storm have managed to inject a modicum of playability into the Amiga game, creating a repetitive but playable conversion.

The original coin-op sported five boxers, each of whom had to be beaten before the title was yours. StormÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s game, however, now sports a tournament, a two-player mode and an expanded gym of ten would-be champs. The actual bouts against these guys takes place over two rounds within a horizontally-scrolling ring, with the playerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on-screen persona represented by one of the largest sprites the Amiga has housed.

There are a variety of punches available, ranging from uppercuts to head blows and blocks, and these are all easily accessed using the joystick and fire button. In addition, if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re coming off worse during a scuffle, the ref will come in and break you up or you can leap out of the fray.

WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s there is well done, however, somehow I get the feeling that, even if Storm had added more moves to the existing ones, the game would still boil down to the same thing. Entertaining enough in the short-term, and undoubtedly better than the coin-op. Final Blow is the best of its kind but a feather-weight in the lasting appeal department.</desc>

		<name>Final Countdown</name>
		<desc>In Final Countdown the player takes the role of Laira Tyrik who is the commander of a space station. However, she is near an mysterious asteroid which threatens to destroy Earth. So she goes out to investigate and she finds an apparently deserted space station. She has to investigate all floors to be able to save Earth.

The main challenge of the game is to find a way through the maze-like corridors of each floor. Laira can either walk or use her jet pack for vertical movement which takes fuel. She also needs to watch our for obstacles like electrified bars which block certain passages and droids which are best avoided because of they see Laira, the time limit is shortened or they try to kill her. She has no weapons except for mines which have to be found on the station: laying the on the ground causes everyone to die who walks over them (including Laira). There are also other pieces of equipment to find, e.g. extra fuel.

Laira also often has to operate computer terminals to gain information and open closed passages, e.g. by opening doors, activating elevators or deactivating traps. While most of the game is shown from the side, the game switches to a first-person view and player has to type in commands to interact with the terminal; similar to using DOS. The terminal understands 13 commands which are explained in the manual. Mistakes in operating the system may result in an alarm and therefore a time penalty.</desc>

		<desc>John Torofex, security consultant for the International Peace Conference in Megapolis has been tipped off that a group of ruthless mercenaries are on their way to the centre of the city intent wreaking havoc and murdering the conference delegates. Your help Is required - pronto!

The villains must be stopped on the roads before they get to the conference centre. Luckily youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve just had the Thunder Master II serviced, so youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re ready tor action. Obviously, coming from behind, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll meet the mercenary minions first. Get rid of these as soon as possible as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the head of the convoy that you really want. The onslaught is made up of five convoys,  killing one leader will transfer you onto another street with another set of vehicles. As you make your way through the convoy, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll encounter many types of enemy vehicles, from Jeeps to tanks, and every one must be dispatched. Most can be cleared using your normal blasters, but some particularly tough ones will need a missile up the rear if theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re to make way. The all-important commodity of fuel can be picked up along the way, as can any extra missiles, lives and kerosene cans (for flight) which you may like to chuck in the boot.

Graphics is not very convincing 3D perspective with smooth scrolling landscapes and reasonable sprite animation. Pity thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no option to turn the naff background music off but there are suitable crunching effects with a few screeching sounds.

Fire And Forget II: The Death Convoy is simplistic fun that wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hold the playerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s attention tor very long. If you like a pick-up-and-play blaster, this is just the job.</desc>

The aliens will destroy vital part of the station and the droids need to repair them. There are also other important tasks like getting repairing equipment out of lockers or refueling. The player does not control the droid directly, but programs a script which is then performed independently. If the droid is interrupted, they stop the program and don't fight back. It has to be manually restarted by the player. To be more effective, the droid can be split into three droids with different abilities which have to be programmed individually. The game ends when all droids are disabled by the aliens, but if only one or two are down they can be repaired. There are four decks which can be reached through teleports.</desc>

With your martial art skills, your enemy best beware with those sudden moves that may prove fatal!

The First Samurai offers a wide array of weapons, special items and other objects. Combat is usually melee, either relying on your punch or kicks or using the magical sword to slash some pretty skillful blows in whatever direction possible.

Two distinct sets of 5-a-side rules are featured, English and International, with full explanations of the differences built into the game. There are seven different pitch surfaces, ranging form grass and Astroturf to concrete and plastic, as well as the option of playing without a fence keeping the ball constantly in play.

		<desc>Rescuing girlfriends is a pretty common challenge in older computer games - why can't any of these ladies look after themselves? On this occasion Pearly has been kidnapped by Fransz Dandruff, so you'd better make sure he's hair today, gone tomorrow.

The gameplay is platform based, although you can move down platforms as well as up to the next one. There are lots of baddies (drawn in a cutesy style) who need shooting and offer rewards. the 7 levels are fairly short, relatively easy, and linear.</desc>

		<name>Flintstones, The</name>
		<desc>The Flintstones is a game based on the popular cartoon series The Flintstones by Hanna-Barbera Productions Inc.

It's weekend! Fred Flintstone thinks of only one thing: bowling  
with his friend and neighbor Barney.
Unfortunately, his wife Wilma got other plans for him. Fred has to paint the living room and Wilma is not going to help him with it. No, she goes shopping.
And if that's not enough, Wilma also tells Fred that his mother-in-law is coming over.

The Flintstones game is divided in four parts.

Part 1: Painting the walls of your living room.
To go to the bowling alley before it is closed Fred has to paint  the walls as quickly as possible. To paint the walls Fred uses the tail of a living squirrel. 
Pebbles tries to leap out her playpen and starts crawling around and starts scribbling on the walls. If Fred wants to put Pebbles back in the playpen then he has to drop the squirrel, that immediately starts wandering off. When Pebbles is back in the playpen Fred has to chase the squirrel and dip its tail in the paint again.

Part 2: Driving your car on the way to the bowling center.
Finally, when all walls are painted Fred can go to the bowling  
alley!
Fred has to drive to the bowling alley but unfortunately the roads are in a very bad condition. The road surface is dire and covered with rocks!
And if one of the wheels hit a bump it will break off the car and disappear into the distance.

Part 3: A bowling competition between Fred and Barney.
At the bowling alley the following bowling parameters can be set: the spin and speed of the ball and the starting position of the player.
Each turn gives two throws (except he gets a strike). A game  
takes ten turns. while a match takes three games.

Part 4: Saving Pebbles at a construction site.
On his way home Fred discovers that Pebbles has disappeared!  Don't let Wilma find that out!
Fred finds Pebbles at a construction site on top of some  
scaffolding. He has to climb the scaffolding to rescue her.
If Fred fails to rescue his daughter then Barney rescues her and Fred will be branded as a failure!</desc>

		<name>Flip-it &amp; Magnose - Water Carriers from Mars</name>
		<desc>Flip-it &amp; Magnose, the title characters of this action game with strong puzzle elements, live on Mars. Unfortunately the planet has not exactly the biggest water resources of the universe and so they are sent to Earth to get some. In the vertically scrolling platform levels the player has to solve puzzles by collecting objects and using them at the right place respectively giving them to the right people. However, the water is not given directly, but there is a water drop which has to be caught by using the water catcher object. The goal of each level is to collect a certain amount of water within the time limit.

The player character can't die, but loses fruit when he falls too much of a distance. Fruit can be collected when wandering through the levels and are used between the six levels to buy traps which have different effects (and of course different prices), e.g. wasting a bit of time or reversing the controls. This is useful because the two Martians don't work together and try to beat each other's water score. There are also other items to collect which are not directly related to puzzle solving, like a spring for long jumps and objects which help against special hazards in the level. Collecting pills is a bit of a gamble because they can either add or subtract points on the water or fruit counter. The game uses a split-screen; one half for each Martian. In two-player games, the second Martian is controlled by player two.</desc>

		<name>Flood</name>
		<desc>Quiffy must collect all of the various pieces of litter on the level and then find the exit to complete each level. In general the litter is not particularly hidden, it is just distributed around the level. Quiffy can climb on most walls and ceilings, and swim through water. He has energy which depletes upon touching dangerous objects, but can also die instantly when touching any of the few lethal objects. Although he can swim and has the appearance of an amphibious life-form, he can only breathe above water and will start to drown if he runs out of air.

In each level, you are followed by the ghost of your Aunt Matilda. She copies your movements exactly and starts off about 15 seconds behind you. However, she is very slightly faster than you and will eventually catch up with you. Touching the ghost will hurt Quiffy.

Most of the levels have taps in them, which pour water in to the level. The modelling of the water was quite advanced for a home computer game of its time; the water will flow to the lowest point that it can and when multiple taps are pouring water in one place, it will fill up proportionally fast. A lot of levels feature taps in all areas so the entire level will eventually flood, leaving Quiffy with no available source of air. This aspect is how the game derives its title.</desc>

		<name>Floor 13</name>
		<desc>Somewhere in London is a secret organization that is based on the 13th floor of an office building. The sole purpose for this organizationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s existence is to keep the current British government in power at any cost - specifically, that means helping the current Prime Minister keep ahead of his competition in the polls.

Floor 13 is a management simulation controlled by a menu-based system (similar to Darklands) and is presented in black and white for a film noir feel. Players take the role of the Director General in this secret organization, and are given a target date of 20 days to attend to their duties. During this period, performance will be evaluated based on the Prime Minister's polling results. If the PM is doing well, the agency will be expanded and will have more equipment and services available to handle the situations it will encounter later in the game. If the PM is behind, Floor 13 risks reduction in the number of services it has available or even the player's continued employment. After each successful 20 day period, another 20 days are added to the calendar, full of new problems and objectives.

During the time between target dates, players will have to deal with various problems, both externally and internally. Some examples include: saving the son of the U.S. President from terrorists, breaking up a drug ring controlled by a VIP recently honored by the Queen, or even prevent a scientist in the British space agency from publicly stating that their latest achievement has been a total sham (shades of the film "Capricorn One"). While you are completing these tasks there is another secret society that will pressure you to have its goals completed, and this may very well interfere with the missions officially assigned to Floor 13.

The Floor 13 organization is not a benevolent one and players will need to do some rather unpleasant things to ensure that the democratic machine runs smoothly. Examples of activities include: searching and looting peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s homes, calling in commando units for heavy assault purposes, wire-tapping and trailing people without bothering to go through legal channels, discrediting notable people through the media and infiltrating established organizations. At times, you might even need to detain citizens and torture them (the torture bits can get rather graphic at times, though it's doled out through a text report), or even assassinate troublesome proles (one of the few political policy games, along with Shado</desc>

		<desc>Your homeland's precious limited energy is being taken advantage of by the evil Thargoid Empire, and you and your spaceship must do something about it. There are 8 bases to enter, with the aim of using energy pods to cause the reactors to overload and thus malfunction.

The game is viewed side-on, resembling the ST classic Oids quite strongly; which is to say that gravity and motion physics dictate the ship's motion strongly. The 8 levels all have plenty of enemies on offer, both wall-mountings and actual ships, as well as enhanced weapons and extra fuel and shield energy. The ship can take some damage, and repairs itself over time (for no logical reason), which is one of the few things that gives you a hope of getting anywhere early on. Losing a life causes all the enemy turrets to replenish, emphasizing the restart points and making things more maze-based and methodical.</desc>

		<desc>Fed up with football (soccer) management games, with all the match strategies, financial turmoil and prima donna players? This game offers a unique twist, leaving you 'managing' the career of a single player, involving matches and transfers.

You start with 10 'goal cards' - up to 3 can be played in each match, each of them giving you a shooting chance, at which point arcade action skill comes in. The better you perform, the higher your wages are, the more chance you have of a big-money transfer and international call-up, and the less chance you have of being dropped from the team.

There's also a trivia section, which asks increasingly difficult questions allowing you to go double or nothing on knowing the answers - up to £8000 a time can be won on this.</desc>

		<name>Football Glory</name>
		<desc>Football Glory is a Sports game, developed by Croteam and published by Black Legend, which was released in Europe in 1994.

Football Glory is yet another average kickabout-in-the-park when compared to the Wembley Stadium of Sensible Soccer, but is no threat to serious threat to Sensi in the final reckoning. Overall, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a bad game - trivial (but annoying) faults aside. There are plenty of options you can mess around with, competitions to enter your team in, and creating your own leagues and cups is always fun. And if you can persuade a mate or six to join you will find yourself playing along quite happily. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just that when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been playing Sensible World of Soccer all month, this along with almost every other football game, pales in comparison.

It plays an okay game of football, and I do like the overhead kick ability because it works very well. The speech, even it there is only one example of it is good as well. On the other hand, the aftertouch is absurd, the computer opponents can vary from stupid to world class during the same game and the special moves donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t ready work (mostly because you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the chance to try for them before you lose possession of the ball).

Ah, well, never mind eh? A nice try, but in the end it just doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the right combination of options, new features or gameplay that it really should have to be number one.</desc>

Simulmondo was running warm-up laps with Formula 1: They promise fast 3D action with variable detail, giving players the choice of true speed or high realism but at the end this was a wasted opportunity from Simulmondo to make a good racing simulation game. They mixed some arcade elements (timer, few laps, easy handling, no damage) with a bit of simulation. Unfortunately, the mix didn't get well and the result was a dull game (considering also that there was just only one circuit). On the other hand, the downs become up when played hotseat with a friend. Play it with some friends and game is really enjoyable.</desc>

		<name>Frankenstein</name>
		<desc>Baron Frankenstein has instructed his hunchback servant Egor to collect tools and bodies for him to use in his quest to create artificial life. As Egor, the player must search through Frankenstein's castle, the dungeons, the surrounding forest, the local village and other areas in this side-scrolling platformer. Despite the grim themes, the game is a humorous cartoonish one. Each task begins in Frankenstein's lab with the Baron telling Egor what item he requires. Egor must find it, put it in his sack and return to the lab to receive the next task. Along the way there are enemies such as ghosts, skeletons, rats, bats, animated body parts, local townsfolk and others. Instead of a health bar, Egor has a Frightometer with a range from calm to panic. Touching enemies moves it ever more towards the maximum. Once that is reached, Egor will drop what he is carrying, flee to the lab and in so doing lose a life. There is a way of reducing the meter, though: meeting up with the local serving wench will calm Egor's nerves and return it to zero. It is also reset when an item has been delivered. Once Egor has found and returned the weather chart requested by Frankenstein, the game introduces a time limit. The timer starts at around 74 minutes and counts down to the electrical storm that will bring the monster to life. Failing to collect all required items within the limit means the end of the game.</desc>

		<name>Frantic Freddie</name>
		<desc>From the people who brought you that excellent version of Donkey Kong a couple of months back comes Frantic Freddie, yet another platform game. If anything (and some may find this hard to believe) it's even simpler than Kong. Hero Freddie has to be maneuvered around the network of platforms and ladders whilst picking up the goodies and avoiding the roving nasties. Not so bad, eh? Ah, but the twist here is that Freddie can't walk through the ladders, so if he's not careful it's very easy for him to get trapped in a dead-end. However, that aside, that's pretty much all there is to say. It's simple, enjoyable and very fast paced. However, it can get a bit frustrating simply due to the ease with which you can get caught by the ghoulies. (Ahem!) All-in-all, Frantic Freddie's unlikely to keep you glued to your monitor all night long, but it's the sort of game you're likely to load up from time to time just for a quick go.</desc>

		<name>Freak Out</name>
		<desc>Freak Out is a fast-paced strategy game where each level takes the player to a different location, to contain the attack of the fuzzy intruders. The playing field consists of interconnected cells, arranged in concentric squares. The Freaks (which come in four different colors) pop out of a hatch at the center, and can be moved about by rotating and smacking them, which sends them jumping to the next cell (if it isn't occupied). To score points and eliminate Freaks, three of the same color must be placed in adjacent cells, making them vanish in a puff of smoke. Speed is essential, since the quickly-reproducing aliens line up behind the hatch: if you let the queue get too long, it's game over. Random items and obstacles pop up occasionally, like bonus gems, freezing ice, stone walls, or colored circles (which can only be occupied by a Freak of the same hue). As the game advances, new challenges and mini-puzzles appear, which force the player to respond before more Freaks can be eliminated. A password records the player's progress after every level.</desc>

		<path>./Freedom_v1.0.lha</path>
		<name>Freedom : Rebels in the Darkness</name>
		<desc>Freedom: Rebels In The Darkness is a game that combines elements of strategy, stealth and fighting games. The main character is a rebellious black slave working on a sugar plantation that tries to incite a revolt among the slave population to gain freedom and to give comeuppance to each of their old masters.

At the start of the game there is four characters to choose, each with different statistics and abilities like "constitution" and "lock-picking". The main game screen is a map of the plantation, where you guide a small icon of the character while trying to avoid the guard dogs. If the dogs find you, they either bark and alert the owners or attack you. When they do, the screen switches to a first-person screen where you have to avoid being bitten and killed by the animal.

On the top of the screen there are four buttons, each with a unique function:
Path-finding lets you click on the map with a cursor and see a description of each hut and house.
Movement allows you to move your character. Left-clicking shows a first-person view of your surroundings. This screen can vary depending of the place where you are in the map. Most of the time is the recruitment screen, where you click on your brother slaves to amass a army. Their response is a random "yes" or "no". If you click while on a sugar field, you get the option of climbing the huts, picking the storage hut lock, or setting fire to the premises. If you click while on the housings of the owner or one of his henchmen, you get the option of either confronting the person, or running away. If you decide to confront him, the screen switches to a side-view similar to fighting games like Street Fighter, with two energy bars at the bottom, where you have to fight one of the owner's men. If you win, you have the choice of killing the person or holding him captive.
Review is the game statistics screen, where you can see your progress in the game.
Advice only starts working once you get the support of either the shaman or the medicine man. They can heal any wound sustained by dog attacks and fights.
The game accepts mouse, keyboard and joystick controls, and plays drum music and other sounds.</desc>

		<desc>Frenetic is a traditional vertically scrolling shoot'em'up. The action moves through eight levels, set both in space and on the ground (with such environments as a jungle planet and a water world). While most levels have a technological theme, some feature organic enemies and backgrounds, reminiscent of games like R-Type or Xenon 2. Going with tradition, each level has a huge end boss.

The player's ship can collect a variety of power-ups: lasers and missiles, shooting to the front, the back or the sides. Speed-ups and shields are also available. Power-ups are revealed by destroying certain enemies or special bonus capsules, and several are given to the player for free at the start of a level. The weapons can be upgraded by collecting the same power-up several times.

The game features a two-player mode, with two ships moving against the aliens at the same time.</desc>

You prowl the rooms of the mansion searching for victims. You have to dodge the Crucifixes thrown at you and sink your teeth into anything that looks tasty. Once you've drained the blood of all your victims, you can proceed to the next level. Keep an eye out for the unhealthy as they will drain your lifeforce; too much bad blood and you're a dead vampire. You can run back to your coffin if you're low on health to regenerate, as well, you must be back in your coffin before the sun comes up, or you're a toasty vampire.</desc>

Cosmica is full of hideous monsters, many of which can be shot. Your character builds momentum as it moves, so some hazards are easier to clear from a running start. You can only jump vertically, although you have control as the character falls. Ammunition is limited, and must be collected throughout your quest.

Three sweets which enhance your character can be collected - the red one increases your speed, blue increases the height of your leap, and green means you can safely fall further. There are additional objects to pick up and use as well.</desc>

		<desc>Full Metal Planète is a tie-in of a board game of the same name. Up to four players land on a planet with their motherships, trying to gather as much ore as possible within 24 game rounds.

This almost sounds like a happy, idyllic round of pick-the-flowers, if it weren't for the truckload of tanks and destroyers that each players happens to have in the cargo area of his mothership. So the players usually spend an equal amount of time picking up ore and bashing their contenders' heads in.

The computer game is an accurate conversion of the board game; virtually every feature is present. Strategy is needed to succeed in the game. The only semi-random thing are the tides (high tide, low tide, and something in-between) which can strand boats and engulf tanks, but even they can be partially predicted.</desc>

The difference is that physical contact of a fairly violent nature is allowed, and the court is littered with mines and bombs to wound the players. Shooting involves holding down fire to get the height right, so avoid being tackled as you prepare your shot. Other basketball rules such as double-dribbling and the 25-second hand-over are unsurprisingly waived. A 3-division league is included to progress through.</desc>

Killed enemies leave behind money which can be reinvested into vehicle upgrades between levels. A life is lost when the energy bar is completely drained, so it is advised to dodge obstacles and vehicles. Movement is restricted to left and right; the speed can't be regulated.</desc>

		<desc>When it comes to producing the fabled Ã¢â‚¬ËœInteractive MovieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, all credit has so far gone to Cinemaware. On the other hand, American software house Sierra have been beavering away on their own style of interactive movies. Future Wars takes off from where Sierra apparently stopped. It is almost second generation in much the same vein.

You start off as a low window cleaner high up on the outside of a sky scraper. The introductory sequence shows him accidentally knocking his bucket over and taking a rollicking from his boss. Half-closing the window behind him the boss disappears back into the seclusion of his office, leaving you to ponder your next move. All the in-game orders are issued through a menu of just five commands to move the main character. Quite basic, but all the objects and puzzles are designed around that method making the game smoother to play.

There is a plot. The Earth has been under attack for many years now, but thanks to the SDI system sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s held her own against the aliens. Two scientists discover that the aliens have gone back in time and landed in the year 1304. What this has to do with you is not made clear, so it leaves plenty of room for discovery.

Future Wars has some excellent animated sequences, gorgeous backdrops and a multitude of problems and characters to face. All backed up with sampled sound effects and the simple control method. A perfect game for the long winter months.</desc>

The old wizard gets a little upset, and orders the apprentice to get rid of the fuzzballs swarming all over his castle. If he succeeds, the wizard will turn him back to human form again.

This is a platform game, with 50 levels. To complete each level, you'll have to collect all the treasures, while at the same time avoiding, or killing, various enemies. You will face mostly other fuzzballs, but also other creatures. Each level is only a single Bubble Bobblish screen, but can take a while to complete anyway.

Touching an enemy once means instant death, and if you don't complete a level in time, you will be killed by mosquitoes entering the screen. To succeed in Fuzzball, you'll have to plan every move carefully, otherwise you'll die very quickly.</desc>

This is a quite simple platformer which starts with a rather steep learning curve. The game is a mix of two genres: an ordinary platformer, combined with a quiz game, asking single-choice questions from the player (three choices in total). Short instructions: Find the crystal and return it back to the time machine. You cannot free the crystal until you have answered ALL questions correctly. H - pause game U - use item (remote control, gun, mirror, monkey-wrench, mask, moonhopper) Pull down the joystick to pick up the bodies of nasties you previously paralyzed by jumping upon. Pressing FIRE will "dispose" them eventually. (NOTE: you must have your hands free to pick up anything, i. e. if you're holding an item, you will have to put it away first)

Later levels are linear, better graphics, quite good and good controls spoiled by inertia.</desc>

		<desc>As rebel forces close in on the space station Gallion, you launch strikes against enemy-controlled planets in the most sophisticated techno-toy available to mankind, the space fighter Thunder Cloud II. 

The game is a blend of action sequences in an Afterburner-esque pseudo-3D view. These sequences vary between ground combat, aerial combat and space combat, with different motion physics and enemy craft. There is also a strategic battle choices on a galactic map invaded in real-time.

The PC version uses speaker tweaks to recreate the game's tune on theoretically-inferior hardware.</desc>

		<desc>Einstein, Newton and Darwin are the Galactic Warrior Rats, mutant hybrids who come under your control in this top-down multi-directional shooter. Their plan is to save the badly polluted planet Smeaton Five by destroying its robotic defences and the computer primed to explode it. 

Many enemies must be shot down along the way, but most release credits when shot Ã¢â‚¬â€œ wait a few seconds for these to appear. You have three lives, with each rat representing a life, which means that all upgrades are lost when you lose a life, and each ratÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s protective biosphere has the ability to withstand a few shots. Before heading into the action, you can spend your initial 500 credits on upgrades and weaponry. Your movement features a degree of inertia, making it harder to stop short of a position.</desc>

		<name>Galaxy '89</name>
		<desc>Galaxy 89 is a Galaga clone. The player controls a spaceship that can only move left and right at the bottom of the screen. The aim of the game is to destroy as many enemy waves as possible without losing all of the extra lives. Pressing the fire button fires a shot at the enemy attack waves, which enter the screen from different edges. The only other movement possible for the player is a diagonal shot, by moving the controller in the opposite direction they want to fire. The game gets gradually harder with waves appearing behind the player or large amounts of enemy shots the player has to avoid. Having its roots in an arcade game, the objective of Galaxy 89 is to gain the highest possible score. Destroying waves of enemies gives the player points, as well as the bonus rounds considering mostly of cannon fodder-type enemies that occur after clearing a certain number of waves.</desc>

The game also features a multiple player option, this makes it a nice party game. If you are alone, you can compete against the computer.

If you're stuck in an event, or want to get better, just take the coaching book (= the manual) and read how you can make more tricks. It also features many real facts of the history of the Olympic summer games.</desc>

		<path>./Ganymed_v1.1.lha</path>
		<name>Ganymed</name>
		<desc>Ganymed is a Shooter game, developed by Euroline and published by ReadySoft, which was released in Europe in 1988.

My heart sank when I saw the cover of this game... not another Empire Strikes Back ripoff. Jeff Minter made a fortune out of a game called Attack of the Mutant Camels on the C64, and that was about a million times better as a game than this rather turgid attempt to rekindle an ancient idea. Sure, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been written for the American market, and perhaps they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mind this sort of rubbish, but in this country, the competition is a little stiffer.

The screen is divided into thirds for the action, the scanner and the score. You fly your ship in a Defender style fashion from the right to the left and back again, trying to destroy the big walkers as they lumber from left to the right. 

The game is fast, to be sure, but with no real control over whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happening to your ship, if you take off too slowly you get shot; fly faster and you get out of control and crash into one of the Deathbots.
The sounds are depressingly similar to the sound effects from the Star Wars games, although nicely synthesised rather than sampled. The sound you get outside the action is a little bit boring, being just a synthesised throb. The graphics are nice enough, but somehow a little bit wooden, what I would call 8 bitty.

Ganymed is derivative, and frankly a bit of a letdown compared to other games of itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s type. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m reminded of FirebirdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Return to Genesis, which although in a similar price range is a much more enjoyable game, being better thought out and well presented.

Cheats:
During play push the joystick to turn your ship around and quickly press 'SPACE'. You must press 'SPACE' before your ship turns completely around. Now press '.' on the numeric keypad. This will give you a free life. This only works once per level.</desc>

		<name>Garfield : Winter's Tail</name>
		<desc>Take a rotund, ginger tomcat. Give him an insatiable appetite for lasagne. And leave the fridge door open. What do you get? The sequel to Big, Fat, Hairy Deal, that's what.

Winter's Tail is a three-part program, with the option of playing each section in whichever order you desire. Part One rests your paws at the top of a steep ski slope. The next load contains two separate levels, the first of which is more akin to a bonus stage, where you must waggle the joystick at great speed to scoff as much lasagne as possible. The second part moves you over into the Chocolate Factory. Achieve success in this section and you are whisked off to the final load. It's Torville and Dean time as you skate around an iced-over lake in pursuit of an escaped Chocolate Chicken.

Winter's Tail does have its drawbacks, however. The sprites, although large, colourful and immediately recognisable, tend to move too slowly, especially on the skiing level where a hasty slide to the left or right is essential in avoiding some of the obstacles (I also noticed that collision detection was somewhat suspect on this level, too). Still, Winter's Tail deserves to do well, being an instantly playable, enjoyable tie-in of everyone's favourite moggy.</desc>

		<desc>Garfield hates Mondays. It's Monday today and that means that something bad is bound to happen. A howled message from another member of the local cat community floats in through the window: 'Garfield! Arlene's been taken to the city pound!'

Monday strikes again! 'Ho-hum,' thinks Garfield, 'I suppose I'd better go to the rescue.' So, summoning up all his (meagre) strength, he sets off to find a way to get his girlfriend released.



On the way, there are a number of 'puzzles' that he needs to complete, starting with how to get Odie to follow him and open the door, allowing him to get out to the rest of the town and continue his quest. His journey will take him through all sorts of locations, including the park, sewers, shops and finally the city pound. And when he's has freed Arlene, he can live lazily ever after.



You might not find the arcade puzzles all that satisfying but just for the pleasure of starring in your own cartoon it's got to be worth a second look.</desc>

		<desc>Gary Lineker's Hot-Shot! (Also known as Litti's Hot-Shot!) is a soccer game in which two teams try to win the match. The adjustable options are the number of players, the time of a half time and the AI level. The game is played in a top-down view and only shows a part of the playfield.

The player either controls the athlete in ball possession or, when in defense, the one which is nearest. When shooting, the power of the shot depends on how long the button was pressed and the direction changes with the joystick movement, e.g. moving against the walking direction results in a overhead kick.

		<desc>Gauntlet III is an action-based dungeon exploration game. Like in the predecessors you empty areas infested by all kinds of enemies while running for the exit. Like this was rather a straight forward thing in the first two games, it's not that easy to finish a level anymore. While you only had to run until you find the exit (and besides killing hordes of enemies you probably find some keys to unlock doors leading to deeper dungeons) you might have to solve a few "quests" to proceed to the next level in this installment. These "quests" are very basic, for example you have to find object A, then bring it to B, advance to C and finally go to D to uncover the exit.

While the first two games had a top-down view, Gauntlet 3 has an isometric perspective. The old four characters (warrior, wizard, elf and valkyrie) are ready for action again and this time they get backup by four new characters which include the Lizard, Neptune, Stoneman and the Iceman.</desc>

		<desc>This top-down puzzle game starts with a screen featuring a number of red cogs at different parts of the screen, and a grid of pegs (which become less complete on later levels). Your task on each level is to use a number of gears of one of 3 different sizes to ensure that all the pegs are linked together. All this has to be completed before the engine overheats.

Making life harder are two creatures with the peculiar name ‘Poffins’. One of these goes around removing pegs, and the other causes the engine to overheat further. They can be shot out of the way, or have gears placed over them to stop them.

There’s also a bonus round, which is a fruit machine, only with cogs and other things from the game rather than fruit.</desc>

The game consists of 16 courses, which are marked out by giant suspended cones, each of which is to be completed against a time limit, while avoiding contact with the other planes. You must stay within the cones, any time spent outside it results in the alloted time ticking down at a prohibitively fast rate (so don't think of short-cutting the track). After every second successful race, you take on a bonus track, in which balloons must be hit for points.</desc>

Gemini Wing is a vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up, which is distinguished by its unusual power-up system. Instead of gaining occasional tokens which lead to lasting weaponry improvements, occasional flurries of tokens are released to ensure a quick burst of improved fire. The organic backgrounds are detailed, and have many sections which fire at you.</desc>

		<desc>Like so many other puzzle games of the time, this game involves tiles of different colours, which must be manipulated to clear a succession of increasingly-difficult levels.

The basic idea is that you are presented with 2 sets of tiles, and must make the left one identical to the 'control' set on the right. The colours are defined in a sequence - red, green, blue, purple, yellow - and when you click on a tile, that tile's colour moves forward by two in that sequence (for example a blue one becomes yellow), whereas the tiles next to it move by one colour (for example, blue becomes purple). 

Any that move past the end fo the sequence disappear, causing surrounding blocks to drop. You get a limited number of moves, and limited time as well. Fortuantely there are passwords, delivered by cutely-drawn naked Japanese girls (although the private parts are covered up).</desc>

The game uses a refined version of SSI's Antietam game system and is played in 42 turns each representing 1 hour of real time over a 3 day period. Players are awarded points based on casualties and territorial objectives. At the end of each turn and the end of the game points are calculated and compared to a chart which determines your level of victory.

The game can be played under 3 different sets of rules (Basic, Intermediate and Advanced) with 5 levels of difficulty for each and can be played against another person or the computer can play either side.</desc>

		<desc>Ghost Battle is one of the earlier games by the German company Thalion Software. Spanning five short yet difficult worlds, the game borrows its visual style heavily from its better-known contemporaries like Shadow of the Beast and Ghosts 'n' Goblins.

A simple arcade-style action game with some rudimentary adventuring and timing based puzzles thrown in, Ghost Battle casts you as a nameless hero on a quest to rescue his, yet again, nameless girlfriend from a nameless bad guy. Enemies have a horror look and feel to them - ghouls and disembodied heads for example. Initially our hero is armed with rocks, but extra weapons can be collected for specific tasks such as the bosses who end each level.</desc>

		<name>Ghosts 'N Goblins</name>
		<desc>Ghosts 'n Goblins is a platform game where the player controls a knight, named Sir Arthur, who must defeat zombies, ogres, demons, cyclops, dragons and other monsters in order to rescue Princess Prin Prin, who has been kidnapped by Satan, king of Demon World. Along the way the player can pick up new weapons, bonuses and extra suits of armor that can help in this task.[2]

The game is often considered very difficult by arcade standards and is commonly regarded as one of the most difficult games ever released. The player can only be hit twice before losing a life (the first hit takes away Arthur's armor, and the player must continue on in his underwear until completing the level or finding replacement armor). If the player loses a life, he is returned to the start of the level, or the halfway point if he has managed to get that far. Furthermore, each life can only last a certain length of time (generally around three minutes), the clock being reset at the start of a level. If the clock does run out, the player instantly loses that life.

After defeating the final boss, but only with the cross weapon (if the player does not have the cross weapon, they will be prompted that it is needed to defeat the boss and restart at the beginning of level 5 and must repeat round 5 and 6 again regardless if the weapon is obtained immediately or not) for the first time the player is informed that the battle was "a trap devised by Satan". The player must then replay the entire game on a higher difficulty level to reach the genuine final battle.</desc>

		<desc>Three years have passed since Arthur defeated the Demon King Astaroth and rescued his beloved Princess Prin-Prin (see Ghosts 'N Goblins). A new villain, the Great Demon King Lucifer (Loki in some versions) has become the new leader of Ghoul Realm. While returning from a journey, Arthur sees the Princess' castle and her village under attack by Lucifer's forces. While rushing towards her beloved knight, the Princess is struck by one of Lucifer's laser beams.

Now, Arthur must venture back to the Lucifer's palace and destroy the demon in order to rescue the Princess' soul and bring her back to life! And it won't matter whether he fights in his shining armor or in his underwear alone...the bravest Knight in the land isn't going to be stopped by some monsters! Although the game starts with graveyard and marsh territory familiar from the first game, later levels are set in a tower, a mass of skeletons, and a castle.

Players progress from left to right (from bottom to top in level 3), and have to hack down the aforementioned monsters with a sword. The journey includes ledges, ladders, lava pits and slippery slopes. Different weapons can be collected, by finding suits of armor inside chests. Each of the five stages has its own setting and a final boss.</desc>

Suddenly the TV transforms into a jar of pickles. Giddy decides to fight the menace, and return his homeland to normality. But first, he is going to eat the pickles.

Giddy 2 is an Amiga freeware clone of Dizzy and its sequels. Intended as parody of that classic series, it also stars an anthropomorphic egg that must collect objects in order to solve puzzles. On the top screen there are three heart-shaped energy bars for the three lives of the character. If the egg touches any of the enemies, this energy bar decreases, and when it is completely drained the egg explodes with an onomatopoeic "SPLAT!", and the player loses a life. On the top-right side there is the accumulated number of coins collected by the character. Below both items is a black strip that displays the inventory content when in use mode (pressing the space bar enters the use mode, where the player moves the joystick left or right to cycle through the assembled inventory, and hits fire to use the selected object).</desc>

		<desc>Giganoid (in case you hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t guessed) is a variation on the Break-Out/Arkanoid formula, with 50 screens of block groups to destroy. This is an Action game, developed and published by Swiss Computer Arts, which was released in Europe in 1988.

The number of Arkanoid clones on the 16-bit machines is already remarkable, and here, complete with Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ- anoidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ suffix, is yet another. Indeed, Giganoid is the most blatant version yet, with identical bat, bonus capsules, and screen surrounds. Stand by for a possible joint Imagine/Taito legal case against Swiss Computer Arts! The game of Giganoid itself, though, is unlikely to cause any ripples, as it is just the usual very competently programmed affair with no real improvements over Impact, my own favorite of the genre. Anyone who hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seen the many other interpretations of the theme should be well impressed with Giganoid, but only an unusual highscore table screen with impressive rotating coloured bars and didgeridoo samples stick in my mind.

If you already have the Imagine original or AudiogenicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impressive Impact, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t bother with Giganoid, if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, this is the one to check out.

Cheats:
On the player select screen, press the Ã¢â‚¬ËœCAPS LOCKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ key, so the key light is on. Now press and hold the Ã¢â‚¬ËœCAPS LOCKÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and press fire. A message should appear letting you know the cheat is active. If you held down the fire button a little to long the game may have started and bypassed the message, but you should notice you have a lot of lives.</desc>

		<desc>As the title implies, Gloom is an attempt at recreating Doom for the Amiga. In 1995 this was a big target for programmers, as it was felt that the Amiga 1200 was capable of bringing the first person 3D action to life.

Gloom was written by New Zealand's respected Acid Software team, and published by Guildhall who supported the Amiga heavily in its later years. The emphasis was placed on action, rather than collecting keys and negotiating through maps.</desc>

The game is split into three tasks, broadly relating to animal, vegetable and mineral in that order. The first involves defeating an evil witch, the second is the Riddle of the Shrinking Teapot, and the third involves precious stones.

Commands such as FOLLOW, FIND and GO TO make travelling the game world much easier, and put an emphasis on object-manipulation and character interaction, rather than map-making.

Instructions can be issued to other characters, with words like THEN, FIND and GIVE to join them. This co-operation is essential to solve many puzzles, and takes place in a world where characters have their own aims and motives. There are BRIEF and VERBOSE modes of text. The screen display adds a 'g' to the start of all words beginning with n - 'gnorth' and 'gnugget' for example.</desc>

		<name>Gnome</name>
		<desc>Gnome is a Platform game, developed by Vision and published by Linel, which was released in Europe in 1991.

Game that follows the classic Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpick up a bunch of objects to advance to the next levelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ style, but adds a few interesting twists of itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own. Unfortunately, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not very well implemented and the game ends up playing like a below average PD game. WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the game like, then, and why does it fail at being addictive?  Well, read on, and it will all be revealed.

In Gnome, you control a gnome (well, duh!) whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mission it is to pick up as many diamonds as possible. However, the twist is that these diamonds arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t scattered about the single screen levels from the start, but have to be created by the gnome. This is done by throwing a mushroom seed on the ground, and waiting for the seed to grow into large mushroom, which will eventually pop and reveal a diamond. Should you fail to pick up a certain number of diamonds within a time limit, you lose a life.

To help you, you can buy loads of cool stuff from a shop after every second level. The goodies include speedup potions, enemy slowdowns, extra life, and a bunch of other stuff.

So far, so good, then? Well, no. You see, by buying these upgrades, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re making the game incredibly easy. What should have been a frantic hunt for diamonds turn into simply waiting for the mushrooms to pop, while avoiding the occasional slow moving wizard or horned monster. The level design is incredibly bland, and the levels themselves offer no challenges or obstacles at all. The only thing thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s challenged by this game is your patience.

This is a pity, because this game might have been a very addictive game if it had been playtested  properly. The graphics are simple, but pleasant enough, and the music is nice. But the game isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worth your money, so donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t buy it. If you can find it for download on one of the legal adf archives, you might want to have a go at it, though...</desc>

Teams from various European countries are included, and you can customise these by moving players around, and changing the starting lineups and formations. An Arcade Challenge mode sees you play matches against each of the 5 computer team speeds, in succession, until you lose one - you can also arrange leagues or play individual matches.

A wide range of options are included, with variable wind settings, a range of pitches and referees, variable match lengths, and the chance to play up/down or left/right, a choice of close or distant view, and variable computer speed and skill (these can be combined to vary the game quite significantly).</desc>

		<desc>Gobliiins is an adventure game where the player controls a team of three goblins: Oups, Ignatius and Asgard (Hooter, Dwayne, and BoBo in the US release) to find four magic components. A voodoo doll has turned their king Angoulafre mad and by collecting the components they can track down Niak the Wizard, the only one who can put things right. The player needs to solve various puzzles by combining the different skills of the three goblins. It's possible switch between them and control them separately. Most of the puzzles are based on coordinated actions. One can cast powerful but erratic spells, another can collect and use objects, and the last can hit things. Action icons are activated at the bottom of the screen. The game takes in 22 landscapes, each of which has puzzles which must be cleared. The characters have limited energy, which can be sapped by traps.</desc>

Two countries respectively ruled by Queen Xina and King Bodd have been competing over the right to explore the labyrinth. However, strange events started happening one after the other: the guardian of the labyrinth died, his daughter disappeared, and King Bodd apparently fell under some sort of a curse. A goblin reporter named Blount get caught in the midst of these events as he attempts to interview the queen and the king. As if that weren't enough, Blount also gets bitten by a werewolf and falls in love, and must find a way to deal with both predicaments.

Goblins Quest is the third entry in the Gobliiins series. Like its predecessors, it is a puzzle adventure game with the emphasis on solving complex tasks confined to smaller areas rather than on exploration</desc>

		<desc>Y'n Hsi is a Buddhist monk whose father was murdered by a warlord called Ch'un Kuei. In order to defeat the tyrant and regain his family's palace, he must tread the golden path, the road to transcendence.

The Golden Path is a point and click adventure game. Instead of using verbs like in Maniac Mansion, the player controls the monk with the mouse by moving a cursor shaped like a Chinese letter and clicking directly at him on the screen. Left-clicking on a spot on the ground moves the monk towards it. Left-clicking below Y'n Hsi makes him bend over to drop or pick objects on the ground. Left-clicking above his head makes him try to use the object he is holding at the moment (if it is not possible to do so, a question mark appears). Right-clicking makes him punch and kick, his defense against enemies. Every time the monk is hit, the inventory briefly flashes. A book sits at the bottom-left of the screen, and serves as a hint system of sorts. When clicking on it, a message about the screen appears with explanations to events, characters and objects. Besides the book is the inventory with four slots for objects. Left-clicking on an object places it on Y'n Hsi hands. Above the inventory is a slowly withering vine as the energy bar. It grows with the completion of certain tasks. 

The main objective is to follow the golden path. Literally. On the bottom-right of the screen there is a small version of the main game screen that shows the path and its bifurcations. The character moves from screen to screen collecting things laying around, fighting the occasional enemy and using the right object at the right place.

Pressing S saves the game, while typing L loads it.</desc>

		<desc>Bret Conrad is another one of those Vietnam vets with a slight psychological problem. Apparently when bullets fly  kind of lose control a bit of a drawback in a Special Forces commando.

Conrad quest is a flickscreen arcade adventure. He can walk, jump, make long somersaulting jumps, duck, climb ladders and ropes. Hes also armed with a Browning pistol, drawn with a short tap on the firebutton; you can then swing the gun in an arc. Other actions are accessed via the space bar: the icons at the bottom of the screen show the Gun option. Reload (usually automatic, but you might want to top up before nasty screens), Machete (hack at enemies at close range) and Pull Lever. There are also four special options which become available at certain places in the game.

The graphics are generally very good, but youd expect that of a flickscreen game and everything acts as it it in treacle with even the bullets taking their time to move. Each screen was a puzzle requiring deft use of the icon system to beat. Gold provides the same feel of slow, but extremely tough and unforgiving gameplay which demands both careful thought and very fast reactions. Later levels provide plenty of graphic variety and fresh puzzles so it rewards persistence. Without a save game it would be much too frustrating.

Yeah, its worth a look for the excellent and highly varied graphics, good tunes and all-round gloss but youl need quite a bit of patience to stick with it.</desc>

		<desc>In Gold Rush!, Jerrod Wilson (the player) receives a letter from his long-lost brother (who fled the city years before when was hastily accused and convicted of a crime he didn't commit) asking him to join in Sacramento, California. If that's not enough for Jerrod sell everything and give his hometown Brooklyn a fond adieu, under the stamp was one of the first nuggets of Californian gold seen in the Atlantic shores of the United States. So, Jerrod bids farewell to his peaceful life as a newspaper editor, and becomes a fore-runner in the the great Gold Rush of 1849, hoping to find his brother and "strike gold" (literally). Released late into the lifespan of Sierra's AGI engine, Gold Rush! features some tricks not seen before the more advanced SCI engine, such as enlarged characters, but it is best known for the three routes available to reach California: by land, travel by boat to reach the Atlantic shore of Panama, cross the isthmus, and then get a second boat in the Pacific shore, or making the dangerous all-boat trip by Cape Horn. Each route has it's dangers: Cholera might strike as you make your way across the Northern states or your boat might sink.. As usual with Sierra adventures, instant killing happens if the player is careless, but will also happen at random. Other important (and innovative) concept is the game being timed. If Jerrod takes too long to leave Brooklyn, passages to California increase in price, and his house devalues.</desc>

		<name>Graham Taylors Soccer Challenge</name>
		<desc>Graham TaylorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Soccer Challenge is a Football Management game, developed and published by Krisalis Software, which was released in Europe in 1992.

Big sporting events are quite often responsible for the release of quite a few computer sports games. Krisalis havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t missed the bandwagon either, with their Graham Taylor-licensed management game.

You are placed in the driving seat of a hopeful third-division side trying to break through to the higher divisions (and win one or two cup matches to boot). As well as the usual picking of team member and organising of training, you also have to do some nifty dealing to keep your side together.

Graham TaylorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Soccer Challenge is a very slickly produced footy manager game, with more options and features than your usual management sim. Even though there is a lot of game content, the game still manages to offer a lot of smooth presentation to keep you interested. The match-day sections are well done, replacing the usual tiny, badly-animated sprites with some very nice-looking football.

Although the game is not exactly Player Manager, it is still a worthy attempt. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a budding Graham Taylor, then this could have you plugging at the league for some time. Just remember to put three men up front when you are playing Sweden!</desc>

		<name>Grand Monster Slam</name>
		<desc>Every five years the various races inhabiting the fantasy world of GHoLD meet for the Grand Monster Slam tournament to discover which is supreme. You must win a total of 9 matches to prove yourself, with two sub-games to negotiate (Revenge of the Beloms and Faulton Feeding - fortunately these can be practiced from the main menu) as well.

The basic game sees you and your opponent start with a row of six Beloms (small round creatures) which must be kicked across the pitch quickly enough to leave your opponent with all 12 at his end. When this happens you can run to his end to win. The main things to avoid during the match are being hit by a shot and kicking one into the crowd. When hit you lose time recovering, and are penalised with a Pelvan, which can cost you up to 3 Beloms, by hitting the crowd.

After every third match you must play the Faulton Feeding game, which involves aiming at six progressively-higher poles to hit the Faulton creature with the food - fail to get enough of these and you must replay the previous match. After other games you play the Revenge of the Beloms game, in which Beloms hurtle towards you and must be deflected away with your pole - failure to clear enough before one hits you reduces your score from the previous match.</desc>

Rival drivers also have their own styles and strengths, and to win the World Championship you will have to master these. Pitstop timing and planning is crucial as well, although only tires are changed in late-1980s F1.

You can choose whether to drive a single race at Brazil, Britain, Monaco, (Western) Germany [Hockenheim], Canada, Italy, Detroit and Japan [Suzuka] or to drive a full championship on every track. Every Race includes a qualifying round. The graphics in the game are sprite-based.</desc>

		<desc>A motorcycle racing game recreating the now-defunct 80cc world motorcycle racing championship. It was licensed around Spanish ace Jorge Martinez 'Aspar', and your (and his) racing rivals including future 500cc World Champion Alex Criville.

The game features a full practice mode as well as qualifying and races. There are only 8 computer bikes, although the real life championship points system is used, meaning that the penalty for not finishing is bigger than in real life, especially as you only have 5 bikes to last the season. The game is viewed from overhead, and the controls are, unusually, direction based, so to take a straight which (in the overhead view) involves going up and to the right, you must push the joystick in that direction.</desc>

Your spaceship obeys to the law of gravity. You have to use a single thruster to avoid collision with walls or the ground. Various types of enemies will try to hinder your cargo salvage missions.

The single player part of the game consists of a total of 49 mazes. After each five successfully finished levels you will receive a password that allows you to choose the corresponding level as starting point in the main menu. The ten highest scores achieved will be permanently saved on disk.

There are three other game modes available: Race, Two Pilot Race and Dogfight.
In Race mode you can choose one of 10 available tracks and try to achieve best times. You'll have to avoid obstacles similar to the one found single player mission mode, a crash means that the race is over. If you succeed in achieving a track record it will be saved permanently also.
Two Pilot Race offers three different tracks. The screen is splitted into two parts. Your only task is to reach the finish line before your opponent. If you crash you'll be respawned at the starting point.
Dogfight offers two tracks where you can fight against another player. The player which lost all lives first is the looser.</desc>

Centers of gravity create "pits" on that grid, which are the basic obstacles to maneuver around. An alien species called "Outies" plans on transforming all suns of the galaxy into black holes. They feed off raw energy, and as black holes are a good source of that, they attempt to create as many as possible of them. The player is sent out in a scout ship to colonise worlds in an attempt to gain resources to use for battling the Outies.</desc>

This tennis simulation has some nice features. First you create your player. You can distribute some character points (for example: speed, forehand, backhand, etc.) like a role-playing game. These skills will raise after a few winning matches. Then you must select the tournaments you will play. There are all ATP tournaments for choice-  you can also play the Davis Cup. After every tournament you get some price money. There you must play the single and double matches.

In training you can also play against a ball machine or against a friend. It's also possible to play 1 against 2.</desc>

		<desc>I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite know whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happening this month that has sparked off this series of tennis game (two this month, including Passing Shot) but I do know that Wimbledon finished ages ago. A bit behind the times these programmer types.

Great Courts takes the real rock and roll lifestyle of tennis, and sticks you slap bang in the middle of it. You are given a world ranking, and the idea is to improve your ranking by taking part in all the major tennis tournaments of the world against computer simulations of real players such as Ivan Lendl and Bert Becker (or is it Bob?). Obviously, the higher the player ranks, the better they are, and there are no priority restrictions on who you get to play.

Service is a matter of tapping the fire button to lob the ball and moving a crosshair to decide in which direction you want the ball to go. After that, the only real control you have over hitting the ball is just pressing fire. The only real problem is that you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t move and swing at the same time. The bat takes an annoyingly long time to swing, which means that to stand a chance of returning the ball, you have to be on the spot a long time before the ball gets there - youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve just got enough time in most situations. It makes the game annoying if your timing is out, and the fact is that a lot of the time your bat goes through the ball and it bounces between your legs. The ball, not the bat.

Graphics and sound are great. The animation of the characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s is smooth and believable, and the spot FX are very clearly sampled. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just a shame that the game they back up doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite match. Almost but not quite. However itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still great fun, and well worth checking out. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know whether IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rather play this or sleep with Gady Sabatini!</desc>

The game consists of six tracks based on real world locations: Brands Hatch, Silverstone, Belgium, Mexico, Austria and Germany. These can be played in a competition consisting of three laps or in a practice mode with 99 laps (or until the player presses the escape key). In each race there are 23 AI controlled cars to compete against. The game is playable in three difficulties: novice, amateur and professional. The car has six gears that have to be changed manually and a boost feature can also be used for faster acceleration. In addition to racing faster than the opposing drivers the player also has to avoid crashing into the haystacks and the fences that are placed dangerously close to the track.</desc>

The world outside your 'copter is viewed in first person perspective, as usual, and that is how it stays. There are no outside views, there are no missile-eye views. There are no zoom facilities. There is not even a chase plane option. But that is a much more sensible way to generate atmosphere. It is a bit hard to believe in a flight simulator if you are pouncing around outside your plane, zooming in and out, not really flying. In Gunship, you are restricted to three views: look forward, look left and right, and that is the way it should be. After all there are not external views on a real chopper, are there?

This flight sim is fun. The controls are a little sluggish, but I get the feeling that is how they are supposed to handle; after all, this is a low-level combat chopper, not a Fiat Uno. The graphics are great. The clever use of shading mixed with filled vectors gives the game a very solid feel, especially where the enemy craft is concerned. Tanks look like tanks, AA guns look like real AA guns, small frightened people look like real frightened people.

The design of the game is identical in every detail to the 64 version, right down to the loading sequence. The missions follow along the same lines, the five areas you fly over are identical.
What you have here is the same brilliant game, but adapted to suit an Amiga, with better sound, graphics and playability. So who can complain?</desc>

		<name>Hacker II : The Doomsday Papers</name>
		<desc>Hacker II: The Doomsday Papers is a real-time strategy game. It is the sequel to Hacker.

Once again you hack into a computer system, just to end up saving the world. Hacker II: The Doomsday Papers opens with the console to the "Actisource" computer hotline system (a nice self-ironic pun - although nobody knows why a serious hacker might want to crack a help service for computer games...). However, your quiet little hack is soon disturbed: The government wants you for a secret mission. It, again, involves a robot drone and you're the one at the remote control. Although this time, it's not the whole globe that's your playground, but a high security facility in Russia, where the plans for global domination are hidden.

In fact, all you've got to do is to guide your drone to the vault on a 2D map of the building. However, there are two major obstacles: Patrolling guards and security cameras. To avoid detection, you've got to trick the observers. By tapping the surveillance system you can see what cameras are currently active and which rooms they monitor. Your task is to bypass the video signal of the right cameras with a taped recording of an empty room, so that your drone is hidden from the view. You control four monitors, which you may freely switch to show the security monitor, the radar map, VCR output or one of the 38 cameras -- thus keeping an eye on guard movement while simultaneously controlling your drone and synchronizing recordings to cameras. Whew, sounds like a lot of work? It is.</desc>

You're starting into the adventure as a real hacker would do, lacking information of what is to come, only driven by your ambition. Consequently, the game opens with a plain text screen, prompting you for the login password. To break into the system is the first puzzle you've got to solve.

Once in, you'll soon find out that you've accidentally stumbled upon a conspiracy of global impact. From then on, you'll maneuver a robotic drone around the globe through a tunnel system deep in the earth. In major cities, you may surface and talk to contact persons, who'll trade items for cash. When delivered to the correct city, you can exchange these items for a piece of evidence. If all evidence is collected, you're to inform the FBI. As if figuring out the correct routes and trades wasn't hard enough, frequent system malfunctions and security checks test your skill as well...</desc>

		<name>Hammer Boy!</name>
		<desc>Hammer Boy is an Action game, developed and published by Dinamic Software, which was released in Europe in 1990.

Do you still remember those fun old games, with no plot, where you simply wanted to set the high score? Well Hammer Boy is a game just like that. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a boy with a hammer (I bet youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d never guess that one) and your task is to protect the flag! The flag is flying on the top of the tower behind you and there are various enemies trying to take away. Every attack will last 99 seconds (see the counter in the top right corner) and then youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be taken to the next level.

The enemies will try to climb into your base or otherwise damage it (in level one you need to fight off the Indians climbing a wooden fort and shooting burning arrows; the second level takes you to a pirate ship; the third one takes place in a medieval castle; the fourth one in a moon base; and so on). Now as you advance, everything gets more difficult, but you also get more equipment. At the moon base you already get to shoot lasers (when standing to the most right, or most left position).

The graphics are nice enough, although the animation isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t as smooth as it could be. The boy isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t moving he simply disappears from one location and appears at the next one. The sound is nothing much, but it does the job.

Have fun! Tons of fun!</desc>

		<name>Hard Drivin' II</name>
		<desc>Hard Drivin' II is a Racing game, developed by Tengen and published by Domark, which was released in 1991.

Not to be confused with me coin-op sequel Race Drivin, Hard Drivin II is a revision of the original simulator thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s never appeared in the arcades.

At first sight it looks almost exactly the same as HD1. Select the first track from the menu, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re plonked into the seat of a Ferrari F40, which actually looks more like a Lada, so youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to use your imagination a bit. The track looks strangely familiar, until you realise that it actually is the same as the original HD1 track. If you still want more tracks, you can design your own with the circuit editor.

On the matter of gameplay, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s indistinguishable from the original game. In other words, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very slow running on anything below an A1200, to the point where it becomes frustratingly unresponsive. There isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t much competition in the car simulation field, but compared to its closest rival, Stunt Car Racer, HDII is far slower, more limited and loses out in the playability stakes by quite a margin. Even so, if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got an accelerated machine, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mind putting up with a few bugs; and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t already have the first game, Hard Drivin II could provide a pleasant distraction for a few hours.</desc>

		<desc>Hard Drivin' is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. You are in control of a high-performance sports car. Your objective is to race around the course as fast as possible and hit as many checkpoints as possible. If you hit a checkpoint you gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the road both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass... 

The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so on. 

Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is "reset" and you get up to speed again. 

The home conversions retain most of the then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the force-feedback that was in the arcade version.</desc>

		<desc>Hard Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Heavy is a Platform game, developed by Rainbow Arts Software GmbH and published by reLINE, which was released in Europe in 1989.

The game was originally developed as a sequel to The Great Giana Sisters but later was retooled to become Hard 'n' Heavy when Rainbow Arts faced legal troubles from Nintendo due to GianaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s similarity to Super Mario Bros.

Hard 'n' Heavy was a Giana Sisters clone on the C64. Later it was released on Amiga. It is a conversion, so not as good at the original version. The seemingly endless amount of stages that all look the same is what I remember about this game. The only thing that changes is the background colour. The graphics is almost the same, but the music is much worst.

Cheats:
Lose all your lives Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtill you are on your last one. Now find a gorge (2nd level) and wait till the time is at 01. As soon as the timer hits 1 walk into the gorge. You should get times up and the game will restart, but as soon as it does you will die again. Now it will restart again and you will have 99 lives.</desc>

		<desc>Hostile All-Terrain Encounters await in this shoot 'em up notable for it's unusual diagonal scroll, which is similar to Costa Panayi's previous Highway Encounter series. As nobody is qualified to take the enemy on, your task is to complete the 30 levels of training (the actual war could've been the basis for a sequel, although this never happened).

The levels alternate between controlling a Star Fighter plane and a Ground Assault Vehicle; the latter is faster but is confined to ground motion. The plane can move up and down to make dodging the simulated enemy fire easier. This generally comes at you in waves, although there are also ground installations.

Central to the game is to shoot at the cases of plasma crystals, and then fly over these so as to carry them to the end of the level. Dying loses you one of these crystals if you have at least one, or a life if you do not. Completing a level with at least 2 crystals is effectively a restart point as well, as when you die you are sent back to a level in which you collected at least 2.</desc>

Four pieces are needed to complete the level, but there were also other pickups such as ammo and energy. There were 12 levels to complete plus a hidden bonus level.

The player has a choice of four different weapons. The basic pistol had unlimited ammo but did little damage. The machine gun had a faster rate of fire, the laser did more damage and most powerful of all was the rocket launcher - but all three soon ran out of ammo.

The game features parallax scrolling backgrounds and large numbers of enemies (including large rhinos, triceratops and gorillas).</desc>

		<desc>Two distinct characters called Mr Head and Mr Heels are  played in this arcade adventure. They are separated at the shoulders but capable of joining together to maximize their abilities in some situations (but reduce them in others, so they can be split again).

The game is presented from an isometric perspective, and presents the characters with a number of puzzles involving switches, jumps and climbs. The levels are 3 dimensional, and the characters must collect crowns as they progress. Objects can be picked up and manipulated as necessary.</desc>

		<name>Heart of China</name>
		<desc>Heart of China from Dynamix is the second adventure game from the company which is probably better known for flight sims like A10 Tank Killer and the infamous Red Baron. It puts the player into the boots of Ã¢â‚¬ËœLuckyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Jake Masters, an all-American hero who gets a mission to save a  rich manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kidnapped daughter from the hands of the local villain. It is a pointÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢click adventure game which merges a good story with beautiful graphics and stunning music.

Heart of China (HoC) has the same control system Dynamix pioneered in Rise of The Dragon (their first adventure game). HoC can be played either with mouse, keyboard or even with joystick. Only a few actions are available (look, operate, move) but this is supported with some clever inventory manipulation. Most of the scenes are viewed from a first person perspective through your characterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eyes. The first person view means the locations and characters are usually presented with static hand drawn pictures with odd animation sequence here and there. The Amiga version has 32 colour graphics which, despite the low number of colours, manage to look clear and beautiful.

The interactive storyline in Heart of China is not linear - meaning there are several ways to  solve problems and that player actions affect the flow and the direction of the adventure. This also means there are several entirely different endings.

ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very little to fault in this game. Some players might be put off by the fact that unlike in LucasArts adventures, the main character can die or the adventure can otherwise run into a dead end. The control system takes some learning. Also the arcade parts might annoy the adventure game purists.

Without doubt one of the finest adventure games on the Amiga. Heart of China combines quality graphics and sound with a funny and interesting storyline. It contains unique features like plot branches, a totally original control system and deep character interaction. Like Ã¢â‚¬ËœLuckyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Jake Masters likes to think about himself, this one is an Ace.</desc>

		<desc>Just for a change, here's a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players. After all but wiping out humanity, the aliens are planning on coming back and destroying those few survivors who managed to escape to Mars. Attack is the only solution, so it's into your viewed-from-above space ship and the start of four levels of blasting.

As you might expect there is wave after wave of aliens to destroy, but your job is made easier if you can pick up some of the extra weapons amongst which are included twin fire and drones that shoot.

The graphics are fine, it a little basic, and though it scrolls slowly, the ships move well enough and everything is smoothly animated. Unfortunately, the gameplay is not so hot. When you're playing, it's hard to be gripped by that sense of urgency and you're just left feeling 'so what'. It's not very addictive even though the difficulty tuning has been set about right, and after a short time you'll be bored of it.

There's nothing glaringly wrong with this game: it's just that there are several others around that have much more to offer.</desc>

The goal is to destroy a set amount of ground targets in each of the ten vertically scrolling levels. To do so, the player has to change the altitude of the space ship - but flying low creates the danger of crashing into another building. Fuel and shields can be replenished by flying over especially marked buildings. Of course there is also alien opposition which is dealt with by shooting them. Later levels introduce additional challenges like laser fences which have to be passed through with the correct timing.</desc>

		<name>Hellraider</name>
		<desc>Hellraider is a Shoot 'Em Up game, developed by Frames and published by ARC (Atari UK), which was released for Amiga in 1989.

I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t say I was particularly impressed by Hellraider which is another run-of-the-mill shootÃ¢â‚¬â„¢em-up, with not a lot else to offer. The games manual is very large, and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a huge section describing the story behind the game, but after youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve read it youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll do exactly the same as before, and shoot anything that isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you. The controls are very awkward, and moving in to the right position to fire at something can become annoying.

The graphics is well defined, but rather small and boring due to the use of colour. The aliens are of a kind shot countless times before, and the game looks dated. The sound is minimal with the usual zaps and bangs but nothing oustanding. A nice piece of music on the title screen. 

WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worse, is that the gameplay is uninteresting and dull. Scooting around the planetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surface soon gets repetitive, and attacking the odd alien base did nothing to relieve the tedium either. Basically, Hellraider is a very dull shootÃ¢â‚¬â„¢em-up that would be more suited to an 8-bit machine, and offers nothing new or original. Not something IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rush out and buy.</desc>

		<name>High Seas Trader</name>
		<desc>High Seas Trader is a Strategy game, developed and published by Impressions Games, which was released in Europe in 1995.

High Seas Trader from Impressions takes the same concept as Ã¢â‚¬ËœPirates!Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ and expands it further. It builds on the same basic elements offered in the aging MicroProse classic and adds more complex simulation of sea combat and trading. But does it beat Sid MeyerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s masterpiece?

The AGA version of High Seas Trader comes on four disks. A decent manual with Amiga technical supplement and a tutorial book is provided within the package. The game is hard disk installable.

The player takes the role of a merchant sea captain during the 17th and 18th centuries. The short term goal of the game is to profitably trade between various ports while managing your own ship. The long term goal is to rise within the ranks of the Merchant Guild with the ultimate goal of reaching the status of Viscount. Trade is a complex beast in this game. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a large quantity of commodities which can be sold around the world. As the prices change through time, players must very carefully plan the actions if he (or she) means to succeed in their selected career. This can get quite frustrating in the beginning but gets easier when the game progresses and the player gets more accustomed to the game world, tactics and politics.

In conclusion, High Seas Trader offers an entertaining mix of business sim and challenging sea combat simulation. Those who invest the time and effort will ultimately find the game a thrilling experience. To
the more impatient players who would like a taste of life at sea, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d recommend getting Ã¢â‚¬ËœPirates!Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ as it is generally easier for beginners to get into. But if you have played Ã¢â‚¬ËœPirates!Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ to the death and yearn for
similar but deeper challenges, you cannot go wrong with High Seas Trader.</desc>

		<desc>Highway Patrol 2 is a Racing game, developed by MicroÃƒÂ¯ds and published by Titus Software, which was released in Europe in 1989.

Can there be any job as physically and mentally demanding as a highway cop? Driving for hours at speed with only the law and a powerful handgun for protection, your only reward is large sums of money for every criminal you catch.

You are a rookie cop trying for promotion and eagerly awaiting all the perks that come with it. To gain it you have to stick to the rules and get the job done correctly. Blazing across open country and opening fire on any car that gets in your way is just one way of not doing the job correctly.

 The still graphics are very impressive, the lovely graduated horizon gives a wonderful feeling of distance, and the other cars are large and detailed. The only real problems set in when the things start moving. The update is appalling, and that is only on the roadway. The update of the other cars is even worse. There cannot be any more than six frames from horizon to near distance.

The sound, on the other hand, is pretty good. The tune that intros the game is a bit weak, but the in-game FX are great. Hear those sirens whine, and the sound of your bullets striking opposing cars and cacti alike.

It does provide some fun, though I find the overcomplicated map system a little off putting at times. Worth a blast, but with smoother scrolling and perhaps an in-game map it would be worth buying.</desc>

		<name>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons : Hillsfar</name>
		<desc>Players start their game by creating a character. The game provides three choices: players may select a pre-made character, create their own, or import characters from previous Strategic Simulations Dungeons &amp; Dragons computer games, such as Pool of Radiance and Curse of the Azure Bonds. When creating a character, players may determine the character's race (dwarf, elf, human or gnome), character class (cleric, fighter, magic-user or thief), and alignment. Various characteristics of the new character, such as strength and intelligence, are assigned a random value by the computer.



There are two aspects to the game: arcade action, where the player performs tasks (expressed as mini-games) such as searching for treasure and traveling between locations, and adventure, where the player completes quests. The choice of character class affects the available quests, with three for each class. While the quests need to be completed in a set order, "what you do in your time off is up to you", and thus the player is free to explore other aspects of the game.



The game is presented in three modes. When traveling, the scene is presented using a side-on view; once in the town of Hillsfar, the game converts to a "bird's-eye view" of the map; a first-person perspective is employed within the caves. Interaction is handled through what Leslie Fiser of Compute! magazine described as a "bump interface", which allows the player to trigger interaction with objects by bumping into them.</desc>

Take a team of elite soldiers and choose a mission like blow up some reactors, or steal secret plans. Kit them out with weapons and equipment, and take turns to explore the map and fight the enemies. Maps can be fixed or random. Many of the gameplay elements and maps were re-used for my first PC game, Arcangel (1999), and much later, the PC game Taskforce which was remastered for Steam in 2020.</desc>

		<name>Hired Guns</name>
		<desc>Hired Guns is an action/adventure/RPG hybrid using square-based movements, à la Dungeon Master, in which up to four players can take part and set in a futuristic setting. The screen is split into 4 parts (or 3 in case 3 players play together), each one representing the viewpoint of the characters, these being selected from a team of 12 available mercenaries.

If one player plays alone, he will control all 4 characters, using the mouse to navigate between each character viewpoints. A follow mode is available to avoid tedious numerous amounts of clicking when moving several characters. If two players play together, then each player will use a mouse to control two characters.

In three or four-player mode, players can freely choose to control their characters via either a joystick/joypad or some of the predefined keyboard layouts or a mouse. When 4 people play together, the screen will display 4 viewpoints, like in 1 and 2-player modes. In 3-player mode, the top of the screen displays two viewpoints for player 1 and 2, but the lower part of the screen displays a single viewpoint, centered, for player 3.

Three game modes are available.
The Training mode features 5 simple maps on which the player(s) can learn how to move, use inventory items etc...

The Full Campaign mode takes the player(s) to the far reaches of the Luyten planetary system, on the planet Graveyard. Battling through more than 20 theaters of engagement, your team of mercenaries test their limits of military prowess in order to wipe out all threats on the planet surface. To this end, they have to make their way through the different missions and gather 4 fusion power core rings, before entering the final mission in the Spaceport.

Finally, in Short Action game mode, the player(s) can choose between 17 maps. On those maps, the player(s) will have to fight some enemies to reach the exit within a specified time limit. Additionally, when more than one player takes part in the mission, players will compete with each other since only the first to reach the exit will win.</desc>

Both players act simultaneously on a split screen. While one player can move his units, the other can attack and vice versa. The results of battles are shown in animated sequences.

Terrain affects the performance of units, and seasons affect the likely terrain. Different units are introduced as the game and war progress, with more air and sea battles later on.

There are 24 single-player maps in the game, which can be played from either the German or French perspective. In addition, there are 12  two-player maps.

The game also includes a lot of information about the period: after each mission, historical facts about two months of wartime are displayed.</desc>

Hazards include sand traps, tunnels and tubes, running water, and a windmill where you have to get the timing right to knock the ball between the spinning blades.

Gameplay is unchanged from the original game: players are tasked with leading a horde of Lemmings to the level exit by assigning them special abilities. The holiday theme shows in snow-covered landscapes, the Lemmings wearing Christmas outfits and appropriate background music. The game includes 32 all-new levels, grouped into two difficulties: Frost and Hail. It also comes with all 32 levels from the 1993 version (Flurry and Blizzard difficulties).</desc>

		<name>Hollywood Poker Pro</name>
		<desc>Hollywood Poker Pro is a Adult Card game, developed and published by reLine, which was released in Europe in 1989.

One after another these strip poker games appear; sequels, updates, data disks, the only variations occuring in the quality of the graphics. Hollywood Poker was one of the first on the Amiga, and now Hollywood Poker Pro has arrived you can do it all over again.

It starts off well with a digitised silhouette of a girl dancing to some sampled music, rather like the title sequence of Tales of the Unexpected. When you have had enough of that you can choose to play against one of four girls. Once your opponent runs out of credits she sells an item of clothing for another 100 credits. If your balance falls below zero you lose the game.

The graphics are sharp, but if you want a close-up you can use the zoom feature which doubles the pixel size. A few slow tunes play in the background but are not the sort of thing you can bear for long.

Just like all the others, Hollywood Poker Pro is a good laugh with the boys, and once you have started you have to beat them all. When you have done that, and it wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take long, I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see anyone coming back to it. I wont pretend I found it offensive, boring or tasteless. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just a good bit of fun, but a very short-lived bit of fun. I wouldn't bother with it too much, as it just doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t offer good value for the money. But itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s better than playing chess with your brother on a rainy day.</desc>

Now there are two burglars who want to break into the house. Kevin has to prevent the burglars from kidnapping him, by riddling the house with traps.

The player controls Kevin through the mansion in a side perspective. He has one hour before the burglars will break into the house. In this hour, the player has to set up various traps in order to make the burglars give up on capturing Kevin. After this hour, the burglars break in, and the traps become active. Each trap deals 5 damage to a burglar, and the first shot of Kevin's BB gun deals another 5. During this phase, the screen always tells in which room each burglar is at the moment. The game is won by dealing 50 damage to each burglar.</desc>

Another could-have-been-OK Hannah-Barberra release from Hi-Tec; for a budget game this would be quite respectable if weren't for the sluggish controls which render it pretty much unplayable -- there's a huge delay between moving the joystick up and Hong Kong jumping, which makes for frustrating gameplay: even with the cheat you'd have to have the patience of a saint to play this for too long.

It's a point and click adventure, and the pirate setting ensures that it recalls the Monkey Island games.

		<name>Horror Zombies from the Crypt</name>
		<desc>Why do they bother? Companies trying to do Ã¢â‚¬ËœscaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ horror games. I mean They sure as hell donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t scare anybody and nine times out of ten theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re decidedly mediocre anyway. This is certainly true of the awesomely below-average Horror Zombies from the Crypt, a game that supposedly pays homage to the classic horror flicks of yesteryear. In it you play a hapless hero who stumbles into a creepy mansion in the dead of night (oh yes, because that sort of thing happens all the time) and then has to try and escape. 

Naturally this unlikely scenario manifests itself into a scrolling arcade adventure with the baddies all extras from various generic cinematic shockers. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got zombies, vampires, frankensteins stumbling about after youÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all quite predictable really. The basic object is to avoid these meanies (or, better yet, kill them with your throwing knives), explore the various levels, collect keys and objects, unlock doors... you know the sort of thing. There are some vague platform elements - many items of furniture can be climbed and jumped on, and in some cases moved about.

If anything, Horror Zombies is best compared to something like The Addams Family - although this canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t dare to hold a candle to OceanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s classic platformer. Here the action is stunted, slow and unexciting. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very little to hold your attention, and the rather gratuitous death sequence (your head blows up unconvincingly), little effort has gone into trying to make the game anything like the horror movies itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s supposed to be a tribute to. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not totally unplayable, but it lacks imagination, hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been very well put together and as a result comes across as one of the most mediocre games weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen in a good few months. Buy something else instead.</desc>

		<name>Hostile Breed</name>
		<desc>Following the success of Apidya and Sim Ant, insect-related games are back in vogue, or so it would seem. And PalaceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s release is no exception, pitching you against hordes of insect-nasties in a deep-space moonbase, but it has a few other elements which make it something more than just another blast-em-up.

Hostile Breed combines all the excitement and action of a shoot-em-up with the strategy elements youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d expect to find in a simulation. The chief element of strategy centres on the base complex where you find yourself on the receiving end of a massive invasion. The eight-legged moonbase has just been through an earthquake which has cracked the walls. Insect aliens are pouring through these breaches by the dozen, heading towards the control room. If they get there, all hell will break loose, and your game will be over.

In short, Hostile Breed is an eight level shoot-em-up, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s laid out in such a way that you can get to any level whenever you like. The control centre is a vital piece of the jigsaw, and devoted shoot-em-up fans might at first find this a bit too much for them to handle.

The Ã¢â‚¬Ëœin-betweenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ scenes and the death-screen are pleasing, but not great, while the in-game sprites are vaguely cartoon-like. The sound effects are raunchy enough, but there are quite as many as youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d probably like to give you the real atmosphere. 

You have to hand it to Palace, Hostile Breed is not your ordinary shoot-em-up. If you want a bit of Ã¢â‚¬ËœthinkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and your Ã¢â‚¬ËœshootÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re opposed to mind violence (but not plain olÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ everyday violence), go for it. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll enjoy it.</desc>

		<desc>Hot Rod is a top-view racing game influenced by Super Sprint, in which three miniature cars race to complete a race as quickly as possible, by rotating, accelerating and braking at the right moments. You start with limited fuel, but more can be collected as you cover the track. Hitting hazards can cause your car to explode, thus costing time as it is replaced.

Unusually the racetracks are linear rather than lap-based, so each round involves covering a section of track once. After each race, you can purchase upgrades at the shop, depending on how much money you earned in the previous race.

Only part of the circuit is shown at a time, and this scrolls following the leader. If you fail to keep up with this, your car is moved forward on the track, with a penalty fuel deduction. This is slightly similar to the system later used in head-to-head games of Micro Machines, and is especially punishing while you are on roads travelling horizontally and the leading CPU car is travelling vertically, as it makes the margin for error much smaller.</desc>

Grand Prix 500 2 is your standard bike racing scenario, featuring a handful of riders racing hell for leather around the most famous courses of the world, pausing only to collect medals and shake champagne all over each other.

I must admit, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a very big fan of bike racing games. From Team Suzuki to Super Hang On, I always have my eye out for a new one. This is quite definitely the most appalling one I have ever seen. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s completely unplayable in every respect, with a useless two player mode and some of the smallest player windows ever seen.

You begin as always on the starting grid and at this point things look really good. The graphics are fine and detailed and everything looks fairly realistic. Then the light turns green and the other riders hit the horizon in about three hops. Push forward to get moving and you hit this gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s big problem. Rather than have you at the centre of the screen with the road swinging around as you change lanes, the programmers obviously decided that that was too much hassle, and opted for the other side of the coin, which involves the road being centred and the sprite of the bike moving around unrealistically. The result of this is that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s impossible to judge corners correctly, and as for overtaking - forget it.

This is one useless game. Even as a budget title, it just isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worth the disk itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s recorded on.</desc>

		<name>Hotshot</name>
		<desc>A simple two-player game released to much marketing fanfare, Hotshot places you and another player (either another person or an AI robot) in an arena split down the middle into two save for a hole about half the screen's height for the ball to travel through, with a series of bricks on each side to destroy.

The aim of the game is to destroy your own bricks before your opponent can destroy his. This is achieved by catching the small by pointing your suction device at it and holding fire, and then releasing in the needed by letting go of the button. This is easier said than done, as the ball neither moves in a straight line or according to the natural rules of.gravity.

Should either player be hit with the ball and not catch it properly, they will be knocked down and possession of the ball is passed to the other player.</desc>

		<name>Huckleberry Hound in Hollywood Capers</name>
		<desc>As famous dogs go, this one is up there with the best of them. Fred Bassett, Lassie, Snowy, Muttley, Bouncer, Deputy Dawg, Rin Tin Tin, Nipper, K-9, Pickles, a quick office straw poll revealed other dogs of repute, but none of these venerable hounds have had their own game after them. Anyway, HuckÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s treasured films Oscars have been half-inched and he has got to sniff around Cartoon World to goldenly retrieve them.

IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like to know exactly how long they spent working out the insulting excuse for a plot. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d quite like to be told exactly how the Ã¢â‚¬ËœHollywood CapersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ of the title relate to the platforms-against-a-wibbly-green-and-black-background that comprises the games graphics. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d be quite pleased to learn if the programmers had any tricky moments drawing the total of four different frames required for Huck to walk and jump in two directions. 

A barkingly mad platformer, Huckleberry Hound is not, I am afraid, the dogÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s danglies. There are plenty of levels, but the gameplay is poor and the sprites are about as animated as something not very animated. The revolutionary gameplay has you scaling platforms, collecting diamonds and dodging drips of gooey stuff.

If there was an award for the worst use of a character license in a platform game, this would walk away with it, no problem. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s horrifying to think that someone actually programmed this, and then had the front to release it.</desc>

In this game, players control Kwon, dubbed the Human Killing Machine. He has vowed to demonstrate the power of his homeland; and does this by battling a series of opponents in several countries such as Moscow, Amsterdam, and Barcelona. HKM uses the term 'knockdown' for players who defeat their current opponent. Three knockdowns are needed for the player to move onto the next opponent.

Bonus points are awarded for the remaining energy Kwon has when he has successfully defeated his opponent. The player has five lives, and if all of them are used up, the game is over.</desc>

Fully 3D, you have the choice to go anywhere you please during any mission. A focus is put on freedom of choice; there's no one way to complete a mission. You can take control of any vehicle in the game, and these range from riding pedal bikes and windsurfing, to vans and ambulances, to tanks and armoured cars, to battleships and helicopters. Your arsenal includes grenades, explosives, various gadgets and a handgun, though deadlier weapons are mounted on some of the vehicles. Or if you prefer, you can acquire an enemy uniform and sneak in rather than blast your way through.

There are also many structures to be found, many containing regular citizens who may be interacted with (talking to them, bribing them...), though there are also more specialised structures which may contain vehicles, ammo, or anything you might find useful to your mission.</desc>

		<desc>The Cold War may well be long over but when has reality ever been relevant to computer games? In the game of the film of Tom Clanceys novel, Marko Ramius  commander of Russias most powerful nuclear submarine, The Red October Ã¢has been tempted by the Wests good life and hes going in his sub! The Russians are a bit annoyed about this ad decide to sink him. However, Ramius does get some help from CIA operative Jack Ryan who sets up a plan to sneak the sub into the US. Meanwhile, the Octobers chef, Loginov, is missing his vodka and caviar and gets angry enough to threaten to explode the subs nuclear warheads unless it turns around. At the end, Jack will have a final chance to save the day in a Cabal-style screen, taking pot shots at the chef who dodges between the warheads, returning fire.

Games standard movie approach, using a familiar main game-style with a couple of sub-games recreating key scenes has been copied by Grandslam to little effect. Unambitious horizontal sub sections but the 3-D for the helicopter drop and mini-sub scenes is fast and well executed. Sound consists of variety of atmospheric tunes, but weak rendition of movie soundtrack.

The Hunt for Red October: The Movie Amiga game veers towards high difficulty in places, with an amazingly restrictive sub section, and then throws in some attractively done but laughably simple 3-D sequences. If you want a game of the film then buy the game of the book  far better FMV.</desc>

		<name>Hyperdome</name>
		<desc>Hyperdome is a Shoot 'Em Up game, developed by Microwish and published by Exocet, which was released in Europe in 1989.

The training as fighter pilot for the Federation took five years. Now you are finished. But there is a final test to master: survive the 'Hyperdome'.

The player is thrown in the Hyperdome with his space ship, the landscape is scrolling horizontally, and to survive, you have to shoot everything in sight. Your ship is equipped with a basic laser cannon. Luckily, some opponents drop collectible markers, which increase a counter visible on the right side of the screen. If you reached the weapon or bonus of your choice, you can activate it. There are nine extras available: increased ship speed, increased fire power, double fire, missiles, spread (clears in front), homing missiles, a satellite and a shield. If you loose one of your initially nine lives, the current extra weapon is gone. If you collect too many items without activating a weapon, the count is set back to the first bonus.

Of course, your ship is crashing if the landscape blocks are touched - this is integral part of the design, as some levels build up less on shooting, but avoiding and securely navigating through the many obstacles on the way.</desc>

Contested by two teams of eleven players each, cricket is a very technical bat-and-ball game played on a grass oval-shaped field, in the centre of which are a flat strip of ground, called a cricket pitch, and two wooden wickets placed at each end of the pitch. The bowler, a player from the fielding team, bowls a hard, fist-sized cricket ball from the vicinity of one wicket towards the other. The ball usually bounces once before reaching the batsman, a player from the opposing team. In defence of the wicket, the batsman plays the ball with a wooden cricket bat. Meanwhile, the other members of the bowler's team stand in various positions around the field as fielders, players who retrieve the ball in an effort to stop the batsman scoring runs, and if possible to get him or her out. The batsman ? if he or she does not get out ? may run between the wickets, exchanging ends with a second batsman (the "non-striker"), who has been waiting near the bowler's wicket. Each completed exchange of ends scores one run. Runs are also scored if the batsman hits the ball to the boundary of the playing area. The match is won by the team that scores more runs. Choosing between a bowler, or a batsman, game player defines the role of its team. During the match game player may control all his team players, nearest to the ball to achieve the main goal. Power, direction, and the moment should be used properly to achieve it more successfully. Eight countries (England, New Zealand, Australia, Sri Lanka, South Africa, India, West Indies, and Pakistan) are available to select and game player/players may be appointed either to CPU, which has a three difficulty levels, or to human.</desc>

		<desc>Ice Runner is a Platform game, developed and published by Magic Soft, which was released in Europe in 1991.

Pretty decent Lode Runner variant in which you evade colour swapped clones of your player sprite, collect fruit, and then try to escape the level. I think the playability of Ice Runner is just right. On the other hand, the game lacks variety: There is only a single tile set for level graphics and there is only a single track of background music. The samples can get annoying after a while, too. You might want to turn off your Amiga's speakers and turn on some relaxing music from your stereo instead.</desc>

		<name>Immortal, The</name>
		<desc>The Immortal is an isometric action-adventure game.

Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of 
isometric death await.

The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards. In short: You want to see what challenge lies in the next room.

The puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps to the correct use of items; you collect objects in an inventory. Every now and then, The Immortal surprises with a special challenge. For example, you've got to ride a magic carpet through a hallway full of fire traps, or ride a barrel on an underground river. The dungeon isn't empty: some friedlies may have valuable information or trade items, the nasty sort of guys will attack. Combat is fought man-to-man on a special screen. Your adversary indicates his next attack a few seconds before he executes it, so you've got time to react appropriately. You can dodge to the left or the right, as well as attack from these two directions. There is no save option in the game, of course, but you may restart each level as often as you like. Levels can be skipped by entering passwords.</desc>

IMPACT unashamedly takes you back to the days when games were about fun, and didn't need 17 disks, or manuals two feet thick. When your kid brother, or grandmother could join in without anyone getting embarrassed!

The concept is simple - knock bricks out of the wall, one by one, until you've cleared the screen. Catch the glittering tokes that fall and you'll be able to trade them for powerful weapons - wide bat, multi-ball, laser, and missiles are just for of the options.

IMPACT has 80 classic levels, plus 48 bonus levels that you can change yourself. Make them as hard, as simple, as much fun as you like!

If you thought the fun had gone out of computer games, then this is the game that'll change your mind.</desc>

		<desc>A bat. And a ball. That bounces. It is a simple premise. And as some clever bloke found out at the dawn of computer gaming, it is really good fun. Simple, yes, but fun in the extreme.
But things do not stay still in the fast moving world of games, oh no. And so a simple bat and ball game gets loads of power-ups, wacky level designs and if you are really lucky even some decent collision detection. In fact, you could say, it is a whole new ball game.

It is all good stuff so far, but there is something not quite right when you get down to playing the game. Some of the levels are downright boring and others are just stupid, but it is not just level design. Playing just is not enough fun. Everything works fine, even if the mouse control is a little over sensitive, but you always get the sense that when you lose a ball, it was not the fact that you were not in the right place and at right time, but that the game had already decided you were going to lose a life.

Yes, I know that makes me sound like a paranoid madman, but that is the only way I can describe it. It is cheap, playable and intriguing to start with, but eventually becomes slow, repetitive and slightly annoying. But it scores points for the user-friendly level editor.</desc>

As with Core's previous hit Rick Dangerous 2 there is versatility in the exact structure of the game. The first four consist of the Orient, a Klondike mine, an Ice world and an Amazon forest - once these are completed the final world is open to you.

The platform-based gameplay is similar to Monty's earlier games, with primarily horizontal progresses as well as ropes and ladders to navigate. Monty has developed a useful flying kick, and has been given a smart bomb, with the potential to collect extra bombs and guns. Hazards, enemies and level designs are themed around each level, and range from cable cars and falling snowballs to Ninjas and Monkeys.</desc>

You play a crash test dummy, trying to progress through levels filled with hazards such as cars and fireballs, within the time limits. Contact with each of these loses you a limb, and once you have none left, contact means game over. Since the character isn’t handicapped by missing limbs in any way, in practical terms you can think of these as hit points  especially as there are screwdrivers to pick up which restore one limb.</desc>

Most action takes place in isometric view, although there are some variations along the way to keep up interest. There are even some adventure-game elements, such as Indy's inventory which you can fill with various objects to use (i.e. money to buy things).

		<desc>Indiana Jones is back! The great archaeologist and adventurer has to solve a grand mystery once again, aided by his trusty whip, his sharp wit, and his courage. A man who calls himself Mr. Smith is interested in a certain ancient statue. When the unsuspecting Indy hands it over to the client, he finds out that Mr. Smith is in fact a colonel in the Nazi army! Why was he so interested in that statue? A girl who had once worked together with Indy, the pretty red-haired (and a bit troublesome) Sophia, tells him the whole thing must have a connection with the legendary lost continent Atlantis. Gathering clues from all over the world, Indy and Sophia embark on their greatest journey!

Fate of Atlantis is not a movie spin-off, but an independent adventure with a brand new story. The gameplay utilizes LucasArts' famous SCUMM system, with action verbs the player chooses from a menu; the objects that can be interacted with are highlighted. The game contains many puzzles of various kinds (mostly inventory-based) and dialogues with multiple choices. There are also a couple of hand-to-hand fights against the Nazis. The middle part of the game can be played in three "modes": co-operation (Indy and Sophia), adventure (Indy alone), and action (Indy alone, with less puzzles and more action). In each mode there are different locations to visit, different puzzles to solve, and different characters to meet.</desc>

		<name>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure</name>
		<desc>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure is a graphic adventure game, originally released in 1989 (to coincide with the release of the film of the same name), published by Lucasfilm Games (now LucasArts). It was the third game to use the SCUMM engine.

The plot closely follows, and expands upon, the film of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. As the game begins, Indiana Jones has returned to his college, after reclaiming the Cross of Coronado. He is approached by businessman Walter Donovan, who tells him about the Holy Grail, and of the disappearance of Indy's father.

Indy then travels to some of the places seen in the movie, such as Venice and the catacombs, after meeting fellow archeologist Elsa Schneider. In the process he finds his father held captive in the Brunwald Castle, after passing through the mazelike corridors, fighting and avoiding guards. Then Elsa's double role is revealed when she steals the Grail Diary from Indy. After escaping, father and son pass through Berlin to reclaim the Diary and have a brief meeting with Hitler. Then they reach an airport, from where they intend to seek the Valley of the Crescent Moon, by Zeppelin or biplane. There are many action scenes, involving fists, and the biplane sequence above Europe, pursued by Nazi planes.

Several key elements of the movieÃ¢â‚¬â€such as the Brotherhood of the Grail, Indy's friend Sallah, and the Venice water chase and the desert battle scenes (except for small hidden references)Ã¢â‚¬â€were not included in the game.

Last Crusade was one of the most innovative of the LucasArts adventures. It expanded on LucasArts' traditional adventure game structure by including a flexible point system - the IQ score, or "Indy Quotient" - and by allowing the game to be completed in several different ways. The point system was similar to that of Sierra's adventure games, however when the game was restarted or restored, the total IQ of your previous game was retained. The only way to reach the maximum IQ of 800 was by finding alternative solutions to puzzles, such as fighting a guard instead of avoiding him. This countered one common criticism of adventures games, whereby since there is only one way to finish the game, they have no replay value. Some of the alternative fights, such as the one with the Zeppelin attendant, were very difficult to pass, so the maximum IQ was very difficult to acquire.

The game was released in May 1989 simultaneously with the movie. It was available for</desc>

		<name>Indianapolis 500 : The Simulation</name>
		<desc>Indianapolis 500: The Simulation is a 1989 computer game. It was hailed as the first step of differentiating racing games from the arcade realm and into racing simulation.[1] It was developed by the Papyrus Design Group, consisting of David Kaemmer and Omar Khudari,[2] and distributed by Electronic Arts. It first released for DOS and later for the Amiga in 1990.

Indianapolis 500: The Simulation attempts to be a full simulation of the Indianapolis 500 race, with 33 cars and appropriate Indy car "feel". While racing, it only offers a first-person perspective, but the game offers a replay mode as well. Indy 500 offers the ability to realistically set up the car, and any changes made to the car directly affect how it handles.

The field is represented as realistic and the qualifying order stays true to the 1989 Indianapolis 500 starting grid, with one exception: the player's car, numbered 17, replaces Car #29 of Rich Vogler, who qualified in 33rd and last place.</desc>

		<desc>The story of Indigo is quite simple. You play Jack, a young kid who loves drawing in a book the adventures of his imaginary friend Indigo. But Indigo gets trapped for some reason inside the book. It leaves no other choice to Charley but to go inside his own worlds in the hope of rescuing his friend.

Indigo is a platformer where the objective is to reach the end of each level within the time limit. To open the exit, you have to find all the keys. The number of keys left is displayed in the bottom right corner of the screen. Some of the keys can be found on monsters.

Controls are simple. You can walk left and right. Jump by pushing the joystick upward. While jumping, press fire to go into attack stance and land on monsters to stun them. You can then bounce on the monster until he awakens or kill him by attacking again. You can also stand beside the monster and press fire to grab him. Press fire to throw him at enemies. Some monsters can't be stunned. Also, a thrown monster will make every hidden bonus appear in its path.

There are a variety of power ups you can find throughout the game. The remaining active time gauge is displayed in the top left corner.

Author, Stephane Belin said: Indigo does not pretend to be the greatest game but I had a very good time creating it. I hope you'll enjoy it for what it is.</desc>

		<desc>Danny Sullivan, 1988 IndyCar champion and winner of the classic 'Spin &amp; Win' Indianapolis 500 in 1985, put his name to this Super Sprint style racing game. There are 4 cars in each race, 1 or 2 player options, and 9 tracks to race on, with the Tradewest Speed Bowl the ultimate target, and is much longer but with double points (it's essentially a substitute for the licensed-elsewhere Indianapolis 500, which did pay double the usual level of IndyCar championship points for many years).

The player has limited fuel, and will run slowly if supplies run out, and the car can be damaged, although both are repairable in the pits. They get a turbo to use sparingly, which can also be recharged in the pits if they have bought more. After each race the player will get money (slightly more for a higher finish), which can be spent on upgrades such as improved power, brakes or more turbos.</desc>

The thundering explosion echoes throughout the enclosure when you destroy a Gatepod. You hear your heart-rate accelerate as you progressively clear your way toward the installation. Don't take too long or the Gateprotectors will seek you out and end your mission. There are twenty installations to destroy. Each one becomes an increasingly difficult task as the Gatepod locations become trickier and the Galeprotectors become more aggressive. You feel the power of your ship's Inertia Drive as you locate your adversaries, but beware! If you cannot control it, you may end up crashing to your doom. Use the power of the Drive to propel your ship while you target and destroy the Gatepods, attacking Gateprotectors and the Central Installation to complete your mission.</desc>

		<desc>Infection is a public domain Ataxx-type game. Starting in the corners, players take it in turns to place a marker of their colour on the grid. An existing marker can be moved two places away, or a new marker can be created within one space of a player's existing marker. If the marker is placed directly next to an opponent's marker, it will take over that marker's position. The game finishes either when the board is full (the player with the most markers wins) or there is only one player with markers left on the board (having taken over all other markers). 

Up to four players can take part, and they can either be human controlled or CPU controlled. There are nine different board layouts, some featuring barriers dividing parts of the board.</desc>

The game is viewed in 3D from Solar's perspective, with a full HUD built into his helmet showing direction, health and supplies. Other HUDs also allow you to check whether the current air is breathable (you have limited oxygen), as well as one built into your Jetpack.

There are two movement modes, one of which allows you to pan the view and the other allows you to shoot. Objects have to be picked up and used, computers operated, and an infra-red kit located and used. To win the game you will have to destroy all the eggs, and then shut the compound down and escape in time.</desc>

		<name>Innocent Until Caught</name>
		<desc>Innocent Until Caught is a graphic adventure game with an icon-based point-and-click interface.

Jack T. Ladd is a thief, his hunting-ground is the whole galaxy, and at the moment, he's in big trouble. He's got 28 days to pay his taxes - or else the interstellar tax agency will hunt him down. Termination is a viable punishment for tax offenders in these days, you know. Stranded blank on the barren, run-down planet Tayte, Jack decides that he has to make some cash. Quick.

Innocent Until Caught is pretty standard in terms of design but introduces some innovations when it comes to the interface. It features a mini-window at the bottom left of the screen which is alternately a mini-map of the area (showing all exits) and a looking glass for detecting small items. The inventory is a box-window in which objects can be placed wherever player wants (even on top of others). Also, the plot is illustrated by a few rendered sequences, some of the first used in adventure games.</desc>

You have been sent to the Interchange, a highly sensitive area, which has been invaded by Victor Virus and his gang of bugs. On 50 circuits they have changed the direction of some of the blocks on each circuit and your task is to straighten them all back up. Viewed from above with each circuit shown on screen you must walk along the circuits to the misaligned pieces and turn them back round to the correct position and a ping sounds when it is in the correct position. As you sort the circuit some of Victor's bugs roam the circuits as well and you can either avoid them, shoot them with limited balls or turn a piece of circuit round when they are next to it to destroy them. Once all the bugs have been destroyed they don't reappear. If you touch a bug, fall through a gap or fall of the edge of the circuit then you lose one of five lives and when all lives are gone it is game over. There is a password provided after every five levels to stop you repeating too many circuits. There is also a clock counting down and the circuit must be completed within the time. Occasionally some items appear to help you and these are extra balls, smart bomb, shield (limited), extra speed, freeze all bugs, extra time and stop timer.</desc>

		<desc>Insects in Space is a side-scrolling shooter with similarities to Defender. Insects killed everyone on Earth except a few babies. This causes the mystical leader of motherhood, St. Helen, to travel to Earth's remains and save the babies. The most important feature of this protagonist is the fact that she is topless and - as prominently mentioned in the manual - "big breasted", but she controls and shoots just like the space ship normally found in those games. The levels are side-scrolling and St. Helen can move in both directions. Additionally the levels are two screens high, the lower with a floor and the higher with a ceiling, which can be changed by leaving the current screen to the top respectively bottom. The babies are either positioned at the top or bottom level and are hunted by bees. Those bees pick them up, steal their life energy to create a new monster and drop them to the ground to die. The player's job is to kill the bees and save the babies. To help, a radar shows where in the level a kidnapping is in progress. Babies can be either returned to the ground for points or kept in Helen's grasp to convert them into power-ups eventually. Helen can also summon a dust cloud which teleports her near a bee target.</desc>

The goal obviously is to reach the top of the league which is achieved by winning matches against other teams. If the own team has possession of the puck, the player can start a shot by holding the fire button - the longer kept, the more power goes into the shot. When in defense, the player can choose between two control methods: either manual cycling through the athletes or the game automatically switches to the one nearest to the puck. Other options include the strategy (athlete positioning), three difficulty levels, the time per period (two, five or twenty minutes) and if the highlights of the game should be replayed after each third. Offside and icing are ignored.</desc>

Real teams are provided at both club and national level - although, contrary to what the packaging claimed, the player names are invented. The players vary in speed, and in which skills (such as heading, overhead kicks, close control and shooting) they are competent in. Running with the ball generally works better than passing. Plenty of tournaments are offered, as is the chance to edit team data and kits. One advantage it has over the original Sensible Soccer is onscreen referees and linesmen.</desc>

		<name>International Sports Challenge</name>
		<desc>A International sports challenge rghhh! Just as the dust was clearing after the stampede of footy games, it is time for the Olympics and the inevitable onslaught of athletics games. Lucky for Empire, their International Sports Challenge has two things going for it Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it is the first one out, and it has got some weird events in it. Sure it has got the usual dose of joystick waggling (in the swimming and cycling events), but among the six events (okay, so it is not exactly a full Olympic sim) are show jumping, and Ã¢â‚¬â€œ yes! Ã¢â‚¬â€œ skeet shooting Ã¢â‚¬â€œ always one of my faves on the sports games of yesteryear.

It is possible to play each event individually, but of course these games are all about doing the entire thing, preferably competing against a friend of two. The formula for the whole lot goes something like this Ã¢â‚¬â€œ diving, shooting, cycling, swimming and show jumping are all played as in-between events, with a strategy- based marathon even enveloping them all. This marathon does not require a single joystick waggle, instead requiring players to balance rhythm with speed, top-up energy, avoid dehydration, all that kind of stuff.

The lack of events is partially compensated for by the gameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s flexibility, with several variations in each event upping lastability and game time. Empire reckon there are 2000 event variations to try out, and while I doubt you would want to try out every single combination, International Sports Challenge offers a decent amount of fun for yer money, for a team of players at least. I have got my doubts about its value as a single player game though, and the water events really are tedious. But at least it tries to be a little different, and anyway, I am a sucker for multiplayer games.</desc>

The player is Chad, a DreamTrack Dreamer who has discovered that Dreamtrack Corporation is using the DreamTracks to destroy people's minds. He decides to break into Dreamtrack HQ. To overcome the high-tech security systems, his girlfriend, Kaf-E, agrees to break into the building physically, while Chad enters a virtual reality world, inspired by Neuromancer, in order to hack into and disable the computer-controlled defences.

The action mostly takes place in two modes: a 3D cyberpunk environment and a 2D schematic map where puzzles are encountered. 3D objects in the cyberpunk environment represent objects such as security doors and cameras. To disable the real-world devices, the 3D objects must be destroyed. Puzzle-solving involves determining which objects to disable and in what order. The player must also deal with virtual defences, represented by enemy ships which pose a threat to the player's ability to jack in to the system, and which must be defeated.</desc>

		<desc>Into the EagleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Nest is a top-down action game, much like the old arcade classic, Gauntlet. As you may have guessed from the title however, EagleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Nest is a World War II based game, and concerns the heroic deeds of an Allied Commando, fighting hordes of German Stormtroopers. The graphics are bold and colourful, and the characters themselves are much larger than those in similar games like the Gauntlet and Garrison series, or indeed those from Alien Breed.

Using the joystick you guide your character through the maze of corridors in the castle, finding various useful objects like ammunition, keys, health, elevator passes, etc. You will frequently see a long line of Germans lined up in an adjacent corridor, just waiting for you to unlock a connecting door, which will allow them to attack you.

Unfortunately though, the game, which promises to be a fun and action filled romp, fails to deliver and will probably be abandoned after only a few minutes of play. The problem is one of tedium. Its just dull. Very little skill is required to massacre huge numbers of the enemy soldiers, and simply standing your ground and holding the fire button is usually sufficient to pack droves of them off to the great Reich in the sky. The sound is very limited, and the scrolling is somehow reminiscent of an early Psygnosis game; highly dodgy, and apparently not making efficient use of the AmigaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s purpose built hardware.

I may have missed some source of appeal within the game, but I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see what. Its just so lacking in inspiration. In short, avoid the game - unless you feel you simply have to witness it for yourself.</desc>

		<name>Iron Lord</name>
		<desc>After fighting all manner of heathens in the Holy Land for the last five years, the last thing a knight wants is to come home and find his father, the king, been overthrown by his wicked uncle. Fear and oppression rule the land. Iron Lord from UbiSoft, which has taken literally years to complete, puts the player in just that situation. Your wicked uncle has gathered an army of hideous monsters and is reported to be about to mount an offensive against the normally peaceful province you call home.

Like a typical Cinemaware game, Iron Lord is a type of graphic adventure interspersed with arcade games. The adventure side of things has you riding your horse from one location to another, towns to castles to big houses, stopping off at the place and then entering various buildings and interacting with the people encountered. During this phase of the game the screen is divided into three sections. The left side of the screen shows a picture of the town you are in, while the top right gives you an aerial view of the town. Your character is represented by a small animated person viewed from above which you move around and into buildings (well, stand outside and press fire and you enter). Below this window, pieces of text appear giving you info on what is going on.

The pictures are all well drawn and the small animated window works fine. Some very nice touches include the horse galloping across the screen whenever you move from location to location. Well presented graphically and the sound effects complement it. Very nice. The arcade sub-games are no push over, so it will take a while to mater them. The overall game task is also large and becomes more convoluted the further you get into the game. This will keep you going for some little while.

The arcade bits are tough and add variety while the main quest in the game is well thought out and entertaining. It does tend to get a little repetitive due to the smallness of the game area, but overall it is not half bad and can get quite involving.</desc>

		<desc>Transport on Quad bikes is the only available form of transportation in a post nuclear disaster world, and it is your occupation. It is very dangerous, and you need to survive racing from city to city. Equipping your Quad with different weapons and engines, you should choose your route and traverse swamp roads, inner city streets, and forest tracks to complete your mission. In your quest you will encounter Mutant Appendages that will drag you into the murky depths of the swamp; fences, walls, barriers, and traps which you must avoid; primitive natives, and wild animals; police vehicles and Urban Warriors who will stop at nothing to catch and kill you. The game is third-person racing action arcade, where the player controls a Quad and shoots the enemies with the weapon chosen for it. Gameplay is available for one or two players. In two players mode the screen is split on two sides, and each player may play in cooperative or competitive mode.</desc>

		<name>Ishar 2 - Messengers Of Doom</name>
		<desc>The sequel to Ã¢â‚¬ËœIshar: Legend Of the FortressÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ takes up the story long after the destruction of Krogh, by Aramir and his companions - including KroghÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own mother, the witch Morgula! The former Fortress of Ishar became the new growth epicentre for the Aborean archipelago - The Isle of Kendoria and diverse islands named after JarelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s companions where another evil lord arose - Shandar. Zubaran, IsharÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s current Ruler,  hears of this. So, naturally, Shandar must be found and destroyed. This is the ultimate object of the game.

The SilmarilsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ standard of graphics and gameplay is sustained, and in parts improved upon, in this evolved creation of a larger and more involved fantasy world. Additions to this game include the introduction of topography. There is a greater variety of characters and creatures and everything is, again, nicely drawn, but the animation remains Ã¢â‚¬ËœstaticÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.

You start out alone, broke etc., but you have the option of using your team from Ã¢â‚¬ËœIshar 1Ã¢â‚¬â„¢. There is a map in this game which, unlike its predecessor, actually shows your position, plus indications of places to go/avoid. This sequel does rely more heavily on precursive tasks, and, unfortunately in this way, does tend towards the linear - but, not in an obvious, precognitive, or boring, way.

Overall? Quite a romp! Escapist adventure, or what?! Less uneventful/aimless wandering than either predecessor, but you need an eagle-eye to pick up on some things, even from the start. Difficulty level?  Not novice, you need a bit of experience.  Not as dull/predictable/frustrating/unimaginative as one or two other RPGs I could mention. Have fun!</desc>

		<name>Ishar 3 - The Seven Gates of Infinity</name>
		<desc>It does not matter whether you are a paragon of saintly goodness or the personification of demonically malignant evil. If you crave security, you need some form of insurance policy. Especially if you happen to be in the business of malicious wizardry and have set your twisted mind on getting the fair of people of the mightiest kingdom in Ishar under your ghastly thrall. Shandar, the malevolent sorcerer anti-hero of the piece, was defeated and banished but he took out an insurance policy in the shape of a third party planetary fire and conjunction clause. Yes, as soon as two of the moons, the sun and the planet Ishar align, Shandar can cash in his policy and transfer his spirit to the body of a Black Dragon with a name that sounds like Weetabix. Of course, this horrible scenario can be thwarted if you turn up at the right place and time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ time travel features heavily throughout the game. Seven different eras and key plot points await visitation.

The engine driving the game is the same as the previous two Ishars - lots of mouse clicks and traipsing around to gain money, arms, armour, spells, character interaction, combat and stuff.

Gripes aside, Ishar 3 is still recommended. Especially if you are a fan of either of the previous incarnations. The same criticism applies to the actual mechanics of the gameplay Ã¢â‚¬â€œ most of your time is spent traipsing around looking for fights to gain money before you can access the meat of the game in the form of puzzle solving and evil monster beating. But, if that is the sort of thing you like, then Ishar 3 delivers brilliantly. Final verdict: A miasmic mish mash of apocryphal Tolkiesm, cut and paste plagiarism, hack and slash institutionalism and engagingly evil endeavours.</desc>

		<name>Ishar - Legend Of The Fortress</name>
		<desc>The first game in the series came out in 1992 on Amiga, Atari ST and DOS. It takes place on the island of Kendoria. At the beginning, the player controls a warrior called Aramir, and he must defeat Krogh, an evil sorcerer who has killed lord Jarel. The game takes its name from Krogh's fortress, Ishar, whose name means "unknown" in the game's fictional elf language. In order to achieve this, the player's characters must travel across the whole island and, among other things, meet with the surviving companions of Jarel.

Most of Ishar takes place in an outdoor environment, which was original for computer roleplaying games of the time. It also featured a unique system to change the lineup of player characters: the player can have up to five characters at the same time, but each one will like or dislike his comrades. These preferences come into play when the player tries to recruit or dismiss a character, because the other characters will then vote for or against the recruitment or dismissal. If a character cannot be dismissed by a vote, it is possible for the player to have him assassinated by another character, but there is a risk that other characters will murder the murderer himself, possibly creating a chain of murders that slays the whole party but one.

This opus was the only one of the series that had gold removed from the party each time the player saved.

The band Summoning used the cover art of the game for their album Minas Morgul.</desc>

The objective is to place all of the tiles onto the board and obtain the highest possible score by following specific rules of play. There are ways to play that can dramatically increase the score, which makes the game very strategic in nature. Additionally, when desired, the player can get an oracle reading by asking a question, which is answered when the player makes a very elegant play (four-way match). 

There is also a "construction set" where players can create their own tiles and backgrounds. The game comes with numerous tile sets and backgrounds.</desc>

The player plays the part of Dr. Greg Bradley, a geologist and the newest resident in town. Eager to satisfy his scientific mind, Bradley sets out to examine the crash-site of a mysterious meteor, but what he finds is not at all what he had been looking for.

The game takes place all over Lizard Breath, and there are several different types of action / interaction. The adventure part of the game is very linear, guiding the player in a fairly set sequence of action sections. These include first-person bug shooting, scrolling overhead shooting, and a chase sequence.</desc>

		<desc>James Pond, also known as James Pond: Underwater Agent, is a platform video game that was developed by British video game developers Vectordean Ltd and Millennium Interactive, and published by Millennium Interactive and Electronic Arts for numerous home computers and consoles in 1990. The character was popular and even featured in some comic books of the time, and the game was successful enough to spawn two sequels and one spin-off game.

A nefarious supervillain named "Doctor Maybe" (a pun on the name of Dr Julius No, the villain in Dr. No) has overtaken the ruthless megacorporation Acme Oil Co, and is not only filling the oceans with radiation and toxic waste but even threatening all the world from his underwater lair. The protagonist of the story and player character of the game is an intelligent, mutated anthropomorphic mudskipper who is given the name "James Pond" (after the legendary spy James Bond) and hired by the British Secret Service to protect the seas and take out the bad guys in underwater areas. He is also suave enough to seduce numerous attractive mermaids, some of whom act as double agents as is common with James Bond's love interests. The game spoofs James Bond movies with levels mimicking their titles, with level names like "License to Bubble" (after Licence to Kill), "A View to a Spill" (after A View to a Kill), "Leak and Let Die" (after Live and Let Die) and "From Three Mile Island with Love" (after From Russia with Love).</desc>

As you explore the 150-plus screens of the game, you must shoot the other fish - some can be shot using your standard weapon, while others (those which flash) must be shot using special limited bullets.

You also have responsibility for closing beaches, which removes the risk of a shark attack, but also costs the area business, especially on hot days, and irritates the Mayor.</desc>

		<desc>Jet Set Willy II: The Final Frontier is a platform game released by Software Projects for a variety of home computers. It was the only official sequel to Jet Set Willy, one of the most successful and popular home computer games ever released. Officially, Jet Set Willy II: The Final Frontier is the last of the Miner Willy series, although numerous unofficial sequels, remakes, homages and updates have been released, even up to this day.

Jet Set Willy II is an expansion of the original JSW rather than a new game unto itself. Its map is primarily an expanded version of the original mansion, with only a few new elements over its predecessor, several of which are based on rumoured events in JSW that were in fact never programmed (such as being able to launch the titular ship in the screen called "The Yacht" and explore an island). In some versions Willy is blasted from the Rocket Room into space, and for these 33 rooms he dons a spacesuit.</desc>

		<name>Jetsons - The Computer Game</name>
		<desc>The definition of a game as defined in the Oxford dictionary is Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ1. an amusement or pastimeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ or Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ2. a contest with rules, the result being determined by skill, strength, or chanceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Bearing these in mind one wonders whatever possessed the Hi-Tec peeps to release this with the word Ã¢â‚¬ËœgameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ anywhere on the disk or packaging. Fair enough it does pass the time, but then so does a party political broadcast. This, not to put too fine a point on it, is pretty tedious stuff indeed.



Initial impressions are more favourable, however. You canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t deny The Jetsons looks pretty much like youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d expect Hanna-BarberaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family of second- string cartoon characters to look, but decent-enough- cartoony-graphics is about as far as its list of good points goes. To be honest, the list of bad points is equally short - thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no gameplay to speak of here at all. All that happens is, one after another, members of our 1950s-style space family explore a boring space-age maze, dodging dull traps and picking up the odd even-more-boring collectables. Obviously Hi-Tec thought that the graphics and animation were ample to sell this as a Ã¢â‚¬ËœgameÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and, indeed, I dare say theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll sell quite a few on the name alone. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let one of them be you - not least because theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got the cheek to charge a distinctly un-budget thirteen quid for it.</desc>

They were swiftly halted in their tracks when they received a top level order warning of a massive campaign of bribery of government officials in all countries. It appeared that any overt attempt to destroy SPUDD would result in the downfall of most of the world's governments. SPUDD-controlled leaders would soon rise to replace them.

Jetstrike is an 2D side-scrolling action game like BrÃƒÂ¸derbundÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Wings of Fury. The great difference between these games is, in Jetstrike itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s possible to use 32 aircraft and 6 helicopters in several combat-missions or to be a part of the Aerolympics.</desc>

		<desc>Aquatania has recently become the land of misfortunes, due to a group of plotting witches. The task of finding five charms and a magic bracelet to put things right falls on you.

And you need a change of luck, because events in this game often emphasise the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. You get hit by a car, fall a great height, sprayed with cheese sandwich and more! Being the guinea pig in this strange world will drive you insane - if this jinxed land doesn't do it first. 

Jinxter is an interactive fiction with graphics title that takes a realistic world of people and situations, and then plays with the boundaries to create a strange and puzzling world. Characters are all getting on with their own tasks, and getting them to help you is usually a case of making sure something's in it for them.

Dialogue aims to add a comic touch to proceedings. Puzzles can often be solved in multiple ways, but the most obvious way is not always the correct one. Due to the presence of a Guardian, you can't actually die.</desc>

		<name>Joe Blade II</name>
		<desc>As Players Software correctly predicted, London in 1995 is an unfriendly unsafe city ran by thugs. Innocent civilians who leave the house will almost certainly face violence. An acclaimed hero since his successes in the original, Joe Blade is the man to put things right - if he can kill 100 thugs and rescue 20 civilians within ten minutes, the thugs will retreat and the city will be saved.

As Joe, you must move through the streets and kill these thugs, by kicking them in the head (they have body armour). As in the first game, the streets are flick-screen and have many doorways linking them. Rescuing civilians involves touching them before completing a sub-game within a minute.

There are four subgame variants of increasing difficulty, all based around a 1-2-3-4 sequence of numbers. The first involves simply stopping the cursor as each one appears in order - pressing the wrong one sends you back to having to find a 1. In the second, the numbers are on screen in random order, a cursor cycling through them - press fire to swap the two numbers currently highlighted. In the third, you are presented with two jumbled sets and must put one of them in order, by swapping numbers across the two sets. In the fourth, you must form the sequence by swapping an ever-changing number into the right place, by pressing fire at the right moment.</desc>

The bombs are deactivated by arranging letters into alphabetical order, but the bulk of the gameplay involves shooting and maze navigation.

To aid the Judge you have various weapons to fire and also your Lawmaster bike. This allows you to move around faster but you can't fire your weapon or arrest people thus making the crime rate rise.

		<desc>A remake of the Commodore 64 games Trailblazer and Cosmic Causeway, Jump ?N' Roll involves guiding a rendered spherical object through a succession of landscapes. There are theoretically more than 9 levels; I say ?theoretically? because the 9th one appears to be impossible. The landscapes are always 5 squares wide, and while many of these are just standard squares, there are several different types, differentiated by colour. There are black holes which cause the ball to drop, costing you valuable time, although you get a limited number of jumps on each level, which are accessed by pressing fire. Yellow squares speed the ball up, while red slows it down. Green causes the ball to stick and be immovable until it clears that section, purple reverses the left and right control, while blue gives a free jump (be careful not to miss the next jump pads while in the air though). Points are given depending on how far you progress in each level, and how quickly you complete it.</desc>

		<desc>Some time after Operation Desert Strike, Ibn Kilbaba, son of Kilbaba S.R, threatens to annihilate America. After his father was killed, the people who were under his control, sent his son running off, along with his father's money and nuclear weapons program. Kilbaba, more ruthless than his father, longs for revenge of his father's death and decides to shed the blood of those who killed him, the Americans. Already armed, Kilbaba hires Carlos Ortega to help him set up his Nuclear Weapons program, deep in South America. Carlos Ortega, the world's most notorious druglord, also yearns to seek revenge. With his own private army, armed with the most hi-tech weapons, he's ready to fight America at all costs. 

Because of this threat, you're hired again to battle these two characters, following their paths in the jungles of South America. Armed with the Commache, numerous other vehicles, and destructive weapons, you must take out their private army. Blow up the enemy with your hellfires, hydras, chain guns. Use the watercraft to launch mines at enemy ships. Pull off a drive-by on the enemy with guns on the side. Take out the evil duo and forever rid this threat.....in the jungle!</desc>

		<name>Jupiter Probe</name>
		<desc>Your mission in Jupiter Probe, the latest release from Microdeal is to fly above the surface of Jupiter sending back photographs. However, a hostile race of beings whose only desire is to destroy Earth is trying to stop you from discovering the dark secrets of Jupiter.

The mightiest powers on Earth have united and supplied three scout ships with which to scour the surface of Jupiter. These ships are equipped with twin laser cannons and a limited number of 'advanced features'. These advanced features are Ultrasonics, which cause a disturbance in the area around your ship, thus destroying all aliens in your vicinity, and Shields which protect your craft from enemy fire for a short period of time.

As you can probably tell from the above, this is yet another shoot Ã¢â‚¬Ëœem up game. In fact it is very much like many other games of this type. Vertical scrolling, nice bold graphics, neat soundtrack, lots of aliens and plenty of action. The many craters, mountains, rivers (on Jupiter!!!?) and ground bases are all well drawn and very colourful, however they appear to be very 'chunky'. The sound is, in most respects, excellent.

The game is very playable as it is just about the right difficulty level for most people, making it fairly hard but not impossibly so. Control is with either mouse, joystick or keyboard. Jupiter Probe is a good value for money game, the price being something which I hope to see more often from both Microdeal and other software companies.</desc>

Weapons which can throw a car off course are commonplace, as are short cuts and speed-boosting pads (which do not always follow a conventional racing line). As well as the races, there are timed money-collecting bonus duels on enclosed circuits.

You are one of the competitors, either in single races or a full season. Money is won for results, and collected as it lies on track. This can be spent on improvements such as engine and armor upgrades, as well as more powerful races.</desc>

The game starts just after the T-Rex pushes the visitor's van into it's pit. You play the role of Dr. Alan Grant, so you have to find Tim and Lex, take them to the Visitor's center and get everybody out of the island. But this time it won't be half as easy as it was on the movie.

The game is split in two missions, played in two different ways. The first mission is to take Tim and Lex back to their grandfather and is (almost exclusively) played from a top-down perspective. The second mission involves getting the power back on line and returning alive, so everybody can leave the island and is played like a FPS (First Person Shooter).</desc>

The early medieval setting and fantasy themes resemble "Asterix &amp; Obelix".

Kajko i Kokosz is a classic point &amp; click adventure game, based on a popular Polish comic book series featuring the same characters. You can switch between the two characters at will, and some actions have to be done with a specific character. The controls are pretty simple - to interact with the environment, you just have to click. You have a limited space in your inventory, but you can take an object from your inventory and drop it anywhere at any time. The game graphics feature original artwork created by the creator of the series, Janusz Christa, thus retaining the "look &amp; feel" of the comic books.</desc>

		<desc>The Karate Kid: Part II - The Computer Game is a one-on-one fighting game based on the movie The Karate Kid: Part II. The storyline of the movie is not directly addressed; the player only participates in five fights based on movie scenes. The difficulty rises from fight to fight.

The player uses the input device to perform a multitude of moves, kicks and strokes. When changing direction (e.g. after jumping over the opponent) the controls reverse. Every successful hit drains the opponent's energy and improves the high score - the opponent tries to do the same to the player, of course. Between fights there are two mini games with digitized movie images: either catching flies with chopsticks (basically a reaction game) or breaking an ice block with bare hands (building up enough force by joystick wiggling).

The two-player mode is basically the same, only that the second player takes the role of Daniel's opponent. The last fight is not played and the mini games between fights are played by both players in turns.</desc>

Tracks can be raced in the wet, dry or on ice - don't forget to alter the tyre selection to suit. Contact with other cars weakens these tyres and can eventually cause punctures. Each race is of a varying number of laps depending on the track's length and complexity. Sound effects have been sampled, giving the game a realistic sound unusual at the time.</desc>

		<name>Kennedy Approach</name>
		<desc>The player assumes the role of a controller in a Terminal Radar Approach Control, giving instructions to aircraft so that they can safely land, as well as take off and enter their correct flight corridors. The purpose of the game is to manage the flights that are presented to the player without the flights being delayed or exiting/landing in the wrong location. The aircraft either come flying in on the screen and have preset exit or landing points or show up as wanting to take off with an exit point. It is the player's job to determine the route each aircraft flies and when they may land or take off.

The aircraft cannot be too close to each other, so the player needs to make sure that they are passing each other on different flight levels or with sufficient distance (three grid dots north/south or east/west) between them. When an aircraft is in danger of crashing or is exiting at the wrong location or altitude, the aircraft will inform the air traffic controller. Aircraft do not change course/altitude unless the player tells them to. Incoming aircraft not given clearance to land, however, will go into a holding pattern and wait until given clearance. When necessary, the player can also give holding instructions to aircraft, as long as their course takes them over a VOR tower which is used as the holding fix.

To start with, there are few flights at the same time, but at higher GS levels, there are many flights that need management at the same time. Also storms which the aircraft can not pass through show up and some aircraft have very little fuel and have to land fast or they will crash.</desc>

		<desc>Set in the same world as Magic Candle, and using a modified engine from said game. This is a single player RPG more aimed at a novice. Your job is to clear out all the monsters infesting the cellars, dungeons and dark corners of Maramon.

You can chose your character at the beginning of the game. You can be either a huntsman, blacksmith, courier or a scholar. Each has slightly different abilities and all come in handy at some point. You start in the town of Maramon where you are the local sheriff, you might say. Your job is to protect the town from the monsters that come out at night. You can go to different locations, but I suggest you go and equip yourself first - so buy some weapons and armor. Both cost money, but youll get paid on a regular basis for providing your services. Also, and conveniently, monsters will leave little money pouches behind. But where do all these ¢ monsters come from? They come from the very towers that are in the city! Each night the monsters stream from one tower to cause mayhem in the town. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a tip: they always attack the same target on the same day. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your job to stop and kill them before they kill you - or anyone else.

This game is best described as the ¢ version of far better-known Magic Candle series. Mindcraft seems to be targeting the RPG newbies with simplified RPG engine and statistics-- instead of 4 characters, now you control only one. Combat and spellcasting are also not terribly exciting. Still, like OriginÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tangled Tales, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a commendable (and underappreciated) effort to expand the RPG market.</desc>

Each player on the pitch has a unique combination of 4 attributes, namely Pace, Stamina, Accuracy and Aggression. As you progress you will need to adapt to to different types of players. You can play in a league consisting of 8 teams. The teams in the league are on the whole evenly matched but have different styles of play with players attribute to match that style.

The game now features full tournament modes (although the players on the teams are fictitious) and four different pitches (including an implementation of plastic pitches, whose uneven bounce cause controversy when several British clubs tried them in the 1980s).

Viewed top-down, the controls involve trapping the ball under your foot, giving you time to prepare passes. Running with the ball is tricky at first, as it doesn't stick to your foot the way it did in contemporary football games. Complex moves such as overhead kicks, back-heels and long-range through-ball passes can be completed with practice.</desc>

		<name>Kick Off 3</name>
		<desc>Finally, after literally months of hype and guesswork, Kick Off 3 itself is finally available, and I can honestly tell you that a lot of people are going to be very, very surprised. Gone is the top view. Gone is the scanner. Gone are the extremely fiddly ball handling controls, and in comes a game that is far more traditional in terms of soccer gameplay than the previous two Kick Off games.

From the outside in, the first thing you are confronted with is the choice of games to play. You can either work through the standard friendly or league matches, or take part in The Challenge where you go against 30 other teams, one by one, until you reach the Anco All Stars at the end of the game. Plus, just to be a little topical, you can take part in the World Cup, from the qualifying rounds onward.

The game is viewed in the classic Ã¢â‚¬Ëœside-onÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ view Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a view that was previously dropped, if you can remember that far back, because it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t give the player enough information about where their players actually were on the pitch. A step backwards perhaps? Maybe, but then if the game was viewed from the top you wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the stylish animation this game possesses. Although the view might be dated, the game looks great, with large, well-drawn players and animations for every occasion. 

The question is, of course, how does it all play? The answer, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m afraid to say, isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a positive one and the controls are just too sluggish and the actual movement of the players too slow to make the game really playable. It looks great, sure, but it just doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have the responsiveness needed for a really frantic soccer game. Kick Off 3, you seem to spend most of your time fighting the controls rather than flowing with them, and that just takes all the fun out of it.</desc>

		<name>Kick Off 96</name>
		<desc>Kick Off was the first football game of its kind, having a top-down view and unlike other football games of that time, the ball was not glued to the feet of the players.

Playing Kick Off requires skills in ball control. There is an option to learn these skills without being harassed by the opposition. The set pieces like corner kicks, passing, sliding tackles and dribbling can be practiced to perfection. Each player on the pitch has a unique combination of 4 attributes, namely Pace, Stamina, Accuracy and Aggression. As you progress, you will need to adapt to different types of players. You can play in a league consisting of 8 teams. The teams in the league are on the whole evenly matched, but have different styles of play with players attribute to match that style. There is 12 different referees in the game.</desc>

		<path>./KidChaos_v1.0_1140.lha</path>
		<name>Kid Chaos</name>
		<desc>Kid Chaos is transported from the stone age into an unknown world by evil scientists from the future. Now he must fight his way through artificial environments such as the Secret Garden, Toxic Wasteland, Toy Factory, Techno Fortress, and the Ruined City to reach the time machine that can transport him back home.

Kid does this by running through the level, destroying all wildlife and several destruction targets, then leave the level by the exit door, which remain closed until Kid has destroyed all destruction targets. He destroys by swinging his club in the air and hitting them. He can also whiz if he's running fast, which enable him to discover hidden passages through walls that usually contain apples and power-ups. These are also found if Kid manages to jump really high in the air and lands on a platform that usually lead to secret passages.

There are five levels and four sections to complete in all of them (a total of twenty levels) and Kid start each level with three lives. During the level, if he loses health just by touching wildlife, or if the time expires, he is warped out of the level, loses a life, and has to restart the level at the checkpoints he passes through. His health can be restored either by waiting for the health meter to reach 99 (the boring way) or collecting apples (the smart way), but as Kid progresses further throughout the game, these apples become rare as well as his destruction targets. 

Once he leaves a level, Kid is given a statistics screen, telling him the percentage of destruction he has caused, how much wildlife he has killed, how many apples he collected, and other extras. These "extras" probably include how much more of his destruction targets he broke beyond the requirement.

As mentioned earlier, if Kid jumps really high to reach a platform, he can get power-ups, giving him such wonderful things like extra lives, extra time, or extra health. He can also collect a life token. If he manages to find three life tokens within the same section, then he is awarded an extra life as well.

Every fourth level, Kid will be faced with a challenge, and the object of these is usually to kill something, but there's always a catch for these challenges. For example, in Toy Factory, he has to shoot teddy bears at least ten times to blow them up, while avoiding shooting at ducks; and in Techno Fortress, he's presented with a game similar to Space Invaders, but only this time, there are no barriers.

Once killed most release things like tokens, keys (sometimes required to open end-of-level doors), apples (for extra energy) and occasionally poison. There are lots of semi-hidden sections and bonus areas to find and explore, including bonus arcade games and fruit machines. Every world ends with a boss.</desc>

		<desc>Although not released for 8-bit systems, this platform game has a definite Commodore 64 feel to it. Bright primary colours and smiling characters are used to tell the tale of Kid's journey to rescue his girlfriend.

The levels feature an assortment of enemies to kill, including snakes, elves and crocodiles, as well as flames and spinning wheels. Many of these appear during the level, forcing you to plan for them. You have 10 lives, but the loss of one resets the level to its original state. The initial coin-throwing is pretty weedy, but better weapons (as well as extra lives and smart bombs) can be bought in the shop, which appears every 5 screens.

The levels are flick-screen, and can usually be finished in different ways, which results in different starting positions on the next screen, and you can travel back and forth through them, for example to pick up bonuses which are visible but not accessible as the level starts.</desc>

		<path>./Kikstart2_v1.1.lha</path>
		<name>Kikstart II</name>
		<desc>Kikstart 2 is a motorcycle trials racing videogame released for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. It enjoyed more success than its predecessor, Kikstart. The game allowed 2-player simultaneous (via a split-screen facility) or 1-player, vs-computer play. The game mechanics were copied into other games too, like the Game Boy game "Motocross Maniacs".

The basic premise of the game is to control a bike using acceleration, braking, "hopping" and "wheelies" to navigate across a course of various obstacles, from ramps and gates to telephone boxes and tyres.

The game was based on the BBC Television series Kick Start. An enhanced version was released for the Commodore 128,[1] one of the few native mode game titles for that computer.

Some obstacles only allowed travel across them in certain ways. For instance, fences and wooden beams can only be navigated at low speed, without "hopping" or falling onto them. Tyres would only allow travel at high speeds, driving slowly will "throw" the rider. When a rider lands badly (i.e. with the front wheel first) or "falls off" an obstacle, they are catapulted a certain distance forward, imposing a certain time penalty because the player is not put back into the game until the screen has scrolled to a "safe" (i.e. flat) area of the course on which to restart the bike.

Players can either play against their opponent in a straight-out race to the finish post, or they can "win" by aggregated finishing times. Courses are played in sets of five, denoted by a letter of the alphabet and can be edited by the player using the built-in course designer. This allowed the user to place any obstacles on a blank track and later save and share completed courses.</desc>

		<desc>In the dark future the new brutal sports game will be invented - Killerball - a blend of American Football, Roller-Skating, and Pinball. The three leagues (Elite, Major and Minor) will differ by the level of brutality. The action takes place in a circular rink. Each team of five players should put the iron ball in the small hole of the opposite team to make a score, and do not allow the players of another team to make the same. Each team player has health indicator, which will decrease during the game, because the only way to take the ball is to knock down the opponent in any brutal way. Each match during the season has time limit, but it may be finished also if all the players of any team will be unconscious and at least one ball will be put in the hole.

The game has a training mode, where you may play a single match with a computer or another human player, and tournament mode, where eight teams controlled either by computer or human players will fight for the victory. Tournament progress may be saved and restored.</desc>

This hovers around the middle of the skyscrapers, creating a claustrophobic low level experience (and a different feel to the many other flight simulations set in the city, such as F/A-18 Interceptor). 

In this maelstrom, the Black Angel gang is terrorising the public. The player is a member of the SFPD Police force, charged with bringing them down throughout ten missions. Some are out-and-out action while others are more strategic. You can only survive for 20 minutes in the smog, so time is crucial in these missions.

In addition to outflying the enemy on your hoverbike, the player must carefully pre-position ground forces to arrest him when he is brought down, using Pick-Up Pods. Once arrested, a suspect must be interrogated to release enough information to know what the next threat is.</desc>

For the entertainment of the futuristic masses, you play a criminal that has been inserted into a mechanical body with the promise that if you succeed in surviving through all the levels (there are many and they are hard), you will be set free.
   You start each level at the bottom, near pooling liquid which will soon rise, at your immediate peril. Navigate the level from bottom to the exit at the top before the liquid rises and kills you. There are many other foes that fly around, causing you damage and basically annoying you to spit.
   Most levels must be navigated through a series of keyed gates, doors, or portals. These shaped keys are scattered around the map and must by picked up and used only on the gates they match individually.
   Twist: You can only carry one special weapon (triple shot, laser beam, or vertical shot) and one tool (key, liquid-freeze, or a red herring) at a time.
   This game requires a lot of memorization of enemy movement patterns and optimum routes.
   A unique feature is that when you die, you can watch a replay and take over at any point to continue your game.
   You can also hit the HELP button at the start of each level to view a map, helping you plan your route.</desc>

The planet you are heading for is uninhabitable after a giant brain that controlled all life became extinct, but as you approach the surface it becomes clear that this isn't true as you are attacked by various life-forms.

Killing Machine is a top down vertically scrolling shooter where the screen scrolls upwards constantly as you attempt to shoot or avoid various aliens and vehicles over three levels. Getting touched or shot loses you one of three lives and sent to the start of the level you are playing. Certain objects when shot leave behind a power-up which gives you better weapons or a shield which is limited and if you lose a life then you lose your power-up. At the end of level one or two you face a huge Brain Guardian which needs destroying to move to the next level. At the end of the third level is the Giant Brain itself.</desc>

With Al Capone out of the picture, Chicago's prohibition-era profit is up for grabs. Are you merciless and cunning enough to gain it by whatever means are required? Every action you take has complex long-term consequences which are not always obvious at the time.

You must keep your people on your side, watching what you say and do, knowing that an overthrow could be hatched at any moment. Look after your woman as well - who's going to respect a single mobster? The money has to be juggled in these ways, not forgetting to reach an 'understanding' with the Mayor to avoid any negative attentions.</desc>

		<desc>As a knight, paladin, barbarian or sorceress, amass an army of creatures to take on the local baddies and search for the Sceptre of Order.  A turn based game with a time limit that decreases depending on the skill level you play at.

Depending on your allegiance, you will initially start with a different set of creatures, though the king will not mind whether you're his knight or barbarian. Game consists of four maps, each with more mean creatures to control and meaner opponents to fight, but acquiring those maps early will let you find and buy some mean creatures that will help you easily conquer prior maps.

You can see all the enemies on the map and can literally clear the map of enemies, though random can appear in your castles if you leave them unprotected after the conquest. With each conquered castle (assuming the castle is occupied by the enemy you are currently after), you will get a level up, after first two level-ups king will promote you and you'll be able to recruit cavalries from the castle, after four more promotions you'll be able to recruit knights. All the other creatures are found outside the king's castle and can be recruited no matter the level, although your level determines the quantity of creatures you can find for recruitment, but take care of your money because if you don't have enough for your army's salary, they will desert or turn against you.

There are also two artifacts per each map that will also uncover the map of the place holding the King's Sceptre. The moment you find the sceptre and bring it back to the king, the game will end even if you happen to find it very early in the game.

As for tougher enemies, like the final one having hundreds of dragons and demons, they can also be defeated, but not by the army you can muster in one go. But when you're defeated, you respawn back at the king's castle and start with almost nothing but your money, however, the enemy in the castle will be left without those creatures lost in the battle, unless some of the new comes to aid him as every week the population increases.</desc>

		<name>King's Quest II : Romancing the Throne</name>
		<desc>After having recovered the three treasures, King Graham has been crowned king. Now having needing a queen for companionship, Graham searches the land for a maiden, but to no avail, so he turns to the magic mirror for help. The mirror shows him a beautiful girl locked away in a quartz tower in a faraway land of Kolyma, and must find three keys that are used to unlock the door that will lead to her. 



King's Quest II: Romancing the Throne is a graphic adventure game. As is typical for Sierra's AGI games, players move Graham around with arrow keys and perform actions by typing commands in the interface, which are usually combination of verbs and nouns. The game is similar to its predecessor in structure and gameplay system. Like Daventry, Kolyma is a large cyclical world consisting of interconnected screens. Compared to the first game, it is bigger and busier, with more locations and places of interest. Puzzles follow a similar format; knowledge of fairy tales is advisable for solving some of them, and complex solutions grant the player more points than a brute force approach possible in some cases.</desc>

		<name>King's Quest III : To Heir is Human</name>
		<desc>King Graham and Queen Valanice had two children, Alexander and Rosella, and the kingdom was once peaceful. It wasn't long until Alexander was snatched from his crib and things started to take a turn for the worse. A three-headed dragon threatens the ever-peaceful Daventry, and requires a maiden to be sacrificed every year. Rosella is the chosen one.



Meanwhile, in a secluded house atop a mountain in the land of Llewdor, the evil wizard called Manannan keeps a young lad named Gwydion as his slave, forcing him to do menial tasks as he prepares his spells and observes the country through his telescope. Gwydion must find a way to outsmart the wizard, escape, and eventually discover the truth about his own identity.



King's Quest III: To Heir is Human is an adventure game similar in basic gameplay mechanics to its predecessor The player navigates Gwydion with arrow keys and interacts with the environment by typing verb and noun combination commands. Llewdor consists of interconnected screens that loop once the player character reaches the border of the land. Throughout the course of the game, Gwydion will also travel to other locations and have a magic map at his disposal, allowing him to teleport to different areas. 



There are more items to collect in this installment, and more complex actions required to execute, raising the difficulty level. A large part of the game proceeds in real time, with Mannanan following his own schedule, forcing the player to plan and time his actions. There is also a time limit imposed on the game's first major quest.</desc>

		<name>King's Quest 4 - The Perils Of Rosella</name>
		<desc>King Graham and Queen Valanice were glad to have their children back. Graham thinks that it is time to pass onto them his old adventurers' hat. When he throws it across the room, he suffers a heart attack and collapses on the floor, and he is carried off to bed. The only way that Graham's health can be restored is by retrieving the magic fruit in the faraway land of Tamir. A beautiful fairy called Genesta offers Rosella the chance to be transported to the land, and find the fruit. But once she gets transported, she cannot be sent back unless she helps the fairy regain her talisman that was stolen by the evil witch, Lolotte. 



King's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella is the first game in the series to have a female protagonist. Rosella will meet characters that will either help or hinder her. The player moves Rosella around with arrow keys, and have her perform actions by typing commands. Unlike the previous King's Quest games, which used the AGI engine, this installment uses the new SCI engine with more detailed graphics; the most visible effect is that the game is paused while the player is typing, giving unlimited time to complete even the longest commands. An AGI version of the game, however, was released as well.</desc>

		<name>King's Quest V : Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder</name>
		<desc>On a beautiful sunny day, King Graham of Daventry decides to take a stroll in the woods surrounding his castle. When he returns, he discovers with horror that his home, Daventry Castle, has completely disappeared! Graham is at a loss, and wonders how this could have happened, when a talking owl named Cedric appears. He tells him that he saw the whole thing, and that an evil wizard named Mordack whisked the entire castle away, along with Graham's family in it. Cedric offers to take him to his homeland, Serenia, where his master, the wizard Crispin resides. Surely Crispin will be able to help King Graham rescue his family from Mordack's clutches.



King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder is an adventure game, and the first from Sierra to use a point-and-click mouse interface. Rather than typing commands on a keyboard to interact with the game world and use the arrow keys to walk around, King's Quest V instead simplifies all actions down to base commands. To access the different cursors, the player can move the mouse to the top of the screen, revealing a hidden menu with each of the different actions, as well as game options and the inventory bag. By clicking the "Walk" cursor on the screen, Graham will walk as close as he can to the appropriate area. Clicking the "Eye" cursor on items will provide a description, the same as typing "Look at". The "Hand" cursor is a multipurpose cursor that can be used to push, pull, interact with and pick up objects. The "Head" cursor is used to talk to people (and in the strange world of King's Quest, often objects and animals, too). Players can also right-click to cycle through the different available cursors. Inventory that Graham picks up now gets placed into a bag. By clicking on the bag, this opens up a sub-window that displays all the inventory that Graham currently has. In here, players can look at or interact with objects, combine them with other objects, or pick them up to use them in the game environment as another cursor.</desc>

		<name>King's Quest VI : Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow</name>
		<desc>For months Prince Alexander of Daventry has shut himself away from the world, thinking only of Princess Cassima, who he met while imprisoned in the previous game. Eventually he can take it no longer, and he hires a ship to search for the Land of the Green Isles located on the edge of the world. After months of searching he finally sets sight upon the island kingdom, only for a freak storm to strike the ship, destroying it and leaving him the only survivor. His troubles are far from over, however, as he soon finds out that the King and Queen have passed away, the Greens Isles are on the brink of war, and his beloved Princess Cassima may even be held prisoner by the royal vizier.



Like its predecessors in the series, King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure game. For Alexander to save the Isles, he must travel between the Land's four magical islands, each based on myth and fables, and encounter people and strange beasts that will either help or hinder him. Alexander must be careful as well, because, as with all the King's Quest games, poor choices or missteps will often prove fatal for the Prince. Puzzles are solved linearly, although late in the game there are two completely different paths to take to reach the final confrontation. Like the previous game, actions are performed using a point-and-click interface with icons that represent verbs ("walk", "examine", "use", "talk", etc.)</desc>

		<name>King's Quest : Quest for the Crown</name>
		<desc>Being fairly young in gaming years, to me Kings Quest I seems very basic especially by todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s standards. But IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sure there are those of you out there who remember the good olÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ days of RPGs, having to type in the commands for your hero, spending hours trying to find another word for Ã¢â‚¬ËœwalkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ because your computer is having one of his pedantic days and waiting on eternity for each screen to load when your character moves from one area to another. Well, I bet some of the more nostalgic among you are now saying Ã¢â‚¬ËœHey, I remember those old classicsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ - and Kings Quest I is definitely one of them.

The King of Daventry is on his last legs, and you, as his favourite Knight Sir Graham, need to retrieve three missing treasures to restore Daventry to its former glory and be rewarded with the crown. For your money you get some reasonable graphics, and some nice effects such as birds tweeting in the background, monsters splashing in the moat and waterfall.

Controlling the game is relatively easy, type in whatever instruction you wish your character to carry out and the computer will either let you do this or suggest that you try something else.

If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a real RPG fan then itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth a look. The game isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t too bad, but at the moment there are far more original and impressive adventure games around, and it canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t compete with todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s high standards.</desc>

		<desc>A team of adventurers seek out four magic objects in the dungeons of Dunshelm: The Shield of Justice, the Sword of Freedom, the Cup of Life and the Crown of Glory. Equipped with these, they hope to destroy the evil Lord Fear. Treguard, the dungeon master of the Knightmare castle, appears as an oracle to help in their quest.

Knightmare is a role-playing game and the second videogame adaptation of the homonymous British television series. It is very similar to the games of the Captive series, as it was developed by the same author. As in those games the interface is mouse-based, clearly inspired by the Dungeon Master one: the left mouse-button interacts with the environment, while the right button executes character actions. Movement can be controlled by left-clicking on the movement buttons on the screen or by using the keyboard. Once a weapon or an object is equipped, clicking on it brings up a menu with its actions. Knives, for example, have a menu with "stab", "swing" and "hack". A empty hand shows a menu with "punch" and "kick". The wand shows a list of available spells.

The game allows saving at any moment, but only loads saved games through the start menu. This means that in order to load a saved game, the player has to reset the game or intentionally kill the party.</desc>

		<name>Knight Orc</name>
		<desc>Knight Orc is very different from anything you have seen before from Level 9. Their adventure system has been upgraded before, but this time it has been upgraded beyond recognition. So too have their graphics. Gone are the rather rudimentary and meaningless Ã¢â‚¬ËœrepresentationsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ replaced by Ã¢â‚¬ËœdigitisedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ pictures. Amiga owners get the best of the deal here, for there is more colour per picture on that machine than the others Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including the Atari ST.

But it is the mode of play that has changed most dramatically. No longer do you have to make a map, and slavishly follow it move by move to return to a place you have visited earlier. No longer do you have to remember where you dropped an object that you may need later. All that is required is that you know which object you need, or which location you want to reach. If that makes playing Knight Orc sound dead simple, then forget it! To offset the ease of operation, the adventure is endowed with more than its fair share of independent characters, with minds of their own, who get in your way, grabbing the very item you are looking for, and attack you with relentless determination.

Having spent many hours playing this game I must admit that I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t actually finish it: IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not sure that I want to finish wandering about this strange new world inside my Amiga. Of all the Amiga adventures I have played this is the best - try it and see.</desc>

The Proda involves placing matching pairs of crystals in such a way that they will be charged by beams of light. 

All the while, you must play the Haresh section, to keep your family under control. This involves financial trading; getting a fair price for the goods you produce, and buying the right amounts of food, clothes and other essentials. Money must also be donated to the Tsirit.</desc>

Based on the theater play The Kristal of Konos (1976), The Kristal is primarily an adventure game with space shooter and fighting segments. The adventure portions consist of exploring populated planets, gathering clues and talking to characters in order to gain information. When traveling between planets, the player-controlled ship may be attacked be enemies, which must be eliminated in shooting sequences. Dances has special strength and psychic ratings, which may increase or decrease depending on his actions. He may participate in swordfighting to improve these parameters.

		<desc>Ask any Simpsons fan and they will tell you itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not just Bart, Lisa, Homer, Marge and Maggie that make the show worth going to a BSkyB-owning friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house to watch. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the subsidiary characters too: people like Itchy Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Scratchy, and Krusty the clown. KrustyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Super Fun House is a good-looking, nicely thought-out platform game which should be able to keep the most jaded of gamers on their toes for a while.

You move Krusty about a few platforms, each of which contains a number of doors. Simply stand outside a door, soak in the strangely menacing music, press the fire-button and in you go to one of the sub-levels. Then all you have to do is to play a kind of reverse Troddlers/Lemmings in which you have to lead a bunch of rats to their deaths at the hands of a major Simpsons character. Like Troddlers you have to make use of blocks to achieve this aim. Unlike Troddlers you have to search for these blocks along your way - and this search becomes more difficult with the later levels.

The game looks excellent, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s some great use of colour and neatly designed levels, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s let down by strange parallax scrolling and poor collision detection. Despite the moans KrustyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Super Fun House is a mightily enjoyable piece of Amiga gameplay. Once youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got over the initial amazement that Krusty himself can outleap Bob Fosbury from a standing start, you will find yourself coming back for more and more.</desc>

		<desc>Krypton Egg is a Breakout clone. Like in all such games, your goal on each level is to break all the bricks with a ball, which you bounce with a paddle, and try to save it from falling out of the level. 

Some bricks have a random power-up within them. There are many various power-ups (most beneficial, some of them harmful), such as: lengthening/shortening our paddle, enlarging or duplicating our ball, adding thrusters to the paddle so that it can fly, adding various weapons so that the paddle can shoot and destroy bricks, and many more. 

Occasionally, various monsters will appear on the playfield and begin flying around. Most of those are harmless and do nothing except interfering with the ball (if it hits them, it bounces off). However, some monsters will destroy your paddle if they touch it. 

Each few levels, there comes a special action sequence where you try to defend yourself from a horde of incoming monsters, or defeat a boss by shooting it and avoiding its missiles.</desc>

		<name>Chamber of the Sci-Mutant Priestess</name>
		<desc>Set in a post-apocalyptic world, Chamber Of The Sci-Mutant Priestess casts you as Raven, a young "Tuner" (psionic mutant), working for the Tuner Netwerk. One day, while out on assignment with his friend Sci Fi, he witnesses the massacre of a "Normal" village, by a group of Protozorqs (physical mutants). Raven and Sci Fi disobey their instructions from the Netwerk, and fight back against the Protozorqs. In the ensuing struggle, Sci Fi is captured and taken back to the Protozorqs' mountain temple. Raven vows to save her, and so gets himself captured, too. As the game starts, Raven is a prisoner in the crazy Protozorq temple, where something sinister and utterly insane seems about to happen. Apparently, Raven has to go through five ordeals, to become a "Divo" (a Messenger Of The New Solution). For each
ordeal he completes, he receives a Vort skull. Can you complete the five ordeals, save Sci Fi and destroy the fiendish Protozorq plot, in time? Luckily, you have a great array of amazing psionic powers to help you, and a neat point-and-click interface, in this unique graphic adventure.</desc>

		<desc>Dizzy must rescue four of his 'Yolkfolk' (groan) chums in this game, from Cuckoo Land, Ice Land, Cloud Land and Zak's Castle.  Like Fast Food it doesn't directly resemble the main series of arcade adventures, instead being a single-screen action game, resembling Pengo. The basic idea is to move around a maze of blocks collecting fruit, but the twist in the style is that you push the blocks in the maze to kill or trap those enemies. After every level is completed a short bonus screen appears where more fruit can be collected. During play various other tokens are released, such as bonus points, a smart bomb and control reversal.</desc>

		<desc>Laser Squad is by the same designer as Microprose's classic X-Com: UFO Defense. It brings to the table an immersive gameplay environment as well as many innovative ideas that weren't available in any other game of the time.

In Laser Squad you control a group of "marine"-like soldiers (and the occasional cyborg). Before taking them into battle, you must buy them weapons and armour with a predetermined amount of credits, taking into account the individual abilities of your squad. Unlike X-COM, the soldiers do not gain experience over time.

There are 3 missions in turn - in The Assassins you must face down Sterner Regnix and his guards, Moonbase assault challenges you to destroy the OmniCorp database, and Rescue From the Mines eschews violence in favour of a rescue mission. These are viewed from above and progress in turns. Laser Squad also features a 2-player "hotseat"-type gaming option.</desc>

The game, based on the film of the same name, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, is very different for each platform. For most of them, the gameplay can be split up into two parts: side-scrolling fighting levels and wild car chases on the streets.</desc>

On planet Bacula, a strong warrior tribe known as the Galden rose to immense military power and literally conquered all of the societies on the planet. Unsatisfied with conquering just one planet, the Galden decided to conquer a neighboring terrestrial planet, Mu. Using advanced bioships, star fighters and motor vehicles, the Galden invaded Mu, destroying many of its cities and taking the planet's ruler Queen Sheeta hostage.

The remaining royal guards of Mu are deployed in space fighters that can transform into cars to rescue the queen and crush the Galden forces.</desc>

		<desc>With the scrolls now in his possession, The Last Ninja begins training a new order of Ninja. During a training session he is mysteriously transported to XXth-century New York. The Evil Shogun has returned! Torn from his own time, The Last Ninja must defend himself once more with nothing more than the belief in his own abilities.

Last Ninja 2: Back with a Vengeance is an action/adventure game where the player, controlling a powerful ninja, must fight his way through opponents while collecting necessary items. The game is split into various levels, each of them depicting a different locale and divided into several screens. The view is isometric and the ninja can move in four different dimensions (he can also walk backwards) and jump.

Enemies, armed with fists and various ninja weapons, wander around the levels. The ninja must fight them either bare-handed or with the weaponry he finds along the way; in either case, he has a number of blows and attacks at his disposal, as well as the ability to block. There's a special weapon, shuriken, which are thrown in a straight line rather than used for melee combat; if they strike an enemy, they'll instantly kill or at least heavily damage him.

There are items scattered around the levels, such as keys, rope, a map or hamburgers (which restore health when eaten). Collecting these items and using them in a proper place is necessary for completing the game.</desc>

		<path>./LeaderBoard_v1.01_0523.lha</path>
		<name>Leader Board</name>
		<desc>Something that has always amazed me is why golf is such a popular computer conversion. The games do not feature any sequences of nail biting action, and yet on the Commodore 64, Leader Board was the top selling game in 1986. As the Amiga market is following closely in the footsteps of the 64, it is not surprising that three of the first sports conversions are golf games, although they do vary wildly in quality.

Leader Board can only really be described as an arcade golf game. It takes the basic ideas behind golf, simplifies them, and turns the game into one that depends as much on dexterity as it does on tactics.

Once loaded, Leader Board gives you the choice of how many players will take part Ã¢â‚¬â€œ between one and four Ã¢â‚¬â€œ what course you want to play on Ã¢â‚¬â€œ from the four provided Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and what level you want to play at. Provided with the minimalist British packaging, it is a comprehensive guide to both the game and the four courses, and on the Amateur level (where the ball is not affected by book, swing or wing), it is possible for even a total beginner to get round the courses without too many mistakes.

For anyone who has never played golf before, Leader Board provides an excellent introduction. It is one of the most playable sports simulations yet, and even my golf-mad dad found the game simple enough to spend a few quiet hours fiddling with the mouse. In comparison with most games on the Amiga, the graphics are not spectacular, but they are good enough to reflect all the action, and that is the most important. The sound too is uninspiring, but surprisingly the lack of audio-visual stimulation is not seen to detract too much from the game's overall enjoyment level.</desc>

		<name>Leading Lap Mpv</name>
		<desc>Hailed as a Ã¢â‚¬Å“Formula One Grand Prix beaterÃ¢â‚¬Â by new kids on the block, Kellton,  Leading Lap very nearly give the claim validity. But not quite.

Before we discuss why, let's look at what makes Leading Lap a creditable pretender to the crown. It's got a tremendous multiview 3D polygon based engine driving it and the frame rate is fast enough to ensure a smooth, believable motor racing environment. It makes use of extra memory, faster processors and FPUs with the handling of the various cars is such that if you drive too fast on a long bend the car spins out due to excessive speed Ã¢â‚¬â€œ incredibly realistic for a game which is more arcade based than simulation. Finally, the driving has a reasonably good feel to it (or a hybrid between an arcade game and a simulation)

And then there's the but. An unfortunate but, but a 'but' nevertheless. There aren't enough competitors taking part in the race - four in all. To maintain a credible sense of conflict throughout a full race, there should always be someone to press for a place, or someone pressing for a place on you. That doesn't happen with Leading Lap. Still, it's fun in a limited kind of a way to reach the giddy heights of being the winner all the time. With twelve tracks to race on it's going to take you a reasonable stretch of extended play before approaching anything like full competency.

In all, a competent, enjoyable romp. Not quite up with F1 for immediacy and out and out pace, but still good enough to convince enough people to part with their cash for a few hours of solid entertainment. If you've got an Amiga friend, try out the serial link option; it's not bad.</desc>

Leatherneck resembles Ikari Warriors - waves of soldiers move down the screen shooting at you, and you must shoot them before the bullets make contact. You are armed with grenades to take out mounted turrets, or kill a wide range of enemies at once, but watch out for enemy grenades. There are extra ammunition crates and improved weapons to pick up - waggle the joystick to toggle which one you are using.

Unusually, your shots are long-range and take effect instantly. You cannot change the direction you are facing, instead having the ability to strafe.</desc>

From an overhead perspective, the player controls MacGibbons through the corridors and rooms of the ship, scrolling in multiple directions. Despite controlling a human instead of a ship, the game is a straight shooter: using a gun to kill everything that moves while dodging enemy attacks and bullets. Getting hit reduces the energy bar and when it reaches zero, a life is lost. Special symbols give advantages when picked up, like extra time on the time limit, extra lives or weapon upgrades.</desc>

		<desc>A version of an old Norse board game called King's Table. The game has black and white teams, like chess, but each team has different pieces and a different raison d'etre. 

The white team has a total of 13 pieces, the most important one being Odin the King, who starts in the centre of the 10x10 board and moves in the same way as a chess King, whereas black has 20 pawns and four other pieces. White wins if Odin can reach one of the corner squares; black wins if it surrounds Odin on all 4 sides. The pawns actually move the same way as chess queens, but pieces are captured by surrounding them on 2 sides (although some special pieces must be surrounded on 3 sides). The specials are chosen from the selection at the start of the game, and have a variety of abilities, some 'borrowed' from chess.</desc>

		<name>Legend of the Lost</name>
		<desc>Legend of the Lost has seven levels in total, with you controlling Jack in his attempt to rescue Jane.

The intention of Legend Of The Lost is to recreate the old B-movies of the 30s. However, thanks to some dull presentation and a batch of dull sub-games, it just doesn't hold together. Graphically, the game is unimpressive, with small sprites and basic animation, and the overall impression given is one of an 8-bit game. Very average graphics. The sprite detection seems to be a bit iffy on the first level, and the game really slows down in the fifth. A tune plays while you make you way through the game, but although it's not too bad it really starts to get on your nerves after a while.

It has all the makings of a good game, but unfortunately it doesn't manage to addict you in the slightest. Each of the game's seven levels just fail to grab your attention and the only reason you continue to play, is that it is really easy and you can tell that you will probably beat it in the first day. The cartoon strip is a nice idea, but is to slow and the humor is very poor. Unfortunately, Legend of the Lost is hardly the stuff Amigas were made for.</desc>

		<name>Legend of the Sword</name>
		<desc>The game tells of the chronicles of Anar and the mystical sword and shield whose magical aura protected the inhabitants of Anar for many centuries. Time Past these items into folklore history along with the Corsarians who supposedly guarded them. Anar has now been invaded by hordes of humanoids under the control of Suxar, and rumour tells that only with the combined force of the Sword and Shield will it be possible to defeat the invaders. You and a band of loyal men volunteer to find the enchanted artifacts and take on Suxar before time runs out.

What makes Legend any different than any other adventure then? Quite simply how the game unfolds. The way the story comes to life, as you move along the map is almost akin to reading a book, and when you are asked to make a decision, invariably the words you choose will be understood. The map can be expanded to take up the whole screen if you wish, and some of the pictograms are very realistic. There are bags of humour, and a very real need to communicate effectively with the other members of your party, although when there is fighting to be done it is left to you to get on with it.

The box contains a novelette, which does contain some clues, and a poster, but what won me over in this game is Legend Of The Sword's sheer playability. It's so user friendly, and there is even a help command which kicks in without you asking it to. Go get Legend Of The Sword right now and start having a ball.</desc>

		<desc>The city of Mittledorf is in chaos - an evil cousin of the King is oppressing the people. Your cousin Sven is not evil though, so when he disappears, you head to Mitteldorf to try to track him down.

Legends of Valour is a role-playing game using a similar movement system to Ultima Underworld. You walk through the world in real time, passing texture-mapped buildings. The complex gameworld is over a mile squared and includes 40 miles of underground tunnels, as well a thousands of characters getting on with their daily business.

When designing your character, you can customise his or her looks, and this affects your likelihood of being befriended or fought. To make any inroads into finding Sven, you will need to join professional Guilds and complete quests. You have spells available to you, but will need to acquire more as the game progresses.</desc>

		<name>Legends</name>
		<desc>The premise of the Zelda style game is that a hero with a mission (rescue princess, free lands, destroy evil - that sort of thing) sets off on a voyage of discovery through different 'lands' or 'zones'. Picking up weapons along the way it ends up being a cross between a Commando style game and an adventure. Yes, you have to shoot or beat things roundly about the head with swords and like, but you also have to collect an inventory, talk to people and solve puzzles. Legends fits all of the above criteria. Give someone an object for a favour? Yes. this game is all about trading too.

Life is a precious thing in Legends. You have a certain number of continues, but there is no facility to save a game in the middle of a level, which is frustrating. One of Legends' great advantages is that you have four worlds to explore: North American, Egypt, Mediaeval, China and an additional Space Ship level. This provides major variety in terms of gameplay but it also means that once you're used to the enemies in one world everything changes in the next one and you start getting killed too easily.

Another annoying point about Legends is that the weapons are a bit weedy and the enemies are too persistent at times. This means that you can spend far too long high-tailing it out of situations without having enough chance to stand and fight, which I always find most enjoyable.

This is a step above Speris, and those who have boon searching for Zelda on an A1200 or A4000 need look no further. With various sub games, mazes and the like there is a lot of gameplay in here, and even though the various attempts at humour seem to fall flat (on me at least) it's still a fun adventure.</desc>

		<name>Leisure Suit Larry 2 Looking For Love</name>
		<desc>The opening sequence of the game finds Larry mowing the lawn of Eve, his sexual encounter from the ending of the previous game, implying the pair have remained together. However, this is quickly revealed to be an instance of an unreliable narrator, as Eve pulls into the driveway with only the vaguest recollection of who Larry is. Realising that his affair with Eve was merely a one-night stand, a distraught Larry wanders off, winning a free vacation after stumbling into a rigged game show. During his preparations for the cruise ship, a microfilm falls into Larry's hands by mistake; this attracts the attention of the KGB as well as the mad scientist Dr. Nonookee (a pun on "no nookie"), who both want to recover the film.



Sierra On-Line intentionally toned down the titular character's sexual escapades for the sequel.[2] According to series creator Al Lowe, this lack of Leisure Suit Larry's trademark humor is an oft-cited criticism of the game.[2] Throughout the adventure there are recurring themes that contribute to the comedic effect, like visitation to identical barber shops in almost each location Larry visits; one of them is tended by Rosella of King's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella.</desc>

		<desc>Passionate Patti in Pursuit of the Pulsating Pectorals! is the third game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series. Larry Laffer has finally found the woman of his dreams, and can happily live with her together on the beautiful tropical island... until he gets thrown out of the house by his wife. His boss, who happens to be his (now ex-) father-in-law, fires him. Larry is all alone, without a woman, without a job, on an island that has long ceased to be a "tropical paradise" and is exploited by entertainers, lawyers, and alike. But never despair! Dressed in his irresistible leisure suit, Larry is about to conquer the world (or at least its female population) anew. Watch out, fairer sex, because Larry is back to his swinging self!

The game uses the same text-based interface and the same graphical engine as the previous entry in the series. The structure of the game, however, is more similar to that of the first installment: most of the time, the player is confined to one large area which can be freely explored. Unlike the two previous Larry games, the player does not just control Larry, but also - in the second half of the game - the enigmatic and beautiful pianist Patti, helping them to reach an ending that will finally bring happiness into Larry's life.</desc>

		<name>Leisure Suit Larry 5 : Passionate Patti Does a Lit</name>
		<desc>Passionate Patti Does a Little Undercover Work! is (despite the number) the fourth game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series. The middle-aged would-be-womanizer Larry Laffer fell off a boat during a cruise and sustained amnesia, forgetting how he and his sweetheart Patti got separated, how Larry got a job in LA, how Patti got a job with the FBI, and what happened in (the never released) Larry 4. Now Larry and Patti are working independently on two cases that are connected to each other, even though the heroes aren't aware of that. Larry's new bosses are involved in shady business, while Patti agrees to take a break from her career as a performing pianist and become an undercover agent. Will the two be together ever again?

Unlike the previous games with their text input, Larry 5 utilizes a graphical, icon-based interface. The player uses verb commands ("Look", "Talk", "Use" etc.) to interact with the environment. In a way not quite typical for Sierra's adventure games, it is impossible to "die" in Larry 5, and the amount of "dead ends" (unwinnable situations) is greatly reduced. The game is also less puzzle-oriented, allowing the player to proceed even if he/she fails to solve the required puzzle in some cases. However, the player is awarded more points for finding the "right" solution. As in the third game, both Larry and Patti are available as playable characters during different chapters of the story.</desc>

		<desc>Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards is the first game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series, largely inspired by the text adventure Softporn Adventure.

Larry, the game's protagonist, is a short, tacky, balding, leisure suit-wearing kinda guy who's constantly searching for his next score. His combination of stupidity and brashness gets Larry into trouble. The object is to get him out of trouble in traditional adventure fashion, finding and manipulating objects as you thread your way through the story line. The content is comedic and adult-oriented. A graphical interface is used with a text parser to input commands. Typical of Sierra games, progress is tracked through a set amount of points, awarded for advancement or minor actions.</desc>

		<name>Life &amp; Death</name>
		<desc>Life &amp; Death is a game which casts you as a doctor in a hospital. Your job is to diagnose patients and administer appropriate therapies, or even perform surgery when necessary. 

To diagnose a patient, you have to press on his or her abdomen, to see which portions of the stomach cause pain. Basing on this knowledge, you can choose a therapy for him (observation, medication or referring to another specialist) or administer a X-Ray or ultrasound scan to get more information about his illness. 

In some cases, surgery will be necessary. You're the surgeon and you have to perform the operation very carefully, adhering strictly to the procedures, preserving hygiene, and maintaining care when cutting up the patient. 

Should you mistakenly administer the wrong therapy, or kill your patient at the operating table, you're kicked into the medical school, where you're given hints as to what you've done wrong.</desc>

		<desc>The aim of the game is to guide a ball through 50 levels of walls, barriers and general obstacles. You control a bat, which must 'serve' the ball into play, and then follow it through the level, deflecting it before it falls behind you, as this costs you one of your 4 lives. Initially the obstacles are all static, but moving barriers add timing, reactions and luck to proceedings.

There are also several bonus objects, which are collected by passing through them. These include an L for an extra ball and dual rectangles to give you a second bat which moves around at random.

The game also comes with a full level editor, allowing you to design new levels and save them to tape or disk.</desc>

As you've captured the Rapier machine gun your enemy have been developing, there are plenty who can't bear to see the back of you unless it's bloodied and lifeless.

The game's 8 levels feature quite a variety of settings, vehicles and situations. You will have to evade fire from snipers based in windows, enemy jets, helicopters and well-trained marines, while riding tanks and speedboats as well as being on foot. The levels are set in locations such as the enemy camp, the jungle, a ruined city and the final flight back to your base.</desc>

The addition of ball physics, mulligans, changing the lie of the ball, real digitized environmental sounds, and the ability to view a replay (from multiple angles) helps to emphasize the realistic aspect.</desc>

		<desc>Young Simba just can't wait to be king. His father is the current King of the Savannah and the young prince is able to frolic the lands at will; jumping on and around other subjects of this animal kingdom. When Simba's father, King Mufasa, is killed and his evil brother Scar takes over the kingdom, Simba is banished from the lands of his birthright and has to grow up fast, honing his skills, for the day of his return.

The Lion King, based on the famous Disney movie, is a platform game where you control Simba - initially as a young cub, and later as an adult lion. The plot of the game follows the plot of the movie. Each of the levels represents a part of the movie. 

As young Simba, you can fight various beasts, such as lizards, by jumping on them. You can also roar to scare some creatures into submission, though every time you roar, you have to wait for your "roar meter" to charge. 

As an adult lion, you can still roar and jump, but now you fight enemies by slashing at them with your claws (if you're skillful enough, you can also grab them and toss them off the screen). 

The game features no in-game save function, and it needs to be replayed from the beginning every time.</desc>

Hipopo is supplied with magical water globes, which can be thrown at enemies to freeze them. Once frozen, the enemies can be kicked and destroyed completely. If idle for a few seconds, enemies will unfreeze themselves and continue their business. Every two levels is a boss that needs to be defeated in order to proceed to the next one.</desc>

When you load the game for the first time and personalise it with your name you'll see a house with several rooms like a kitchen, living room, bed room, etc. After some time of waiting a little person will appear and check out the house with all its rooms to see if he likes it. If he likes it, he will move in shortly and bring his dog along with him. That's where the real "game" starts and thats what it will be like every time you'll load the game from then. You see the house and the little person living in it, doing all kinds of stuff people do in their daily routine. He'll cook, eat, feed his dog, read newspapers, watch TV and from time to time he will write you a letter to let you know what he feels or what things he misses. To keep it more gamelike, you can "talk" to him in form of typing commands like "feed dog". You can also play cards with him and send him food or a present.
There is no aim in this game other than to interact with your LCP.</desc>

		<name>Livingstone 2</name>
		<desc>Livingstone II is an excellent sequel to Livingstone I Presume, Opera Soft's classic side-scrolling 2D platformer. Adventure game fans will be glad to know that Opera Soft drops the action focus of the first game this time around, and return to the action/adventure mix.

The plot is negligible, but it does pick up where the first game left off. You play Dr. David Livingstone, legendary adventurer who was found by journalist Stanley at the end of the first game. Your job is to get out of Africa jungles alive, but before that, you must discover ancient treasure hidden in the ruins. Similar to the first game, Livingstone II allows you to change weapons in your arsenal at any time. The trusty whip and pole, which is used to vault across chasms, are back and more useful than ever. In addition to weapon slots, you also have inventory slots to store and use non-weapon objects you come across. While much of the game still requires reflexes to succeed, there is a considerable number of adventure-style puzzles to solve. In addition to hostile animals, you must deal with traps and other obstacles.

I feel that Livingstone II is easier than the first game, perhaps because most danger comes in the form of traps, which you just need good timing to avoid, rather than angry creatures that you must dispose of to save yourself. As in the first game, the maps in Livingstone II are large and intricate, full of hidden surprises and shortcuts. Overall, Livingstone II is a fun action/adventure platformer that action fans will enjoy -- and adventure game fans may be interested in as well.</desc>

Hours of fun for you (and a camel-friend if you like) blowing away horde after horde of alien fiends in the comfort of your own personal environment!

This game is based on an old Williams arcade game by the same dude who wrote Defender. The game - Robotron - was a big hit in the early Eighties. Llamatron takes the Robotron idea and distorts it in a Yakly fashion, adding loads of new stuff and plenty of furry beasties in the Llamasoft style.

You play the part of a totally hard laser-spitting llama. Your mission is to collect all the tiny sheep, llamas, camels and goats you see on each wave.  Standing in your way are great herds of unintelligent but numerous Grunt enemies, plus a veritable menagerie of nasty creeps which fire at you, dodge your fire, emit fire hydrants, try to ram you, murder your llamas and shoot your bottom off with lasers. Kill them deadly.

Not everything can be killed, and some enemies take more than one shot to destroy. Your ultimate objective - destroy the Ozric Tentacle of level 99 and get to Herd Heaven on level 100.</desc>

The objective of the game is to travel between stations avoiding the enemy. Move forwards/backwards by moving stick right/left. Change tracks by moving stick forwards/backwards. Pressing fire releases smoke with which you can shoot down enemy planes.

Also en-route you will encounter mailbags which can be picked up for bonus points and water towers which if stopped at will replenish your water supply.

Each level is more difficult to complete than the previous one with number and type of enemy forces increasing. After completion of each level and calculation of mailbag and time bonuses there is a bonus level where you must shoot down planes to earn extra points.</desc>

All levels have to be solved within a time limit and a password is given once every five levels. In game one and three, all moves can be undone. In the first game, the player needs to recreate a stone combination shown in the lower part of the screen. To do so, he places a single stone on the playfield. However, each stone also has a value between one and four which needs to be matched. Every time a stone is placed besides another stone, the value of the stone already on the field rises by one. If the value was already four, it resets to one. In the second game, a pre-defined stone combination has to be erased. To do so, the player clicks on a stone which then disappears. But the stones around the clicked stone (left, right, above and below) also disappear. If there is no stone on a clicked place or a place around it, one is created. In the third game, the goal is the same as in game two. However, only two stones of the same value and colour can be taken from the playfield. The value of the stones around a taken stone rises by one.</desc>

		<desc>Sweet she is and sweets she wants. Young Lolly wakes up and has an incredibly appetite for candy. For chocolate, and for caramel and gingerbread, and for cookies and crisps and marshmallows and lemonade and bubblegum and jelly bears and ice and cream and sugar frosted chocolate bombs. All right, we’ve all had such moments. But Lolly is a doll. Animated by a stroke of lightning, she suddenly has life, a sweet tooth and a quest: Onward to the land where candy grows and the refrigerators never run out!

It’s a hostile world for small, innocent and rather hungry little dolls – that’s why you’ve got to help Lolly find her way through eight big levels in this jump’n’run game. After the escape from the toy factory, the way to the promised land leads through places like a ghost town, a snow world and even Lolly’s own cottony dreams. The way is far from safe: plenty of traps and monsters threaten a doll’s life, but good timing, athletic leaps and an ample supply of lollipops to fling at obtrusive enemies help mastering any challenge. In desperate situations, Lolly can take a snapshot with her pocket camera, which instantly destroys all opponents on the screen. Huge level bosses guard the exit of each world; defeating the mega-monsters requires specific tactics. 

Fortunately, there is support: chests contain key items (to unlock different parts of each level), power-ups and plenty of sweets, of course. On the downside, the boxes may also yield harmful objects that jumble up Lolly’s controls or even hurt her. Tender dolls of that model can sustain three hits before they break apart. There’s a time limit for each level, so sucking popsicles in a corner won’t do. You cannot save the game, but you get a personal passcode after each level.</desc>

		<name>Loom</name>
		<desc>Loom is an adventure game that sets itself apart from other titles in the genre through its unique gameplay system: the player character does not carry items around, but rather manipulates objects through the use of spells (called "drafts" in the game). The drafts themselves are woven by playing magical notes on a special instrument called "distaff". All the puzzles in the game are solved by learning and correctly applying these drafts.

Each draft is a sequence of four notes within one octave. The player learns new drafts by exploring the environment and interacting with it through a simple point-and-click interface. Once a draft has been learned, it may be applied in a different situation in order to solve a problem. Drafts range from simple general actions (such as opening) to more specific and complex commands, e.g. turning straw into gold. Drafts can also be "reversed", i.e. played backwards, in order to execute the opposite action (for example, closing something instead of opening). As the game progresses Bobbin learns to play higher notes on the distaff, allowing him to access more drafts.</desc>

		<name>Loopz</name>
		<desc>A puzzle game where the main goal is to make loops! Random pieces are presented over a board, including simple lines and corners as well as S bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. It is up to the player to link them up in a loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.

Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.

Three play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style. 

Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score. and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.

The third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.</desc>

		<name>Lords Of Chaos Expansion Kit One</name>
		<desc>Turn-based strategy game based on Julian Gollop's earlier games, Chaos and Laser Squad. The setting is pure fantasy Ã¢â‚¬â€ the Old World is wrecked by magical discharges, and the wizards who attempted to keep it balanced ultimately gave up, and used their skill to create a new world. These Lords of Chaos (up to four, played either by human or computer) may now battle for control of this world.

The idea of the game is to escape the level within a certain number of moves (preferably carrying lot of treasure and having killed the evil wizard Torquemada). Along the way you can use wizardry weapons and spells (there are 45 in total, created by combining ingredients) to conjure up mystical creatures like dragons and unicorns, but unfortunately so can Torquemada. Worlds include marshlands, castles and forests.</desc>

		<name>Lords of Doom</name>
		<desc>A potentially good horror RPG that unfortunately fumbled, Lords of Doom from Attic/StarByte looks, feels, and plays like a second-rate Ã¢â‚¬Å“BÃ¢â‚¬Â horror movie than Alfred Hitchcock classic. You control a party of four characters, two hapless citizens and two vampire hunters, who are the last human survivors in the town of Vertic that has been overrun by evil minions of the hordes of darkness. Your job, naturally, is to fight hideous monsters, find the lairs of four unholy lords, and vanquish them from the land.

Gameplay is standard first-person perspective, with party members displayed in four portraits at the bottom of the screen. In addition to health bar, each character has a food and thirst level bars which you must take care to fill by having the character eat or drink. This might add a fun touch of realism to the game, but unfortunately the extreme lack of food and water makes gameplay very frustrating. Worst yet, each character only has 6 inventory slots, so saving a ton of food for later consumption is out of the question.

The game does offer some find-key-to-unlock-door puzzles, but the endless hordes of monsters (most of which look the same) makes playing an exercise in frustration. Overall, Lords of Doom is a huge disappointment... a game that promises a lot but ends up being only a bland RPG. Only the most die-hard horror RPG fans might be interested in this one.</desc>

Play takes place on a gigantic scrolling map which tends to consist mostly of forests and mountain ranges, all of which are there to be explored. As time goes on the sun sets and the moon comes up - the land is even more dangerous at night. At night time make sure you sleep indoors. Don't just bed down on a makeshift camp because the chances are you'll never wake up - death comes easy to strangers in this mysterious world!</desc>

		<name>Lords of War</name>
		<desc>1990 saw the release of Lords of War on the Amiga systems, a Breakout clone game with interesting idea, created and distributed by Digital Concepts.

On every screen, there is a castle defended by a movable shield. The shield can be moved horizontally and vertically (always along the castle wall). The goal is to bring down the walls of one of the other castles within a given time limit. If no one does this in time, the game automatically switches to "fast speed" until the first slot is shattered.

The well animated graphic looks decent, changes from level to level and the scrolling is nice. The sound effects are according to the atmosphere, beautifully creepy - timely. You can not complain about the joystick control either. What else is there? Menu with numerous options (faster, slower, etc.), pause function, highscore list. The gameplay is not exactly the latest, but the original presentation and the built-in gags, The Lords of War lift something of the usual breakout monotony from. After all...</desc>

		<name>Lothar Matthaus Die Interaktive Fussballsimulation</name>
		<desc>Lothar MatthÃƒÂ¤us is a solid soccer simulation from Audiogenic, published by OCEAN. Despite bearing the name of one of Germany's best players, the game's scope is not as large as the likes of Champion Manager; instead, the game focuses on tactics and action-oriented gameplay where you can control each player directly. The game strikes a good balance between action and tactics, although neither element is as good as the best of each camp. Choose to lead your favorite club from five European countries (England, France, Italy, Spain, and Germany) in a friendly match, league, or cup play. Overall, Lothar MatthÃƒÂ¤us is a decent beer-and-pretzel soccer simulation/action game that doesn't take itself too seriously. Good as a quick fix, but lacking in long-term play value to warrant repeated play.</desc>

		<desc>The first in a series of 3 racing games endorsed by the legendary car company, which is now a part of Proton.

The game features a total of 32 fictitious racetracks from around the world, split into 3 difficulty levels. There are 19 computer opponents (15 on the 8-bit versions) and you have to finish in the top 10 (top 8 on the 8-bits) to progress. The higher you finish in one race, the lower down the grid you start for the next race. The opposition drivers have pun names based on the F1 drivers of the day - examples include Ricardo Pastry and Crashhard Banger.

You can choose between sound effects or one of a variety of music pieces. The game features a simultaneous 2-player mode, but the 1-player mode only uses half the screen, a simple animation filling the other half. In most races you will have to make a pitstop for fuel in order to reach the finish. The tracks include features such as oil slicks, roadworks, boulders and rivers - contact with these (or the other cars) will slow you, but there is no car damage model.</desc>

Not all of his experiments worked out the way they should and now he needs to shut down the power in five of his labs (the first four can be tackled in any order). This plays out as a standard platformer: Mariarti jumps over gaps between platforms and dodges enemies (he can take a few hits before dying) until he reaches the end of the level, i.e. the off switch. 

At the start of the game he only throw wrenches to defend himself, but during the game he finds coins scattered around the labs. Those can be used to buy more advanced weapons like a laser cannon. However, killed enemies respawn after a short time. To proceed he also needs to solve a few puzzles by collecting items and bringing them to the correct place. There are also a number of switch puzzles.</desc>

		<desc>This is a budget game and budget games have a preordained right to have an element of tackiness, right? Wrong. Since the dawn of time it seems that only one out of every fifteen new budget titles were good, and it looks like staying that way on the Amiga.

Set in Egypt you play the part of the cat goddess Mafdet who is trying to recover the Book of the Dead which has been stolen by the evil god Seth and unless it is recovered no Egyptian will be able to enter the afterlife.

Being a god Mafdet can transform into a cat as well as her normal human form. In cat mode Mafdet can run, jump and pick up objects - not too much use against the minions of Seth, but at least they don't notice you. As a woman you can swing a fairly brutal sword.

The general playing area is large, and I found myself noticing a new exit from the screens just as I thought I was stuck. Some exits are too low to allow the woman to pass through until you run into them with the cat. Other times a hole in the floor is the best way through.

The graphics are really large, though the animation and definition fail to make any lasting impact. As well as not being exactly too pretty to look at the main character is also impossible to control accurately. Mafdet is depressing to play, it's not that cheap and it most definitely isn't cheerful.</desc>

You fly through a set of tunnels presented in a mixture of vectors and solid 3D, with arrows guiding you as to which way to go. The ship's damage is split into ten areas, and the auto-repair feature can be set to prioritise these. Energy resources are limited, and must be allocated across different areas of the ship.

Accurate steering and shooting are not enough Ã¢â‚¬â€œ puzzles protect the route, and these will take some pondering. You are armed with multiple weapons (types of lasers, mines, a rear-gunning-droid and various guiding missiles), each of which has its own use. You also have an on-board map and radar, as well as a turbo facility.</desc>

		<name>Magic Johnson's Basketball</name>
		<desc>Magic Johnson's Basketball is a decent arcade-style basketball game starring LA Lakers' superstar Magic Johnson, one of the most famous players of all time. It is a direct translation of the popular coin-op arcade game called Magic Johnson's Fastbreak Basketball. Like the arcade original, the game is easy enough for beginners to learn, and challenging enough for experts. You can play against the computer or another human opponent in a hot-seat mode.

As an arcade-oriented game, Magic Johnson's Basketball is pretty good. You can shoot 3-pointers, perform slam dunks, and of course Magic Johnson's famous fast break with a slam dunk finish. The game includes a good training sequence, demo mode, and smooth animation.

When compared with other basketball games made during the same period, Magic Johnson's Basketball falls flat with many limitations. You can only play a single game, unlike the entire season that Ed Ringler's Omni-Play Basketball (also a Magic Johnson-promoted game) simulates. And the on-court action is far from the fun of EA's 1988 classic One on One: Jordan vs. Bird. Without the competition, Magic Johnson's Basketball would have been considered a great game. But basketball fans simply have many better choices to choose from than this game.</desc>

		<name>Magicland Dizzy</name>
		<desc>Magicland Dizzy is a platform adventure game published in Europe in 1990 by Codemasters for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amiga platforms.   It is the sixth game in the Dizzy series, and the fourth adventure-based Dizzy title. The story, set in a fantasy world called Magicland, follows on from the events of Fantasy World Dizzy, the previous adventure title. In Magicland Dizzy the player controls Dizzy, an egg-shaped character, who is trying to save six of his friends who have been placed under spells by the Evil Wizard Zaks.

In Magicland Dizzy the player guides Dizzy, an egg-shaped character, through a large maze in an attempt to rescue his six friends who are held captive under the influence of various magic spells. The locations are all located in the titular "Magicland" and are fantastical in nature, many inspired by fairy tales. They include a field of standing stones called Weirdhenge, a witch's island and Prince Charming's castle. Movement from one screen to the next is enabled through flip-screen such that when Dizzy touches the outer edge of one screen he is transported to the next. The individual screens consist of platforms and ladders with Dizzy able to both walk and jump to navigate the maze and its obstacles. Dizzy can collect up to three items at once which are then used at specific locations to solve puzzles and advance through the game. At the start of the game the player has three lives and a health bar which can be replenished by finding and collecting diamonds scattered throughout the maze.</desc>

But unfortunately the only way to get one is to travel through ten dangerous levels in the forbidden lands of Wrabis. In principle the player just needs to guide the marble from left and right, but of course there are various obstacles to make life harder. For starters, the way mostly consists only of a tight gangway of tiles with endless space around it. Also there are switch puzzles to solve and tiles with different properties to consider, e.g. disappearing ones, ramps or ice tiles which are obviously problematic for a rolling protagonist.

On the way there are dollar symbols to collect which can be reinvested in shops (which can be reached by rolling over the associated tile). Here the player can purchase helpful extras like extra time to expand the time limit, a level skip or legs. Sometimes extras can also collected directly on the way without the need to spend money.</desc>

You are in control of a car, driving up a vertically scrolling road with occasional forks in it, making the game similar to Spy Hunter. The car is mounted with guns, and so are many enemy cars, but cars can be rammed off the road as well as shot. Watch out for other enemy vehicles such as helicopters though; be sure to avoid their bullets. You can drive into the back of open lorries to gain upgraded weapons. Weapons are activated via keyboard presses, which makes the game more difficult than it would otherwise be. Sound and music sampled from suitably action-packed films aims to add to the atmosphere.</desc>

		<desc>First in Krisalis' trio of soccer games based on the exploits of Manchester United, Manchester United Europe is a fun action soccer game that lets you lead this popular club in major European tournaments, including the European Cup, European Cup Winners Cup, UEFA Cup, European Super Cup, and even the World Club Championship -- a more obscure tournament held each year in Japan.

Amiga game features excellent graphics and 4-player action via 4-player joystick adapter. You can, for example, easily execute one-touch football and aftertouch tricks. In contrast with most other soccer games of the era, you have full control over your goalie's actions. Coaching options, while much more limited than specialized soccer sims, are adequate: you can do substitutions, see players get yellow and red cards from the referee, and watch action replays. There's little difference between "full simulation" and "arcade" mode since the effects of your coaching strategies aren't too obvious in the game. Still, Manchester United Europe paves the way to more full-fledged soccer games from Krisalis, and is great fun for casual soccer fans who are confident in their joystick skills. It's not Sensible Soccer, but it has its own personality and style that deserve a closer look.</desc>

		<name>Manchester United - The Double</name>
		<desc>This game is based on the wonderful '93-94 season of the English Premier League Championship. Which is, of course, the year when Manchester United won both the English league and FA cup in the same season. Hence Ã¢â‚¬Å“The DoubleÃ¢â‚¬Â in the name of the game. But don't let this fool you, you can choose to play any team from the top 5 leagues of the English game. Also you can customize any team or player in the league to fit your liking. Not that it gets any better than Keane, Giggs and Cantona though...

The statistical side if the game is impressive, as is the tactical. Both are quite simple and straight-forward, but still lets an advanced manager fiddle around a lot. You choose formation, players, arrange transfers and of course play games.

The matches are similar to what it looks and feels like in Kick Off 3 or even Sensible soccer. Graphics are OK but not more, the sound actually has some crowd noises and chants. If you listen closely you'll hear: Ã¢â‚¬Å“United, UnitedÃ¢â‚¬Â. Not surprising perhaps but it does make the matches more lively.

Controls during the games are good, but it's quite hard to score in your first games. Keep going though and you'll find that it can be done, but you'll hardly get many Ã¢â‚¬Å“crazyÃ¢â‚¬Â results against top-level opposition. The heading of the ball is a bit strange as the players look to jump about 5 meters up in the air, and have a hang-time that would make Michael Jordan jealous.

This was the third in Krisalis series of United games, it's also the best in my opinion. Not a true classic but you can challenge a friend or have some tough games anyway. Fighting your way through the friendlies, cups and leagues with your favourite team is really fun. A recommended download for anyone that enjoys football games.</desc>

		<desc>'The most famous club in the world' has had its problems in the League recently, but maybe you think you could do a better job, so here's your chance. As well as making managerial decisions you can even play for the entire team!

But before you get your boots on, there's a bit of managing to do via the icon-driven menu system. Of course, no amount of training will be enough for some old snoggers so they can be sold and new players bought via the transfer system.

Matches are viewed from side-on view. Both United and the opposition can be player or computer-controlled. Players dribble automatically and shoot when the fire button is released - the strength of kick determined by the time fire was held down. In addition you can chip the ball by pressing fire again quickly afterwards. Tackling is achieved either by running into the ball or by doing a sliding tackle. If mistimed the latter can lead to a free kick.

In terms of presentation you have easy-to-use menus with a fair amount of disk accessing. Graphics are okay apart from pastel colour scheme and 'skating' players. Sound represents appallingly annoying tune with a reasonable match FX. Gameplay is not that great since it is frustratingly difficult to score goals. Man Utd fans will enjoy the almost forgotten experience of winning the league. Like the team, strictly second division.</desc>

The Manhunters are human employees of the Orbs who have the job of tracking down, capturing and handing over people conducting anti-Orb activities.

The game action is broken up in four ways. First, there are close up views of your immediate area which allow you to interact with the objects and characters around you. Next is the transport screen, which is basically a map of 'Cisco showing all the locations you can visit. Third are the arcade sequences which include shoot 'em ups, and a maze-like game similar to that found in the hospital section of It Came From The Desert. Finally there are animated sequences which help break up the action and add to the atmosphere of the game.

There are no text commands; everything is entered via the mouse and the return key, so you don't have to worry about ambiguous transatlantic gibberish.

The graphics are technically poor and clumsy, but some of the animated sequences are superb. The accompanying soundtrack, however, is totally inadequate and spoils the effect. Overall, Manhunter: San Francisco is an exciting sequel. Don't expect a Leisure Suit Larry clone, it's nothing like it, rather Manhunter has a style all its own.</desc>

		<desc>Manhunter: New York is a point and click adventure game. Well, maybe not so much click. The game doesn't have outstanding graphics, even for that period. It doesn't have a richly developed storyline, either. What it does have is just enough plot and just enough mystery and adventure to keep most people interested.

Manhunter is puzzle driven with some arcade style action sequences thrown in. While the NPC character development is very weak, it is your detective skills in tracking the non-playing characters and determining their motives that makes the game interesting.

The game begins in the future. The year 2002 to be exact (ahem). Aliens have invaded New York and taken over the city. Being that the aliens have no arms and legs they must recruit humans to do the work of policing the population and eliminating any threats to the alien rule. Your part in the game begins two years after the invasion. You are one of the privileged manhunters and are rousted form your slumber by one of the aliens who is directing you to investigate a case involving an explosion and murder at Bellevue Hospital. Your adventure will take place over the course of four days. 

Bottom line. Even though Manhunter: New York is not strong on either the plot or graphics fronts it is, nonetheless, fun to play. The game will certainly test your puzzle solving and detective skills. Long live the resistance.</desc>

The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, which makes it harder to stay focused on the direction the ball is to follow. There are tight corridors to follow and enemies to avoid. There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you're racing against the clock.</desc>

The gameplay is very similar to Ancos older game Strip Poker II+. In the game itself you can raise bets and can trade each cloth part for 100 credits if you are running out of cash and your hand is too good to not raise. There are two different difficulty levels, "Easy" and "Hard". The AI does sometimes bluffing with aggressive bets.</desc>

There are stars to collect, extra lives on offer, slides, tubes, ladders, caterpillars to move across, and bonus fruit to collect. The levels are inhabited by typical enemies, some of which are killed by jumping on their heads, while others must be kicked or shot (once you collect a weapon). Many of the annoyances which plague platform games, such as blind jumps and spikes appearing at random, are deliberately absent from this. The graphics are intentionally cute, using the AGA chip-set for 256 colours.</desc>

This game is based on the idea of Bomberman. You can play with up to 5 enemies at the same time. The main goal is to survive and kill all the other enemies. You can do this by placing bombs on the ground. They will destroy the brick walls around you and may even release some extras to collect.

Very good Bomberman/DynaBlaster clone that only focus is on the VS Battle aspect of the game. It remains one of the best multiplayer PD games ever!</desc>

The object of the game is to get a ball called "Plasmorb" into the goal, which moves along the edge of the play field. Otherwise, the rules are simple : "Three minutes, two players, one victor!"

The game is played in first-person on a split screen and can be played by either one or two players.

In addition to the original Ballblazer game, Masterblazer offers two new playing options: a Tournament Mode and a Rotofoil Race.</desc>

It was licensed around the BBC's football highlights programme famed for its classic theme music. The standard options exist (such as training, transfers and tactics) but the control system is unique. A diary is presented on the table, and you have to drag the icons for the activities you want to focus that amount of time on. This not only makes the presentation and style unusual, but also accurately represents the limited amount of time a real manager has.</desc>

		<desc>Car racing games have always been a favourite on the Amiga, especially top-down racers where you can take on your mates. MAX Rally hopes to build on the playability and graphic appeal of previous classics such as Skidmarks and Micro Machines and bring the whole genre up to date.

As well as being able to play against up to four human players, various other racing modes are available, including racing against computer cars, racing against the clock or participating in a Championship or Max Challenge. There are twenty different tracks and four different types of terrain (Woodland, Cosmic, Alpine and Dunes) to be negotiated.

Link up games are also possible, so you can play two player split-screen, two player link up or four player split-screen link up. If you don't have two Amigas to stick together you can play in a battle mode where the slowest cars are eliminated as they fall off the screen.

MAX Rally fails to inspire. It's fun for a little while, in a sub-Skidmarks sort of way, but the computer opponents are too easy and the multiplayer mode isn't imaginative enough to retain interest for long. It's like the original Micro Machines, only half a decade late. Five years ago, maybe.</desc>

		<desc>In Mayday Squad, the Lutonian Embassy has been taken over by the Red Legion terror organisation and the ambassador's daughter has been kidnapped. The player takes the role of a group of three special agents which have to save her within a time limit. The player has to choose between nine soldiers which are divided into three categories: leader (shooting), demolition (grenades) and communication (opening locks and picking up items). The soldiers within the same category also have different advantages and weaknesses. Also chosen before starting the mission is the difficulty level and hit points of the team members. During the game itself, one member is controlled by the player and the others by the AI. However, to perform special actions it is possible to instantly switch between them. This is needed because there are a lot of options how to proceed in the maze-like embassy, e.g. players may choose to open a lock or shoot it open. While a large portion of the game is dedicated to finding the way and searching for clues which hint to the daughter's location, there are also strong action elements: When meeting enemies and controlling the leader, the cursor has to be quickly moved over the opponents to shoot them before they can damage the team. Resources like ammo are limited.</desc>

Besides the gold coins, each arena is filled with monsters, hazards, and weapons which you must look out for. Use the map to help you locate these.

As you progress through the arenas, there are new challenges which you must face such as multi-level arenas, locked doors and passages, slippery surfaces, and much more. Also scattered throughout the arenas is the letter "B", which when collected will award you a letter that make up the word CREDIT. When you have formed the word, you will be awarded an extra credit. Besides the standard arenas, there are also speed arenas, which are more difficult than the others. The object of these arenas is to get past more obstacles and gather as many coins as you can before the time expires.

In each arena, you will receive messages from time to time, as well as a password, which you can enter to resume that game from that arena.</desc>

It turns out that he was one of eight scientists involved in Project Overlord, a mission to remotely control people. Tex soon learns of the deaths of other related figures. Suspects may include the British intelligence head, a surveillance company owner, and the professor's daughter.

Tex's first adventure takes the player through the seedy West Coast world of 2033, a setting that combines futuristic elements with film noir and "hardboiled" detective fiction styles. The game's main adventure portions are icon-driven, with object puzzles less significant than detective deduction and character interaction. Characters are represented by digitized photos.

Mean Streets features dozens of characters to interact with by asking questions or offering bribes. Fights often arise, but a diplomatic approach is more successful with characters whose guilt is unproven. Although it is largely an adventure game, travel between cities involves piloting Tex's Lotus Speeder in a flight simulation section. The game also contains side-scrolling action sequences where Tex has to eliminate a number of enemies before being able to proceed to the destination.</desc>

You all know how to play an Arkanoid clone, right?  I don't have to explain that you have a paddle and a ball and you must bounce the ball into some blocks to score points, right?  And I certainly don't need to mention that if you let the ball miss the paddle and drop off the screen you will die, right?  And I also don't need to explain about how little bonuses can drift down from the blocks and if they touch your paddle they can do anything from giving you free lives to blowing you up, depending on the little pictures on the bonuses as they are drifting down, right?
Good. I was afraid I'd have to put a lengthy explanation here!

The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which can be completed in any order, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its own surprises. 

Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles. Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.</desc>

		<name>Mega Motion</name>
		<desc>Mega Motion is a puzzle game where the player has to move a number of balls across the screen towards an exit. The balls are linked together with one acting as an anchor the others are constantly rotating around. The game is played with the mouse. By clicking on one of the balls it becomes the anchor that the others rotate around. Clicking with the right mouse button changes the direction of the rotation.

Each level has obstacles that block the balls' path and objects that can be collected. Most common are blocks that are destroyed after being hit by a ball a couple of times but there are also those obstacles that destroy the ball that hits them. There are also bombs, which set off chain reactions when hit, and switcher blocks that reveal hidden doors or open up new passages. When all balls but one have been destroyed a life is lost and the level has to be restarted. Each level also has a time limit. Overstepping it is allowed but the player will then get a lower score. 

The game has a total of 100 levels that are divided into four categories: easy, average, difficult and very difficult. For every level completed the player is given a password.</desc>

		<name>Mega Phoenix</name>
		<desc>Mega Phoenix brings the concept of the earlier arcade game Phoenix into the 90s, to the extent that a coin-op version was later made by Gaelco. The game is a single-screen shoot ‘em up in which the player moves left to right while shooting several waves. There is a shield function available, which lasts for a short period of time (after which it must recharge to be used again) and it paralyses the craft while active.

The first waves consist of several small alien beings in a set pattern, which move down from the fleet towards the player at random intervals- contacts with these kills the player. Deadly phoenixes firing at you come next, followed by the Mega Phoenix itself and then a final boss, before it all repeats with higher difficulty.</desc>

		<name>MegaTraveller 1 - The Zhodani Conspiracy</name>
		<desc>Life in the 51st century it rougher than ever. Mankind, now under the rule of the Third Imperium, has realised his dream to reach into the stars, and has made contact with all manner of weird and wonderful alien life-forms for his trouble.
The most alarming of these extra-terrestrial contacts, made in 5018, was with a virtually identical race known as the Zhodani. The contact was not a pleasant one, however, and the first of four Frontier Wars soon broke out between the two races.
You'd think that after four bouts of inter-stellar genocide the two sides would have had enough, but, for reasons best known to themselves, a group of corrupt officials within the Imperium is preparing to start a fifth Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and, as always, there's only one person that can stop them.

Well five people actually. Barely 10 minutes ago, your merry band of travellers was having a quiet drink when a frantic young lady pushed a holographic disk into your hands, burbled something about a traitor and was attacked by a group of thugs. You made your excuses and left... quickly. Now it seems there's a price on your head and every bounty hunter in the galaxy is on your tail.
So, to take stock of your situation: you hold the only evidence which can expose the traitors and have to deliver it to the officials on some faraway planet - all of this under the less-than-friendly scrutiny of the meanest villains in the cosmos, never rains but it pours.</desc>

		<name>Mega Typhoon</name>
		<desc>You start your mission with a lone starfighter with some very puny lasers. At this stage it's still got a very handy set of lasers with which you can take out just about anything moving, but you'll have to set your joystick to auto-fire. While Mega Typhoon is a typical vertical shoot-em-up, you can move a little to the left and right while picking up some useful extra laser power ups, missiles, homing missiles, side-shots and extra lives.

You can also press the space bar which activates a smart bomb weapon that effectively wipes out any opposing enemy ships in the vicinity. Once you've got to grips with what's going on, it's on to the next world.

The game is fast, and the action is as frenetic as anything you've seen on the Amiga in a long while... but the in-game graphics are pretty basic and colourless. The sound is sadly lacking with only a few effects for explosions and lasers and a racey-but-unobtrusive soundtrack at the beginning.

Mega Typhoon is a playable game, it's just that I've seen the Amiga do better with Hybris, Battle Squadron, Swiv or Xenon 2. It is an average game that hasn't really much to offer the already saturated shoot-em-up genre. Which is a shame because we all know that the Amiga can do so much better than this.</desc>

		<name>Mercenary III - The Dion Crisis</name>
		<desc>In this third part of the Mercenary series you have to enlarge your previous success by getting as much money as you can within 24 hours. To do this you visit the locations of that solar system with either some public transport, or you also can find your old star glider. There is also a teleportation system, which speeds things up. Initially you are struck by the size of the accessible area, but eventually you explore the area and you find single tasks, the completion of which
brings you money.

The buildings are nicely constructed, although a bit distant from each other, so there are large areas of nothing, but on the other hand you don't need to walk between them. Unlike in other adventures there's not only one way to complete the game, so your chances of solving it is increased significantly. The graphics are reasonably fast on a powerful Amiga, so it's really fun to play it if you get into it. The position of your game can be saved every time on one of the 10 slots.

As far as gameplay goes though, it's a winner. Perhaps a bit too slow moving for hard-bitten arcade fans, but for those who like to ponder over problems rather than leaping in feet first all guns blazing, it's the closest you're going to get to virtual reality on your Amiga. And it's a damn sight more interesting as well. A large, bulging sack of gorgeousness.</desc>

You're a mercenary, and it just so happens that the two races on the planet are at war. So why not use that to your advantage and do some favors for each race... against cash?

Finding strategic placings is important, especially as you can't shoot while on water. Most of the time you are on foot, but at times you can hijack vehicles of shot foes. There are improved weapons, smart bombs and energy recharges to collect. Each of the 8 levels ends with a large vehicle requiring multiple shots to destroy.</desc>

Each level is not side-scrolling fluidly, but is divided into separate screens; upon getting to the edge of one screen you move to the next one. 

The Metal Mutant has the ability to transform into 3 different forms: humanoid, dinosaur and tank. Each form has different capabilities. For instance, the humanoid form can jump and the tank can shoot missiles. You'll need to change form often depending on the situation, as most obstacles and enemies can be only beaten by a specific form. 

Throughout the game, apart from fighting enemies (and bosses), jumping, climbing and so on, you will find additional upgrades which will give you more abilities. You'll also encounter recharge station where you can regain health.</desc>

		<name>Metal Warrior</name>
		<desc>Released over a decade after being written in 1993, the Amiga Metal Warrior game is different from its C64 namesake, although they share a theme. Set in a dystopian 2010 - where mindless pop entertainment reigns, and free-thinking art is considered an act of rebellion - this action/adventure platformer puts you in the role of a heavy metal vocalist, who has just survived the suspicious crash of his band's tour bus. Metal band members are increasingly being attacked and victimized, and it's up to the player to survive the violence in the streets, investigate matters and uncover the truth about what's going on.

The inventory system provides room for weapons (to be used during the action sequences), and other items that aid you in your quest. It is possible to talk to non-hostile characters, get helpful hints, and/or trade items; certain items can also be bought and sold in various locations, using your score as money. You will also need to learn to play guitar - being a vocalist, you will need to start from the beginning: learn techniques by practicing, then use combinations of techniques to master complete songs. This will prove an essential skill for your success.</desc>

Your objective is to drive around Miami, looking for red cars and shooting them away, within a time limit for each level. Avoid hitting buildings or other cars, and don't shoot too many civilian cars or you are history. If you drive erratically in the vicinity of other cop cars they will stop you, costing valuable time.

		<desc>You know that castle thingy that you see on the titles of The Wonderful World of Disney, the one that looks all peaceful an' everythin'? Well, all is not as it seems. Inside the tower Mickey is fighting for peace, justice and the American way.

Merlin the magician has had his magic wand stolen by the evil Ogre King. The wand has been split into four pieces and given to witches at the top of the towers in the castle. The ogre has put ghosties and ghoulies and things in the towers to try and stop you from getting the wand back together, but you are armed with a squirt gun and a hammer to deal with them. Eventually you just seal up the doors and stop them from emerging. This is done by entering a series of sub-games: The Puddle Maze, The bubble Machine, The Pump Room and The Dripping Taps. At the top of each tower is a guardian thingie that must be shot in the head to retrieve a piece of the wand.

In my experience, cartoon character licences very rarely make good computer games, but I'm glad to say that the most famous of them all has managed to keep his reputation by spawning a cracker of a game. The graphics are nicely detailed and coloured, the ghostly music is more funny than spooky, creating exactly the right atmosphere to suit the already amusing gameplay - smacking teddy bears over the head is great fun.</desc>

I was fairly looking forward to what sounded like a lively and zap-crazed Tempest derivative. But yet again, in what's becoming a horribly familiar scenario, shattered dreams were the order of the day. It all starts promisingly, and for the first few minutes you think 'Yeah, corking stuff!' as you whizz around the rim of a circle blazing away heroically at the pulsating horde of tiny amoeba-like baddies throbbing their way out at you.

Sadly, an hour and a half later when you're on level 53 with all your lives still intact and the difficulty level not significantly higher than it was at the start you begin to have doubts. I ended up playing this one-handed while conducting a telephone conversation and not even watching the screen, and I still couldn't get killed. It's all lushly presented and professionally done, but this is strictly for those of you who find Fun School 4 too taxing.

Very nicely done, but an unutterably dull game beneath the attractive facade. For the terminally untalented only.</desc>

A handicap system is included to allow novices and experts to play together. In one player mode the 'ranking list' allows players to play head-to-head against computer opponents of varying skill and rise in the ranks.

Hitting the ball is done using same control system pioneered in Leaderboard and used in most golf games. First click on the mouse button starts the back swing, second sets the force and final click sets the snap.

Greens: The Ultimate 3-D Golf Simulation is a great golf simulation for the Amiga. Its system requirements are modest meaning even A500 owners will be able to play it properly. Like other golf sims it's appeal is limited to fans of this genre, but for those looking for a good, challenging sports simulation, they could do much worse than selecting this golf game from the flight simulation experts.</desc>

		<desc>Arcade-style soccer game. It has two different parts: Indoor and Outdoor. The Outdoor game is the normal European soccer. You may play single matches, league or tournament (world championships). Optional features are: weather effects, replays, customizable game length. Some quite funny movements and shots are available (e.g. banana flanks). The Indoor game has US soccer teams and plays on a much smaller field. It has different rules compared to outdoor soccer. You can play single matches, league and All Star tournament. The same movements and shots can be made, sometimes with even funnier effects (e.g. banana shot bouncing of the wall and into goal).</desc>

Take control of a Resistance fighter in this scrolling shoot 'em up consisting of nine platform-based levels, each ending with a Boss to defeat. Your enemies appear on foot and in vehicles, and Crimson has also planted machine gun bays en route. 

Dead enemies release keys, which can be traded in at shop points for weapons. These weapons include machine guns and flamethrowers, for which ammunition must be bought - weapons are discarded when you have no suitable ammo. The control system is unusual - you can shoot in different directions and crawl along low ledges.</desc>

As a special agent of the federation you must complete top secret missions designed to initiate rebellion among the Saharan people. I am glad to say that this game is much better than the excellent original. The game boasts a staggering 1,000,000 square miles of terrain for you to explore, utilising 22 different modes of transportation with which to get around. This game has such depth that you will be lost in it for hours, if not days once you get involved.</desc>

		<name>MiG-29 Fulcrum</name>
		<desc>One of the most powerful Soviet fighters, the Fulcrum has gone from Russian threat to star performer at Farnborough to Iraqi menace. Domark's sim puts you in the cockpit of a MiG in Soviet service, from pilot's school to combat. Sadly there's no sim to pit the MiG against the USAF or RAF, but five combat missions take in photo-reconnaissance in the Arctic, air-to-air combat over China, strafing terrorist trucks, a bombing raid against oil installations and destroying a nuclear reactor. The latter is the final mission (requiring 500 points to enter) which involves taking out air defences and landing on a runway to rearm.

As you'd expect there's a savable pilot's service record but sadly no weapons selection Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you always fly with the same mix of cannon, unguided rockets plus air-to-ground and air-to-air missiles.</desc>

		<desc>A great update of Simis/Domark's underrated flight sim MiG-29 Fulcrum. While essentially the same game (with the same campaigns and planes), Super Fulcrum improves on the outstanding predecessor in every respect, the most significant being graphics upgrade and more varied terrain, instead of the mostly flat ground in MiG-29 Fulcrum, Super Fulcrum sports entire mountain ranges and more ground features. In contrast to only one loadout in the previous game, Super Fulcrum offers three: air to ground, air to air, and a mix of both.

The great flight dynamics that Simis is famous for is intact, with even more tweaks to the engine to make the game more realistic. In short, if you like MiG-29 Fulcrum, you'll love Super Fulcrum.</desc>

A balanced party is a necessity in this game. There are several locations and items that are restricted to certain genders, alignments, or races. A party made up of Good Human Males won't get you very far. Time plays a large role in this game. Time travel is a part of it, but on a more basic level, you will find that characters age as the game goes on. If you wait too long, your characters' statistics will change to reflect their aging.

Although M&amp;M II is polished to fairly high sheen and is interesting to delve in to it's not a thinking player's game, but if you like a lot of mapping interspersed with the odd hack' n 'slay bout then you Might think this RPG Magic.</desc>

		<desc>A party of brave heroes managed to defeat the corrupted guardian Sheltem as he attempted to destroy the world of CRON. However, the great battle between the guardians Corak and Sheltem continued in another place - the world of Terra, where Sheltem was originally appointed as a guardian. Revolting against the powerful race of the Ancients, Sheltem takes possession of their space-traveling nacelles, hurling them at the suns of other planets. It is now up to a group of local adventurers to help Corak and vanquish Sheltem once and for all.

Isles of Terra is the third installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to Gates to Another World. Like its predecessors, it is a role-playing game focusing on first-person exploration of vast pseudo-3D environments, character building, and turn-based combat. The five selectable races remain the same as in the previous games, as well as the eight character classes with the addition of two new ones: Druid and Ranger. Like in the second game, characters may learn unique skills such as thievery, swimming, merchant, and others.

This installment does away with random or pre-set enemy encounters, featuring instead enemies dynamically roaming the game world, allowing to initiate combat from a distance (for example with ranged attacks or spells). There is no option to bribe or surrender to enemies, and escaping combat can be accomplished simply by moving away, unless the enemies have already locked on the party. An automap feature is available at all times, and the player is also allowed to save the game at any time.</desc>

Each level is split into two parts; an action zone and a Royal Palace room. The mechanics and level designs of the Royal Palace rooms are directly lifted from Bomb Jack. Action zones can be split up into several portions, and contain power-ups usually hidden in treasure chests such as money bags, Mighty Coins and Mighty Drinks. Mighty Coins allow Jack to change colors; blue allows Jack to open orange treasure chests, orange allows him to open any treasure chest by simply touching it from the side, and green transforms all enemies on the screen into coins for 5 seconds. Mighty Drinks add 10 seconds to the game's timer. Secret passages can also be found in the action zones, activated by finding a Sphinx in a visible or hidden treasure chest.</desc>

		<desc>As you can guess from the title, Mikro Mortal Tennis is basically founded on tennis game, but its goal is to eliminate your opponents, not simply to defeat them! To this purpose, players might make use of loads of Mortal-Kombat and Street-Fighter-like special moves, in addition to many others, directly taken from lots of famous videogames or films. Besides, there are bombs, Fire'n'forget rockets, heat-seeking missiles at their complete disposal... The game boasts an amusing animated intro which will explain the reason of such a strange tournament - by the way, your order is to climb a high mountain, just like the second episode of the Mortal Kombat saga; moreover, it features several victory and defeat pictures and an even more crazy final sequence than the intro!

Players can choose their characters from a range of twelve different guys, each distinguished with typical characteristics, which can be edited in the proper menu. Beyond every human conceiving, the game is spangled with lots of mad things, like referee-slaughtering, animals which will appear in the field, VIPs which will perform during the match, and a mysterious tapir named Fart (main character of the game, as you can be able to guess from the introduction) which will perform in a number of funny anims. At the beginning of the match the players will enter the field and choose the field in which play with an incredible money trowing!

Of course, the sporting side of the game is not to be underestimated. You'll always have to win your match! From this point of view, the game is classically structured: pitch type, number of sets to win, type of game (single, double or training), as well as the type of tournament to join; you'll be able to select, in addition to the above-mentioned MK-style tournament, an UNFRIENDLY tournament in which up to eight human players are allowed to take part, or a full season, where player will have to win as much as possible to travel all over the world, and in order to buy weapons and points which will help him in his short career. It's possible to save and subsequently restore your season from disc as well as every change made in the players editing menu, where you're able to change the name, the characteristics and the shirt colour of all the characters... Well, that's all, there's nothing left but wishing you to enjoy Mikro Mortal Tennis! Mikro Mortal Tennis supports all Amiga models with at least 1 Meg of Ram.</desc>

		<desc>Mindbender uses similar gameplay principles to Deflektor, which means that you have indirect control over a beam of light. On each of the 50 levels you must guide it from a starting point to an ending point, taking out all the enemies along the way. Rotating each of the many mirrors on the level to send the beam onto the points the enemies hover over does this – reaching many of them will involve several attempts at finding the right combination of angles. Rotating barriers, light bulb switches and locked sections must all be taken into account, but there are also magic balloons later on. All this must be done within a time limit, and directing the beam back into itself causes overloads and must be avoided, Tron-style.</desc>

		<path>./Mindfighter_v1.0.lha</path>
		<name>Mindfighter</name>
		<desc>Mindfighter is one of the best post-apocalyptic adventures ever made, although sadly not many people played it when the game was released in 1988.

The game is based on the prophecies of 16th century French prophet Nostradamus, who predicted that the third world war would erupt in late 20th century, beginning somewhere in the Middle East. You play four people with para-psychological powers living in Southampton, who are trying to help Robin, your 11-year-old boy friend whose mind is trapped in a nightmarish future. Robin's immense para-psychological powers allow you to control other people's minds, as well as metamorphose into various animals. Curious to find the results of an upcoming exam, Robin projected his mind forward in time - only to discover himself in a post-holocaust Southampton where famine, radioactive fallout, and rabble is everywhere, and people are enslaved by an evil order called the System. While Robin's physical body lies inert in 20th century, you must help him fight the System and eventually prevent the war itself from happening.

The game's hallmark is the excellent, extremely atmospheric writing that evokes the true horrors of nuclear holocaust. Puzzles are mostly logical and believable. As well as more typical adventure problems, Mindfighter challenges you to survive the real-life problems that you would face when trying to survive as an outcast in this fascist state.

Overall, Mindfighter is a thoroughly entertaining, serious, and thought-provoking game, which draws you into the brutal reality of the future. Although the game sounds a bit dogmatic at times, it is never really overbearing, and the intriguing plot and well-written characters will keep you interested for hours on end. Highly recommended.</desc>

The aim of the first level was to connect a path from a certain location to a specific crystal in the brain by using the correct avatars with the correct landscape type, all the while defending against hostile enemies (that decreased in frequency as the player approached the destination). In the second level, the player had to guide the avatar around a maze full of pulsing neurons to locate a pyramidal Ã¢â‚¬Å“shard of sanityÃ¢â‚¬Â using audio cues. Touching a neuron while it pulsed meant instant death, so good timing was required to collect the pyramid and return to the neuron-surrounded exit. The last stage required the player to complete a Rorschach-inspired colour-cycling puzzle in order to replace the shard. The levels looped several times before the restoration of the physicistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sanity.</desc>

The hit is performed with the left mouse button and the strength depends on how long it is hold.

It is bright, it is colourful and it is easy to play. All you have got to do is manipulate the oncoming coloured blocks into matching groups of four or more. Each time you do this you send a fish symbol or little grey blocks down on your opponent's side mucking up their arrangements so they have got to get rid of them.

As well as grouping your blocks together you have got a variety of weapons at your disposal. There are three offensive weapons and three defensive ones. A red bar at the bottom increases as you progress through the game and so does your weapon status.

That gripe aside, control is easy enough, press down on the joystick to speed up the blocks, up to select weapons and left and right to move the blocks around. Likewise on the keyboard use left and cursor keys to move either way, right Amiga and right Alt to rotate the blocks.

Minskies is totally addictive and great fun to play. The in-game tune and the little shouts of "here we go" and "you're in trouble now" add to the overall enjoyment. The only problem I have with it was that, at times, there did not seem to be much difference between easy, medium and hard mode.</desc>

		<name>Missiles Over Xerion</name>
		<desc>The crisis begun in the year 2110. An alien biological weapon, named Ã¢â‚¬Å¾ArmageddonÃ¢â‚¬Å“ by the priests, wiped out all but 2000 humans, farmers and prisoners hiding in Xerion, the golden city of the planet... Luckily that city also has an experimental plasma cannon, as an alien invasion is expected.

Missiles over Xerion is a Missile Command variation, in which the player has to defend the naming town. Released later in the Amigas lifetime, many options and convenience features, like an built-in trainer menu, are added to the aged original game, but without basically changing the gameplay itself.

You can equip Xerion, the town to defend, as far as you have earned the money for it. You can buy weapons, like nuclear or heavy metal missiles, different types of bombs or extend the buildings in the city like with increased energy storage, faster energy recharge, or faster shooting of the main cannon. The city is not divided in several individual buildings, but as a whole. Also, if there is enough energy, a shield is protecting the town. Different types of enemies are attacking in waves, some dropping bombs, some directly attacking the town themselves.

As a bonus, the game disk contains the Kingsoft game City Defense from 1987, another Missile Command game.</desc>

		<desc>A bomb has been set by terrorists to blow up a sky-scraping hotel in which the FBI’s Central Intelligence Unit is located, and you must diffuse it. 
Reaching the room itself is no easy task, as the hotel is split into segments of 8 floors, and you can’t move onto the next one without the emergency key, which the porter has hold of – he must be located. Each of these has one eighth of the secret stop code, and these must be entered in order to finally diffuse the bomb. Secrets can be gleaned from the opposing hijackers, and from the barman. In some cases furniture can be used to your advantage. 
The whole game is similar to Impossible Mission, requiring lots of logic, puzzle-solving and structured thought.</desc>

		<desc>The player's objective, as disciple of the Headmaster, is to recover the Orb of Celestial Harmony from disciple-turned-badguy Kaimen. To do that, the player must train its body and soul in the best tradition of Chinese warriors: to "walk the path of Moebius the Windwalker." The action takes place on the four Elemental planes of Earth, Water, Air and Fire, which the player must traverse in order to recover the Orb. Although gameplay is similar to standard RPGs, there are some differences: in addition to familiar character statistics such as dexterity, the players also has karma, a crucial attribute that goes up or down constantly depending on his deeds. Frighten a citizen with a sword, and the karma will drop; defeat monsters in battle, and it will rise. Combat is also played in a 2D side-scrolling view similar to fighting games, having a wide range of attacks to use, even including shurikens and fireballs if the character is experienced enough.</desc>

Of course it is important to know where which product is needed in order to receive a good profit. This should not just be saved but also reinvested into weapon upgrades (additionally to the starting laser shot, homing missiles and mines) to survive space pirate attacks. The player may also choose to go into the pirate business and attack freighters. The ship has a high-speed travel motor to speed up the traveling time between settlements after choosing them on the navigation computer. There are also some missions to do.</desc>

If you get far enough you escape via a jetski. Level 3 has you defending yourself in Club 30 against Mr Big's task force. And the final level has you in an arena fighting Mr Big's Storm Troopers and plasma cannon as Moonwalker himself - survive and save the children.</desc>

Even Darth Vader sounds German.). Now he's been split into his 4 component parts, represented by liquid, gas, a hard ball and a bouncy ball, and he must get through 24 levels (36 on the special A1200 version - mirroring the game's plot-line of improved technology causing more problems for Morris) to retrieve the parts of the machine so it can be rebuilt to bring him back to life.

The gameplay is vaguely influenced by Lemmings, as the levels are populated by lots of points which can't be crossed in all forms - walls, fires, gaps, thornbushes and suchlike. You get a set number of transformations on each level, although extra ones can be picked up at times, and there are heaters and freezers dotted around which cause transformations in some states. All this is done against a time limit. Like Lemmings 2, you can take on the next level in each of the worlds at any time, so you have to be stuck 4 times before you can't progress.</desc>

The action is one-on-one as before, and famed for its high level of violence and blood (other than the sanitised Nintendo version). There are 5 difficulty levels and optional credits, as well as the usual two player mode including same character duels.

To win the main tournament, the player must beat each of the other human players, before taking on Shang Tsung, Kintaro and finally Shao Kahn. Players have a range of punches and kicks available, as well as flying kicks, uppercuts, roundhouses, and the special moves, which vary for each player. These include throws, uppercuts, long-distance bullets, bicycle kicks and a teleport feature.</desc>

		<desc>Five Hundred years ago, an ancient and well respected Shaolin fighting tournament, held every 50 years, was corrupted by an evil and elderly sorcerer by the name of Shang Tsung.  Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been  reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.

Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent.  When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a "Fatality" on the loser.  The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.

Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to represent the game's fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.</desc>

		<desc>If this game looks vaguely familiar, that's probably because you've seen it before, only it was called Smidge which we reckoned was  far better than most full-price games.

Morton Strikes Back is accessible with addictive gameplay and super smooth parallax scrolling, over 80 levels across 11 different worlds, many difficulty levels'. It is a platform game featuring a Mr Man type character with the legs and rickets. And penguins. As far as platform games go, there's little new or exciting about Morton. You jump on baddies' heads to kill them, collect corns and fruit for points, hearts to regain lost hit points. You start off at the left, head right and occasionally there are secret rooms to be found. The only major difference of course is the penguins.

The plain fact is that if you really feel like you need another platform game then you should download it right now, and of course you get penguins in it.</desc>

Conversations with suspects offer a wide variety of topics. The player wanders through the mansion at his own pace, but events would sometimes occur regardless of his actions.

It's essentially a platform game, but the 60 levels are reliant on you colouring in enough of the screen, by walking over it. Power ups are on offer, and the levels include some interesting design features, including ladders, spikes and springs to bounce off.

You can switch between the 3 characters (Mr Blobby, Mrs Blobby and Baby Blobby) at any point, and only lose once all 3 are out of lives. There are plenty of bad guys around, all looking identical and following pre-programmed attack paths.</desc>

		<name>Mr Do! Run Run</name>
		<desc>This game is the sequel to Mr. Do's Wild Ride and the fourth title in the "Mr. Do!" series. You control Mr. Do, a clown, and guide him trough a field with varying elevation levels, with balls placed on it. You must collect those balls to replenish your weapon, a ball that you throw at your enemies. A trail (shown as a line) follows you while moving around. The area you moved turns gray and will be uncovered. All the balls in that gray area turn into cherries. And, if you do the same with the cherries, they will be upgraded to oranges. The oranges can be upgraded to lemons and finally the lemons upgraded to pineapples. Hidden under the field is a letter (in the shape of a coin), which can be used for the "EXTRA" at the top of the screen. When any of the letters that spell the word "EXTRA" are collected an army of enemies that follows you show up and one of those enemies holds the letter that you touched. To obtain the letter you must kill that enemy. Now you can collect the other letters. When you obtained all the letters that spell the word "EXTRA" you will receive a bonus. On the field are logs, which can be unleashed by walking next to the side that is propped up. The log rolls down and kills all enemies it rolls over. But be careful! It can kill you too! To continue to the next round, you can kill all enemies or collect all the balls or fruits.</desc>

As well as enemies, there are many blocks on the levels. The weapon upgrade system is build into these, which function in two different ways. Most will drop crystals, which if collected are added to your cash total. The others reveal a picture of a weapon with a price - make contact with it while carrying enough credits and you will buy this weapon.

		<name>M.U.D.S. - Mean Ugly Dirty Sport</name>
		<desc>M.U.D.S. (Mean Ugly Dirty Sports) is a slightly humorous but definitely violent game in which the game itself is won by scoring at least 7 out of 14 goals or by killing enough of the opposing team. Tackles, pummelings, being thrown into the moat -where a shark-like thing will eat you if you don't get out on time- are just some of the things that can happen to your team.

Ofcourse, there are more ways to win: bribing the opposing team, the referee, or the creature which is used as the ball are worth considering.

Should your team need a little extra morale, just pick a fight, or buy and sell players on the slave market whenever you like.

M.U.D.S. vaguely resembles Speedball in the sense that you try to throw the ball in the opponent's goal, but that's where the resemblance ends for me.</desc>

Funny game this. The sounds and graphics were an absolute joy but the gameplay was awful. Controlling the character is close to impossible. You are given three lives but if you collect all the items you need and then die, the level is impossible to complete because you no longer have the weapon you need to beat the boss. The time limits are ridiculous and the logic needed to beat the bosses is bizarre. Add to that the 'English' translation of the story is totally incomprehensible.

Yet the graphics, sound and the fact that there is a bit of parallax scrolling thrown in to each level makes you desperately want to overlook all of the blindingly obvious flaws. There's just something about it which is addictive.</desc>

There are many various types of enemies, different on every level. Typically, enemies keep appearing and coming at you from all sides, no matter how many of them you kill - so you have to keep moving.</desc>

		<desc>Myth is a mini-adventure with about thirty locations, but because it was programmed with Magnetic Scrolls' usual adventure system, there is room for masses of text Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and that is what you will find in it. There are very few 'scenery' objects, and the messages are full and plentiful.

Set in the days of Greek mythology, you play the part of Poseidon, god of the sea. Zeus is having a temple-warming party, when he decides that gods have too easy a life Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and so he announces it is his intention to strip them of their godly powers, until such time as they succeed in a task, normally befitting a moral hero.

And it is just your luck he picks on you first Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to enter Hades and steal the fabled helmet of invisibility. Embarrassing, too, for the god of the sea, who cannot swim, and comes across deep waters early on in the game!

Do not be put off by it being a mini-adventure Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it is about the same size as a 'full size' text adventure. You get four pictures up to usual Scrolls standard, plus text undreamed of in those bygone days!</desc>

		<desc>Narc is a 1-2 player game, where your mission is to infiltrate the Mr. Big Corporation, the scourge of the underworld. To do this, you must get through the game's eight stages, with over ten sectors like the junkyard, subway, drug lab, nursery, downtown, Sunset Strip, and even the corporation, where Mr. Big resides. In order to get through the stages, you are required to collect a number of safe cards, and insert them in the slot next to the stage exit.  Each sector includes a map, and should be easy to read. For example, the blue or red dots represent you, and the white dots are the missile launchers, while the "E" indicates the exit.

Your mission ain't going to be easy, as you will come face-to-face with enemies including the canine mutts, Das Lof Gang, Dr. Spike Rush, Joe Rockhead, Kinky Pinky, Sgt. Skyhigh, HQ Posse, and Mr. Big himself. You have two ways you can deal with them: either put a bullet in them or make arrests. Furthermore, they will try to blow you up the minute they see you. Fortunately, you're armed with a shotgun and missile launcher, but these both have a limited supply of ammunition. If your bullet counter reaches one, you can only fire one bullet at a time, so you need to find some more. Also, it is important not to waste all of your missiles: you might need them later when you deal with later enemies like Mr. Big. You are also backed up by a chopper and a mean shiny street machine.

More often than not, when you blow up enemies, you can pick up several items that they drop, including drugs, money, ammunition, missile launchers, and if you're lucky, safe cards.  Even if you got the safe card and can pass the level, you can keep blowing up enemies to score more points. According to the game, this game is for training purposes only, so you will not get employed by your local DEA office. Is this what the DEA does every day: go on rampages?</desc>

The gameplay is primarily side-scrolling, but the levels are taller than the screen.</desc>

		<desc>This is a sequel to highly rated Nebulus (known as "Tower Toppler" in the US). The gameplay is much the same except this time Pogo must topple the towers and then repair them aswell! Why? Well the storyline this time around is that the evil crime boss known as "The Uncle" has taken the seven Towers of Life (which produce oxygen for their respective planets) ransom!



Because the Galactic Government does not deal with terrorists, they've sent construction worker, Pogo, to deal with the problem. This is where you come in. Pogo must (as before) make it to the top of the seven towers whilst avoiding all the baddies and traps that have been laid there for him. Once he gets to the top, the tower is toppled. Now he must would over 80% of the crumbling platforms to return power back to the tower before he can move on.</desc>

		<name>Tower Toppler</name>
		<desc>You play a small green guy who needs to blow up eight towers, because their presence is somehow poisoning the water of planets which could potentially be ideal colonies. Unfortunately you need to get to the top of these towers to blow them up.

You make your way up to the top of the tower via walkways around the outside of the towers. You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment.

The game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect.

Towers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays out as a side-scrolling collect-'em-up in which bonus points can be obtained.</desc>

		<name>New York Warriors</name>
		<desc>New York Warriors is a fun top-down shooter that recalls Quicksilver's Heavy Barrel, although it is much less well-known. As a lone commando, your job is to rescue New York City from various gangs that are wrecking havoc. Each stage takes place in a nondescript New York location, with varied backdrops and excellent attention to detail.

What makes New York Warriors a lot of fun is the variety of enemies and weapons you can pick up and use. The gangs that control each location also have their own attack styles and weapons, and naturally the challenge increases with each location you advance. Another high point is the fact that each mission's objective is different: in some locations, all you have to do is get from point A to B without getting killed, while in others you may be asked to secure a bridge by destroying guarding tanks. The action is furious, and user controls are responsive.

Fans of Cabal and similar commando-type shooters should really enjoy this one, although don't expect it to be a groundbreaking title.</desc>

		<desc>One day, a kiwi tribe was having fun and games outside the zoo, only to be kidnapped by the evil-minded Leopard Seal, who plans to sell them at the black market. Fortunately, during the kidnapping process, Tiki, leader of the tribe, managed to escape the sack, and her job is to rescue Phee-Phee and the other kiwis scattered around New Zealand, and are held in cages in various locations that include Auckland, Rotorua, Waitomo Caves, Strait Cook, and Mt. Cook. 

If Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. 

In some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.</desc>

There are two courses, plus a hidden 9-hole course on Mars with reduced gravity, with match play and stroke play options against one of 8 varied-difficulty computer players.

The control system is quite unusual, as the strength of the shot is chosen before you start the swing, but you have to click within a range to activate the shot, and this range is narrower if your shot is intended to be more powerful. An extra click can be made to add wrist snap, which increases the shot's power. The wind calculation is more complicated than most games of the era, and the rough is harder to play out of than usual, as you can't make slight stance adjustments easily.</desc>

During the travels, Nicky is able to move around the levels, jump over obstacles, and duck to avoid flying threats. Nicky must collect gems, flying bombs, dynamite, keys, and other specific objects. These are used for tasks such as building a bridge over river throwing logs, climbing ladders, using teleporters, or to break the walls to find the secret areas. 

Enemy creatures are taken out by throwing apple remnants at them or jumping on them. Nicky's energy is drained if he makes contact with them in any other way. As you do all this, a score is calculated, and then listed in the high score table. Passwords are offered to allow you to resume from a previously-reached level.</desc>

		<desc>Nigel Mansell's first licensed computer game recreates all 16 Formula 1 circuits of the time, viewed from behind the car but with a full cockpit-type view below. This is important because the game is very much a simulation rather than an action game.

Before each race you have to do three qualifying laps, and only make the grid if you are fast enough to meet the pre-defined qualifying limit. The races can be between 5 and 20 laps, or at full length if you prefer - fortunately a half-finished season can be saved to cassette or disk. 

F1 cars of this era have turbo boosts, and this is available in the game to provide a quick blast of extra speed, which is useful for overtaking but can cause the turbo or the engine itself to be overstressed, as well as using fuel more quickly (pitstops are for tires but not fuel, again in keeping with the era's real Formula 1 rules).</desc>

The game was pitched somewhere in between a full-blown simulation like F1 GP and action games like Continental Circus. Only 12 cars were in each race, which could last from between 3 and 20 laps.

Before each race you can customize wing downforce, gear ratio, tyre selection and fuel load choices – pitstops are a standard feature of the longer races. The 16-bit versions include a unique 'Improve With Mansell' mode, in which a digitized version of Nigel's head appears in the top corner of the screen, offering instructions and praise.</desc>

His attempts at gaining acceptable go wrong when he is bitten by a cannibal, and the Police of Earth find Midian and set out to destroy it. Boone must stop them.

The game has several different sequences, most arcade based, trying to bring sequences from the movie to life on the computer screen. There are eight action types from driving to Midian, running from Peloquin the cannibal, or fighting 'The Mask', a serial killer whom Boone is mistaken for.</desc>

Navigating the maze and finding the means to overcome the doors (finding keys) and barriers (finding switches) is the main challenge of the game, but there are also mines, turrets and patrolling robots. During the course of a level there are optional and needed upgrades to find, e.g. a cannon (initially the tank can't shoot), a mine detector, extra energy or a radar.</desc>

		<desc>NightHunter is a Dracula based action/adventure in which you actually get to play as Count Dracula. Dracula will have the ability to transform into a bat and a werewolf.  Your goal is to locate holy medallions in order to create total chaos on Earth.  Of course, Van Helsing and his band of vampire hunters are on your trail, so they must be avoided so you don't get dusted.  Enemies encountered include priests with holy water, vultures, and even the police.

NightHunter is a traditional side scrolling platform game that is made up of 30 levels.  Each level has 20 screens.  To advance to the next level 8 objects must be collected; 3 parchments and 5 keys.  Every 5th level you obtain one of the medallions.

Beware of daybreak! You will die if you don't locate a crypt to protect yourself from the sunlight.</desc>

The player(s) controlled robot Ninjas, which battled their way through the levels using Shuriken and knives. As the Ninja's took damage their classic Ninja garb was torn away to reveal robotic limbs, torso or head. When the damage reached critical the Ninja Robot would explode, scattering mechanical body parts.

As with the follow-up, players take the role of three different heroes - Doug, the smart safe cracker; Dino, the strong, but dumb, boxer; and Donna, the sexy club dancer. 

The game takes place in Tokyo. While all three characters explore almost the same areas, each of the heroes has their own story to follow and puzzles to solve. You can choose which character you would like to play first and when you have finished all three sub-plots, you'll get a final with all three characters acting altogether.

The game features cartoonish, comics-style graphics, unique icon-based interface and non-linear plot. It is also full of Italian humour, and the game is played more like a comedy, rather then crime-based adventure.</desc>

		<name>Nitro</name>
		<desc>Nitro is an top-down perspective arcade racer for the Amiga and Atari ST. It was developed and published in 1990 by Psygnosis.

This game contains no clear background or storyline, just white-knuckle video game racing. After choosing whether to play with one, two or three (via keyboard) players, the player(s) must select a car and buy accessories at the "pit stop" before proceeding to the race. Three vehicles are available; namely the racing car, sports car, and turbo buggy. Accessories include nitros, high speed, acceleration, traction, fix damage, a change of car, as well as fuel which is imperative to the racing campaign.

The game consists of 32 levels, but the game ends when the fuel is depleted. To prevent this, the player must finish in a high place on most races, which rewards the player with up to 600 gasoline units. In addition, power-ups float around in the levels as well as being placed on the track, but these may be picked up by any of the four cars.

There are four different environments. Starting on city roads, the player advance through forest and desert tracks before playing the last levels in a wasteland terrain. (Evidently, the Nitro story is that the apocalypse occurs, and the races go on. "The end of the world is nigh" is graffitied on the track.) Every four races there are night levels, which means that the screen is pitch-black save for the small area illuminated by headlights. Double headlights are available as a floating power-up.

Obstacles during races are commonplace. Examples are cones and holes in the road, which mainly slow down the player, and (blue) oil spillage which causes the car to spin. The Nitro manual makes reference to pedestrians, and says that in some races extra points are given for hitting pedestriansÃ¢â‚¬â€however During a replay only 1 of the 32 levels has a message prior to entering the race, mentioning : money awarded for hitting pedestrians.

Nitro was also available as part of the Psygnosis monster pack, volume I, along with the original Shadow of the Beast and Infestation. The "monsters" in the game may refer to the playersÃ¢â‚¬â€namely, Clint Eastwood (P1Ã¢â‚¬â€white), Rambo (P2Ã¢â‚¬â€yellow), and James Bond (P3Ã¢â‚¬â€red).</desc>

The game has average graphics and relatively good music, but the controls are horrible. The basic idea is well known - you must climb up the level to escape the raising water level.

I remember the fuss with magazines banging on about demo coders should be making games, and this game shows why that wasn't necessarily the case.</desc>

		<desc>There is indeed no second prize in this race between 6 of the world’s toughest riders. First prize is the one remaining model of the greatest motorbike the world has ever seen, incidentally.

The graphics are polygon based, with lots of roadside detail, and leaning into corners to maximise turn-in leads to the graphics to tilt appropriately. The control is mouse-based, allowing for slight adjustments to be made and ensuring that the controls are realistic but not impossible. As well as your five rivals, there are lots of Sunday riders on the roads, distinguished by having brown bikes, so make sure to avoid these.

This was one of the first games to feature video-style replays, allowing you to find the exact moment you want to replay, from any part of the race, and view it at normal speed, double-speed, or freeze-frame. The camera angles on offer here include one that follows the bike, one that views the track from the side, and a TV-style chase view.</desc>

		<desc>Nuclear War is a single player turn-based strategy game developed by New World Computing and released for the Amiga in 1989 and later for MS-DOS. It presents a satirical, cartoonish nuclear battle between five world powers, in which the winner is whoever retains some population when everyone else on earth is dead.
The game's introduction includes an homage to Dr. Strangelove. Each player - one human, four computer-controlled - is represented by a caricature of a national leader (the MS-DOS version allowed more than one human player). If there is a computer-controlled winner at the end of the game, that leader is depicted jumping for joy in the middle of a blasted wasteland, crowing "I won! I won!". If the player wins only the high score board is shown. Once a player (computer or human) loses, all of their stockpiled weapons are automatically launched. It's possible for a game to have no winner because of this. If this happens, a cut scene of the earth shattering and exploding is shown, and the high score table appears (though without any new entries).</desc>

The player controls a space ship and must destroy the electric core of a synthetic planet called Cetorium to defeat a dangerous alien race. He flies left to right and collects bonuses and power ups to increase the ship's firepower. Extra weapons look like the levitating options from Gradius,but there are several types. Various enemies have to be shot and at the end of levels there are fights against large bosses. The game has a specific organic/plant style with resemblance to X Multiply. Most of the enemies aren't space ships but rather bugs and bacteria-like creatures. Also the game's environments look organic. The game has one-hit-death and the player has only a few ships to use. There are six stages.</desc>

Of course there are a variety of power ups to collect on the way, including seven weapons, smart bombs, extra lives, weapon upgrades or extra speed.

The gameplay consists of a combination of arcade elements and first person view much like Eye of the Beholder and Dungeon Master.  One of the more remarkable features is in the first person mode, rather than having just 4 directs to face and flicking between them there are 8 directions and the view scrolls smoothly as you turn. This smooth scrolling continues when you move forward, giving the game more of a 3D feel.

The arcade elements consist of horizontal scrolling areas where you fight enemies with your bow while avoiding their attacks.  Later you encounter a similar type of gameplay that involves exploring castles and adds 4 directional movement.</desc>

Obliterator is an arcade style platform action game. The game screens are static (instead of scrolling, though you can optionally turn on scrolling transitions between screens.) and can be maze like at times with many locations to search. Armed with a variety of weapons, you have to board the alien spacecraft, disable its weapons, plasma drives and shields, then escape.</desc>

The first three are available right from the start and the others gradually open up as a more crystals are found. A lot of time is spent with jumping over gaps and fighting the uncle's soldier with the sword, but there are many puzzles to solve. Much consists of the standard "finding an object and bringing it to the right spot", but the big catch is that the hero can transform into animals, e.g. a lion or a bird. Each animal has their own set of abilities which are needed to solve the obstacles the game throws at the player.</desc>

You can choose one of four main goals, from topping the market in 3 years to total domination. Plenty of dirty tricks to help you are on offer, from setting fire to opponent's rigs to stealing the storage tanks which hold the oil in place. Private investigators can be hired to either prevent to prove these things.

Although primarily a strategy game, a few short action sequences are also included. These come into play when attempting to drill for oil (you can hire a specialist to do this instead, but the cost is prohibitive in the early stages), to build oil pipelines around those of your opponents, and to extinguish any fires opponents start on your rig.</desc>

Accidentally, Colin has been digitized and curlified into his computer at the moment he completed the final level of the game. Colin has been trapped inside his own computer and an amazing array of challenges are standing between him and the escape from this electronic nightmare.

You have to move Colin Curly from the ENTRY packet to the EXIT packet by jumping from one platform to the next. Colin can only escape from a level if ALL the platforms have shut before he reaches the exit.

As Colin steps off a platform, it will slide shut behind him, never to open again unless it has special properties.  So, it is important to work out the correct route to follow in order to close all the platforms before Colin reaches the EXIT while still being able to move around the level.</desc>

The game plays a lot like the more well-known Pang. Each level is a single screen, and to complete it, you have to destroy some bouncing asteroids. If you touch one of them, or the time runs out, you lose one life.

Your weapon is some sort of harpoon, that can only shoot straight up. When it hits an asteroid, the asteroid splits into two smaller versions of itself, unless it's already the smallest variant. If that's the case, it finally gets destroyed. When all asteroids are destroyed, you travel to the next star. Repeat this 100 times, and your ship will be completed, and the game is won.

You can also get different bonus-items, such as a gun, time-stoppers, shields making you temporarily invulnerably, and other stuff.</desc>

		<desc>Operation Harrier is an action game starring Britain's famous VTOL aircraft. It uses an enhanced version of the Rotoscape system first used in Creative Materials' earlier Rotox: the own plane is seen from the top and when steering left or right the polygonally rendered background rotates around it. A new addition is the ability to change altitude. The game consists of several missions, each with a specific goal like destroying an enemy cruiser or power plant or defending an airfield from enemy fighters. Before a mission, the Harrier can be armed with a variety of weapons, including air-to-air and air-to-ground missiles as well as two types of bombs. Standard armament is a forward-firing cannon with unlimited ammunition. A radar screen and a map help finding the enemy during a mission. Fuel is limited, but in some missions in-air refueling is possible. While the Harrier can survive a few hits, it can also be repaired (and refueled) after mission's end. Sometimes it is also possible to make a mid-mission resupply landing at a friendly base.</desc>

		<name>Operation Thunderbolt</name>
		<desc>Operation Thunderbolt is the exciting sequel to Operation Wolf. An airliner is hijacked by terrorists en-route from Paris to Boston, who threaten to kill all hostages on board if their mates aren't released from jail. Instead of reaching its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for the ride.

There are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.

You also have a life bar to worry about. If you're shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, and once you're energy is depleted,  you lose one of your three lives. You can lose a lot of energy by killing hostages on purpose,  and you can't easily avoid killing them if you decide to use rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth mission, the mission that involves you fighting terrorists on a plane,  proves to be difficult because a woman in a blue dress stands up and gets in the line of fire, and you have to very careful when you're going to use rocket bombs.

There are two endings to this game, and which ending you can watch will depend on the number of hostages you've saved, and whether or not you shot the pilot instead of the mission eight boss.</desc>

		<desc>You have been recruited for Operation Wolf, a desperate attempt to rescue prisoners from the enemy. Through a series of missions, you'll engage a variety of enemies, from soldiers to ninjas, patrol boats to helicopters, and more. Can you carry the day?

Operation Wolf is an arcade conversion of the game by Taito. It is essentially a bitmapped "rail-shooter", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to "pick them up". Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds. 

You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around which can be shot, but it's not beneficial. 

Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.</desc>

		<desc>The Oriental Games offer skilled martial artists the chance to prove themselves in Kung Fu, Kendo and the relatively brutal Kyo-Kus-Hin-Kai., using “courage, skill and flare” (sic) according to the packaging. It makes for a series of one-on-one fights viewed from the side.

Kendo involves using a stick as your weapon, whereas Kung Fu various punches and kicks and Kyo-Kus-Hin-Kai involves head butts and flying attacks. You can jump over opponents; a quick tap of the fire button turns you around. You have an energy bar with 5 blocks of gradually decreasing colours, which drops when you are hit and increases as you pass time without being hit. Impressive moves earn you bonus Merit Awards.

On the 16-bit versions, there are 3 skill levels (Novice, Professional and Master), digitised sound, and an editor to set up joystick moves. The 8-bit versions lack these niceties, but include an extra discipline, Sumo; these are played in sequence rather than by choice.</desc>

		<name>Ork Attack - The Return</name>
		<desc>1994 saw the release of Action game called Ork Attack: The Return on the Amiga systems, created and published by Ian West for free as a Public Domain.

Essentially this is a game in which the player patrols the top of the castle and drops rocks onto the Orkish enemies who are trying to scale the wall. Should an Ork make it to the top then the player can call for their trusty sword and chop of the offending invaders head. What makes this game difficult is that there can only ever be one rock on screen at a time and while the player is holding their sword no new rocks will appear.

Randomly throughout the game a chief Ork will appear. They ascend slower than their companion Orks and can only be killed by dropping a rock on their head. If a chief makes it to the top then it's game over. Between levels there is a time limited bonus round where the player must sweep defeated Ork bodies into the moat.</desc>

A sidescrolling action-adventure developed by WJS Design and published by Psygnosis (Shadow of the Beast, Leander), Ork features five expansive levels characteristic of Psygnosis games of the era. While slightly similar to the same firm's earlier Killing Game Show, Ork's presentation is more polished, and the gameplay is less hectic.

In addition to blasting enemies, the player must complete tasks reminiscent of adventure games. Examples including locating and delivering a payment to a gate keeper, finding a specific key to open a door, or locating an orb to deflect lasers.</desc>

However, there are also blocks in the way which need to be destroyed by ramming them into each other.

In order to keep the ship from crashing into non-destroyable blocks, the player has to connect to the ship and change the direction it steers to.

		<desc>Overdrive is practically two games in one. First, you have the arcade game, where you have to race against a succession of drivers, each better than the one before, until you reach the final challenge and claim victory. The second game is a time-trials challenge, where you have to race a variety of vehicles over a number of courses against the clock. This is slightly easier than the arcade version and gives you the option to get some practice in.

You have four different cars to control in Overdrive, ranging from a GP to a Super sports car. All have their own strengths and weaknesses, as you would expect. The controls are very responsive, and it goes without saying that it's incredibly playable. What makes it so tough is the speed. Everything just whips along at such a rate that it's often hard to anticipate corners, and you end up careering all over the shop. Overdrive lets you link up two machines via the null modem cable.

Of course, it can't all be good, or it would have got a mark of 100%. The biggest problem is the horrendous loading times. As the levels vary greatly, the game has to load in complete graphics for each race, which can take a lot longer than the race itself in some cases!</desc>

Before setting off, you can buy upgrades such as turbo chargers, armour and enhanced weapons, each of which has a limited lifespan.

		<name>Overlord</name>
		<desc>Overlord is a real-time strategic warfare game where the player must manage large standing armies, economic capital, and political stability throughout a number of extra-dimensional star systems. 

As the dictatorial ruler of the Epsilon Galaxy, the player has obtained complete, indisputable authority. However, during a scientific experiment in hyperdrive technology, Epsilon scientists discovered four "buffer" dimensions, each containing a number of barren planets that exist between the Epsilon Galaxy and another alien dimension. Unfortunately, the most powerful empires from these alternate dimensions have also just discovered these zones through their own experiments. The player must battle these alien species for control of these buffer worlds, to ensure that their rule in the Epsilon Galaxy remains intact.

To make the new planets useful in the player's campaign, they can purchase terraforming equipment which can transform them into tropical Gaian-esque worlds which are ideal for agriculture, mineral-rich and heavily volcanic worlds, desert planets capable of producing vast amounts of energy, or ecologically balanced planets that can support large cities which are readily able to generate significant income through taxation. In addition, the player can mine for resources and tax their citizens to raise money, construct spaceship-buildings to feed the populace, enlist soldiers and equip them, buy battle cruisers or other craft to move from planet to planet, and so on. The player can fight battles, colonize planets, and even spy on alien races. The end goal is to ensure that the other alien races do not gain the upper hand by conquering these four new dimensions before the player can.

The player cannot retreat from battle, as the only way to shut down the hyperspace link from their universe to Epsilon would be by vaporizing the player's homeworld, which is where the hyperspace generator is located. Politically (at the very least), this is not an option.

Blood will have to be shed for supremacy of the hyperspace planets, and for the player to become Overlord of these four new dimensions plus their own.</desc>

The objective in each mission is usually to take control of key areas, destroy enemy communications, escort support groups, etc. In a nice touch, missions may be undertaken at any time of the day; night missions surprisingly being the easiest, as the enemy has inferior Infrared imaging to your tanks.

The graphics could be best described as 'functional', they certainly aren't to the standards of other war sims like Gunship 2000, but the functions are well laid out, simple and extremely easy to use.

Overall, Pacific Islands is an improvement over Team Yankee, although interface and dumb AI problems still remain. Once the initial problems of controlling 4 groups of 4 tanks are overcome, the rest of the game is quite easy to get into, and very rewarding. Recommended if you like tank sims, but don't expect it to be very realistic.</desc>

		<desc>Pac-Land is a side-scrolling 1-2 player game with a cartoony feel to it. Now equipped with arms, face, and legs, Pac must guide a fairy back to her home in Fairy Land, but this task will not be easy because Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde, and Sue will pursue Pac-Man as he travels through Pac-Land. When he finally transports the fairy back to her home, Pac is given some magic shoes, which will help him get to his own home, where he will be greeted by his family: Ms. Pac-Man, Baby Pac-Man, Chomp Chomp, and Sourpuss. 

There are sixteen rounds to complete, with four trips each. During each round, he can grab a power pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use a springboard to jump over a lake. He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.</desc>

		<desc>Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man. You need to guide Pac-Man around a maze and eat all of the dots on the board in order to proceed on to the next round. Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!</desc>

		<desc>The Paladin is the ultimate warrior on the battlefield, he leads forces and is the master of swordsmanship. But Paladins are not born with these abilities. They must be trained and tested in many missions to obtain knighthood.

Paladin is an overhead turn-based strategy game played on various tiles. Players take a phase followed by enemies taking a phase. All actions, including movement will use up some of a character's MP (Movement Points). Possible actions include movement, opening doors, picking up items, using items, casting spells or attacking friends and foes on adjacent squares. Each quest is loaded up individually, though some quests may contain multiple maps. The paladin is the only character who can be transfered to any map and the only character to gain experience and new abilities.

The game features a level editor for creation of one's own quests, the game itself comes with 10 quests. New Paladins are also built from this editor. One paladin ("Brandon") comes ready-made with the game.</desc>

		<desc>Pang is a platform game which consists of 50 levels in total. It can be played with one or two players on the same screen, and the other player can join anytime within the game. 

Your goal is to destroy the balloons which bounce around the playfield. To accomplish this, you can shoot hooks which travel upwards, and blow up any balloon they touch. Depending on their size, they either split on two smaller ones, or evaporate if they're at their minimum size. Apart from balloons, some levels also have barriers that have to be destroyed with your hooks, since they often block your access to balloons. There are also some barriers which cannot ever be destroyed. Your character has the ability to climb ladders, but cannot jump. 

You can also pick up power-ups such as: the ability to fire two shots at once, the hook that attaches to the ceiling and waits 'til something bumps into it, a gun which has a high rate of fire but cannot destroy barriers. Beside extra weapons, you can also pick certain things like clock (halting time for a small period), dynamite (reducing all balls to minimum size, thus making you able to reach more points), life, and such.</desc>

A fleet of space freighters carry a cargo of battle and security robots to help in the defence of Basmyth. Alien ships were bombarding the freighters with disorienting beams which drove the robots crazy. The human officers were eliminated, leaving the ships open for occupation by alien forces. At this point the players mission starts...

You control a cybernetic influence device (ID) which has been teleported aboard the first freighter to eliminate all the droids and robots. Two ways are possible to clean the ship decks representing the action part and the more strategy part of the game: Shooting (action) to destroy the robots or connecting itself into an other robot's brain (strategy) and take temporarily control of it.

It's possible to play the game as a simple shoot-em-up game, but the main part of Paradroid 90 is the transfer game to take control of other droids.</desc>

After collecting a disk from the body and bringing it to a special terminal, money and promotions wait as reward.

Money is essential because it is used to buy things like weapons, ammo or food. In regular intervals, the player has to take a personality test with yes/no answers and questions like "Are you a fascist pig?". Failing to answer correctly causes the player to become the hunted instead of the hunter.</desc>

Honest John the trader and Kronos the Magician play a key role in your journey, each offering sub-quests to attempt.

The package includes a novella complete with map and decipherable hints, which are accessed by typing 'hint' followed by the code into the computer. Therefore, those with only a pirated copy would struggle to complete the game.

Playing as the hero Perseus, you have to go to 5 different worlds, each with its own theme, and kill Satan's guardians (end of level bosses). 
A friendly wizard has also given you a magical flying horse called Pegasus, to help you in your quest.

Each world has 10 levels, and half of them are played flying on Pegasus back, and the other half walking, without your magical horse. When flying, the game plays like a Shoot'em up, but when walking, it's a platform game, and you have to rely on your sword.

You can buy weapon upgrades and other bonuses, if you collect enough diamonds. They can be found spread out all over the levels, and fallen enemies drop them sometimes as well. If your health drops too low, you can also heal yourself by spending some diamonds.

After every world, you get a password, letting you continue from the same place the next time you play. That's fortunate, because this game takes a long time to complete.</desc>

Two opponents (the second either human or AI) compete on a 8x8 grid field.

The catch is that one player can move the cursor only horizontally and the other is restricted to vertical movements. The game ends when no more moves are possible and the player with the most points wins.</desc>

		<name>Peter Beardsley's International Football</name>
		<desc>Licensed around former England player Peter Beardsley, this football (soccer) game is viewed side-on. The only playing option is the European Championship tournament of the day, although you can choose the 8 teams from the 26 major European footballing nations of the time (so the USSR, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia are all still complete). Two players can compete in these groups, but there's no guarantee of getting straight to a 2-player game, especially as tournaments (and individual matches) can't be quit out of.

The gameplay features variable strength kicks, determined by how long you hold the fire button for. In a break with realistic physics, the ball ricochets back in the direction it came from. Goalkeepers stay on the goal-line rather than using the whole penalty box.</desc>

		<desc>Graeme Souness Soccer Manager is a basic football managing game based on the English leagues where the player is responsible for bringing a team (any available) from the Conference to the top division. Options are limited: the player can select the starting eleven, the players being rated in both ability and fitness, explore the transfer market for signing better players and request overdraft extensions. While no player refuses the sign for your team (even if it's still on the Conference), the real game challenge is to balance finances, and avoid paying too much in wages while still in the lower divisions.</desc>

		<desc>European Tour is best thought of as a remake of the original game, rather than a sequel as such. It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 top European pros, rather than the US-leaned lineup of the original. The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering the intervening years of advances in programming skill.

The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect.

As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.</desc>

		<desc>PGA Tour Golf introduced many of the conventions commonly seen in the genre since. The three-click control method (the first to start the swing, the second setting power and over-swing, the third setting draw or fade) allowed for a multitude of different shots, and required a sense of timing. 

Four courses are included, one of them a fantasy 'links' course designed by the programmers. Some of the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water hazards and trees, and the need to plan strategies to get the best approach to the green.

When playing a tournament there are 60 opponents, each representing top US golfers - ten of these appear in the game, with one providing tactical advice for each hole.</desc>

You can rotate the direction of fire while holding fire down, allowing you to move one way and fire another way (another Minter tradition - witness Llamatron). A Boost function exists to power up your ship, including plutonium pods which unusually can be collected and harvested by the end-of-level enemies as well as your own ship. After the main levels you must steer the ship through a tight tunnel, avoiding contact with the walls.</desc>

To recollect the vegetables he must first stun them, either by firing at them or jumping on them, then walk over them, in a manner similar to Fire &amp; Ice.

		<desc>Pinomania is a puzzle board game, a clone of a classic game Pentomino with the appearance of as a static Tetris. The goal of the player is to fill a pattern picture with all the available blocks. The blocks may be turned in every direction and flipped. Each level allows to make a designated number of checks, showing correct placed blocks. The blocks may be removed from the board back to the clipboard. There is no limit of trials. After completing the level players receive a level code. The game consists of 80 levels all together, all use the same set of 12 blocks.</desc>

		<name>Pipe Mania</name>
		<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.</desc>

		<desc>Take on the life of a buccaneer in the golden age of Caribbean Piracy! This game lets you choose from 6 different "ages" (for example, "The Silver Empire" from 1560-1600, "War For Profit" from 1640-1660, etc.), one of 4 nationalities (English, French, Dutch, Spanish), 4 difficulty levels, and one of 5 special abilities (skill at fencing, skill at navigation, etc.). Nine different types of ships were represented. 

The goal of the game is to retire with as much gold and land as possible, as many ranks/titles as possible (Colonel, Admiral, Marquis, Duke), and a wife. Finding long lost relatives helps too. You accomplish these goals by plundering cities, capturing and sinking enemy ships, getting in good with governors to receive titles, learn news of "evil Spaniards" holding your relatives, capturing evil pirates, etc.  

The game is educational, as you will learn about piracy through the thoroughly researched manual. You'll smell the sea salt as you participate in wild sword fights, desperate sea battles, and daring attacks by land!</desc>

		<name>Platoon</name>
		<desc>The film Platoon featured a squad of five soldiers on their mission for the US Army in Vietnam. In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them.

The game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.

The next section is in first-person 3D, as you move through a network of tunnels in search of flares and a compass. There are 3 distinct control methods, changing from the standard motion when an enemy appears (this puts you in control of a cross-hair for more accurate targeting), and when you enter a room to search.

After escaping this you settle in a bunker overnight, and have a limited amount of flares with which to locate incoming enemy, and must then shoot them before they can shoot you. The jungle airstrike from the film is the next moment - you have two minutes to rush into a safe position to the north, using your compass for guidance.

Finally you face the treacherous Sergeant Barnes, and must hit him with grenades 5 times whilst trapped in a foxhole to prevent him wiping you out.</desc>

		<desc>When this game arrived in it was hard to find any difference, apart from the obvious graphical ones and a bit more speed in the player section, between it and the original.

Your aim in Player Manager 2 Extra is to raise a team from division 2 capable of winning promotion to the Premier League as well as competing in Europe. You are pitted against three other managers who can be either computer or human controlled. These guys are pretty smart too.

The big change in PM2 Extra is that the graphics have all been upgraded. The tactics editor is still brilliant though. If this is your area of interest then PM2E stands out as the best.

All in all, PM2E is a very competent management simulator and if you like the Kick Off series then you'll enjoy the Kick Off playing engine. Though still a solid game it's not that much better than the first version to warrant an upgrade (A1200) unless you're a real fan.</desc>

		<name>Player Manager 2</name>
		<desc>Player Manager 2 sets you as an international-standard soccer player who's stepped into being a player-manager at a lower-division side. The challenge is to reach the Premier League and survive.

Most of the standard features of management games are present, including pre-match tactics (which are fairly customizable), a full transfer market including short-term loan deals, detailed player statistics (presented visually), ground improvements and coaching.

Playing the matches is optional, as you can simply watch instead. There are 4 playing views, and you can play in position or as a team. Initially your player is by far the best in the team, so choose his position and use him wisely. Once you reach retirement age you can only play the matches for 3 out of every 4 seasons (which is poorly explained by an 'assistant manager' concept, but is more likely an attempt to make the game harder. This would make little sense though, because scoring is very, very hard in player-manager mode).

Before each match you get a video report from renowned pundit Alan Hansen, as well as some form notes which are said to be Hansen's.</desc>

Four tactical systems are provided, but you can design your own and put it to the test in various situations using a raytrace system. Training sessions are presented visually, allowing you to pinpoint the exact ability and potential of a player.

The playing side of the game uses the Kick Off game engine. After a few seasons your player's ability fades and you eventually have to retire form playing and concentrate on management. You can however save your team and import it into Kick Off 2</desc>

Many of the enemies you face are waves of laser fodder with movement patterns taking them around the screen, with gun turrets and firing enemies as well, to fight or avoid. You start with 4 lives, and get an extra one (and a 5000 point bonus) after every level.

In many similar shoot 'em ups, you have unlimited fuel but must pick up ammunition recharges or increased powerups. Plutos lacks weapon upgrades, but rather inventively forces you to refuel, by shooting at posts which contain fuel (there are also bays for 500 bonus points marked out). Each level finishes with an enemy with eyes shooting at you, and from level 3 there are teeth mounted in front which fire at you.</desc>

		<name>Police Quest 2 : The Vengeance</name>
		<desc>Little time has passed since the events of Police Quest, when Sonny Bonds climbed the ranks of the Lytton police department and became the key element in the arrest of Jesse Bains, the notorious drug lord. After the trial, Sonny's application to the Homicide division was accepted and proposed to Marie, who had her prostitution charges dropped and started a new life away from the streets. Life was good - until Bains escaped, taking advantage of a low-security prison and an inexperienced correctional officer. Sonny is now in danger from a vengeful Bains and is saddled with his new chain-smoker partner Keith. Sonny goes to the field again to capture Bains, but things are about to get awfully personal...

Using Sierra's new SCI engine, the graphics are more vibrant than in the first game, but gameplay remains basically the same, with the player ordering Sonny to move to a place in the scene (either using the directional keys or the new mouse interface) and a parser interface to interact with the game world. Game sequences are more varied, and include a shooting range, an underwater search or searching the inside of an escape vehicle. The driving sequences are gone, and the player can relax while reading the chatter between Sonny and Keith as they move from location to location. The approach to the game, however, is radically different. While the first (for a large part) is based on street police work, this sequel is oriented into forensics field work such as collecting evidences that link Bains into the happenings of the game.</desc>

However, a series of gruesome murders perpetrated by a sinister cult known as "The Kindred" shocks the city. Marie becomes a victim of their attack and falls into a coma. It becomes Sonny's very personal mission to track down the attackers and make them pay for their crimes.

The Kindred is the third installment of the Police Quest series, its events taking place after those described in The Vengeance. The game brings back some of the elements of the first game, such as a modified version of driving sequences and police procedures unrelated to the main plot the protagonist must go through. Computer work is particularly emphasized, requiring the player to perform tasks such as using facial composite software or figuring out murder patterns by studying a map. Like other Sierra adventures of the time, the game uses an icon-based interface for interaction with the environment.</desc>

A typical Sierra parser game built with the popular AGI engine, Police Quest differs from the others release by the company in the realism of the setting and travelling, that is done by car, controlled by the player using a overhead view (instead of the cabbie of Leisure Suit Larry or walking around in Space Quest). Some sections of the game require the player to be efficient driving the car (as there are a fair number of chases, and traffic rules also apply to the player).</desc>

The control method is divided into two distinct parts: first the basic position of the cue is set in a top down view. After that the game switches to a first-person perspective where the player can fine-tune the cue to select the spin (the game gives the parameters of the current position). Finally the shot is performed with a mouse click. For both parts the player is on a time limit of about ten seconds each.</desc>

		<name>Popeye 2</name>
		<desc>Strange happenings are afoot once again in Sweethaven and only Popeye can make it right. In Popeye 2, our spinach lovin' hero must once again rescue Olive Oyl and make mincemeat of Bluto while looking after Swee'Pea, feeding Wimpy and keeping an eye on Jeep.

Popeye has four different levels to traverse through. His initial adventure takes him to a construction site where bouncing springs, falling girders and open welding flames impede his progress. Rolling barrels, and bombs which must be touched to be put out also stand to cause harm. In every level scattered hamburgers must be collected in order for Popeye to get past Wimpy who is often hanging out somewhere near the top of every vertically scrolling platform level. There are also feats of strength that Popeye must perform by beating up a punching robot-type thing with the aid of Spinach. Once past all these obstacles Popeye can move on to the next level.

The second level takes Popeye into the urban jungle where he must climb the side of the Biff Spinach building and avoid the same obstacles as in the previous levels. In the third level falling girders are replaced with giant bananas as Popeye finds himself in a jungle. Coconut throwing monkeys hang from ledges and snoozing tigers and snakes decorate the trees. The fourth and final level of the game finds Popeye climbing the masts of the S.S. Trev and the S.S. Andy as he makes his way to a final confrontation with Bluto and rescue Olive Oyl.

Popeye is able to jump around and occasionally when the situation calls for it punch his way through this vertical platformer. Bonus points are rewarded for finding Swee'Pea and Jeep. He can take multiple hits before he takes a curtain call but thankfully is unharmed by long drops. The player should beware as Popeye has only one life to get through the four levels of this adventure.</desc>

		<name>Populous</name>
		<desc>You play a god, gaming against other gods in a celestial game of conquest.  To win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the vermin who worship that other god.

Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness.  Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not.  To get win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on.  The more followers you have you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same.

When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero.  He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy.  When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people.  He will burn; he will kill.  And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.

But you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the god's have other tools as well.  You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers.  Submerge their towns in swamps. Raise a volcano in the middle of their best farmland.  Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who didn't build on high-ground. 

And when you win, you'll have 500 more worlds to conquer.  A god's play is just never done.</desc>

Where are all the humans? Upon returning from your 100 year voyage in the milky way, you find earth empty and abandoned. Between the decaying remnants of civilization, you discover a terminal for Worldnet, the global network that recorded all human activities. The answer must lie deep in its database. Anxious, you log on.

Portal is a unique attempt of creating and adapting a novel specifically for the computer. The story of the boy Peter Devore, his incredible discovery and the mysterious portal are told by an AI named Homer, who reconstructs it piece by piece out of database fragments. As the plot develops, you acquire accompanying information by accessing eleven additional databases - for example a historical archive, military files or social backgrounds. As you switch between the databases to uncover new details, an extensive sci-fi story unfolds.</desc>

		<desc>The Powerdrome racing series is now into its 24th year of high-speed high-octane action. Why race on flat 2D circuits when you can charge through a multi-textured half-pipe in small aircraft? Typhoon Racing have taken up the challenge, and entered you in their machine.

There are 6 different circuits, with hazards including chicanes, tunnels and crusher gates. Shading to the sections marks out whether a corner or dive is coming up. There are 5 computer opponents to race against in one player mode, while a data link cable allows 2-player games.

Each planet has its own atmosphere, and your machine's filters will need to be set to take account of this. Rain on some circuits necessitates a pitstop for a changeover. You are armed with afterburners, which can provide a speed use in open air but should not be overused. The Amiga version allows you to adjust the sensitivity of the controls - either way, joystick is easier to use but mouse is seen as ultimately being faster.</desc>

Gods take it in turns to decide on a piece and answer a trivia question. Get it right and you're allowed to move the appropriate character one square in any direction on the multi-coloured board. Try to move on to a square occupied by an opponent piece and you're in for a fightÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ well, a challenge really. Lose a challenge and you're demoted a character grade. There's no grade lower than one so if a grade one piece loses a head-to-head it vaporises and disappears from the board. There's just one snag. If you make all your opponents disappear there's going to be nobody left to praise the smartypants. Serves you right, clever clogs!</desc>

		<desc>In this platform game featuring over 2500 screens, our hero is in search of hidden treasures across worlds such as caves and castles, and must collect it all to advance onto the next level. The twist, as you may guess from the title, is that his weapon is a hammer which can be used to burrow into the ground. The blocks quickly reappear though, which can be fatal if they trap him, but can also be used by the cunning player to trap an enemy. 

Not all the platforms and transporters on the levels are visible, which guarantees an element of Rick Dangerous-style trial and error. You have six lives, which isn't much considering that failing to complete a level within the time limit costs a life, and contact with enemies is costly (you can't drill through them Worms-style)</desc>

Mouse control is offered on 16-bit versions. Your armour must be kept functional by collecting top-ups, and there are weapon power-ups such as machine guns and rocket launchers to be had.

		<desc>Prehistorik is a side-view platform game with superficial similarity to Chuck Rock, although the games were developed simultaneously in different countries. You control a neanderthal who must march through hostile pre-historic environments seeking food and keeping himself safe. Some food can be found in caves, but it mainly exists in living animal forms.

These include fire-breathing Pyro-Tax dragons, the Turtosaurus, and the Bad Bat. Each of these must be clubbed to death, some taking up to 5 hits, and then walked over. Some other enemies are indestructible, with the monkeys who throw coconuts at you particularly fiendish.

You will have to complete the level within the time limit, and avoid contact with these foes. However, bombs and improved weapons can be collected, as can extra lives, time bonuses and an improved jump.</desc>

		<desc>Six film reels have been stolen from your film studios by a rival company. In this platform game, your mission is to rescue from within the sets and backstage rooms they have been hidden in. Backstage sections are entered through doors, and weapons can often be collected in these.

The sets are themed around six different genres of film, and the backdrops, weapons and enemies fit these sections. There is a slapstick comedy played out in black and white (complete with greyscale background) a cartoon  with lots of Road Runnering and goofy facial expressions, a Wild West romp, Sci-Fi complete with aliens, and so on. After each platform level you will have to pass through a film scene - piloting a runaway mine-cart, navigating a scrolling shoot 'em up level, or similar.</desc>

		<desc>This football management game featured all five national English leagues. You started off managing one of the teams in the Conference, and had to try to reach the Premier league and win European competitions, either by improving your current club or by doing well enough to earn job offers elsewhere.

For each match you had to select the team, and choose a formation and a set of match tactics - intensity of tackling, height and length of passes, and shooting range could all be varied. In total there were almost 500 permutations of these options, as well as 18 basic formations.

You could sign players from other clubs, which involved making a financial offer to both club and payer and hoping that no other club offered more. Players who's contracts had expired could be signed for no club fee - so make sure all your players are under contract.

You also had to negotiate sponsorship deals, plan ground improvements, ensure that injured players got the right treatment, set up training schedules, and hire backroom staff (such as coaches and scouts).</desc>

		<desc>In the Premier Manager series you lead a team from the Conference, the fifth division of English football, into the Premier League and onto European glory. Sign the right players and sell the bad ones to improve your squad. As in previous games in the series, the telephone puts you in touch with your staff, such as coaches to improve your players' skills and a scout to find new players. Stadium improvements (room for more supporters, undersoil heating, a better supporters' club) and sponsorship (assigning a brand to each piece of the stands around and above the pitch) are largely unchanged from PM2.

New to this version is the Assistant Manager - if you can sign a quality one, he can do jobs such as training for you. Tactical depth is increased in PM3 - each player can be assigned a position on the pitch depending on which sector the ball is in, in a manner similar to Sensible World of Soccer. Match coverage is fuller than in earlier versions, with an isometrically-viewed pitch displaying each touch in detail, helping you work our why your team lost 5-0, and how to stop it happening again.</desc>

		<desc>The first game in Gremlin's series of football management games. You start off managing a team in the Conference (the fifth tier of English football) and aim to progress up the leagues, either by improving your existing team or earning jobs at better clubs elsewhere.

The features at your disposal include selecting training regimes, planning tactics for each match based on your opposition's strengths and weaknesses, scouting for new players including youth prospects, and arranging sponsorship and stadium improvements (so as to attract more fans).

The transfer system is a crucial part of the game, as you aim to sign players (who are broadly rated in each of the main skill areas) up against other teams who want them, and sell off players you don't need. You have an overdraft available, but make sure not to exceed it.

The game supports up to 4 players, whose matches all take place at the same time. You can make tactical changes and substitutions mid-match.</desc>

		<path>./PrimalRage_v1.1_AGA.lha</path>
		<name>Primal Rage</name>
		<desc>Primal Rage is a versus fighting game developed and released by Atari Games to arcades in 1994. The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic version of Earth called "Urth". Players control one of seven large beasts that battle each other to determine the fate of the planet. Matches feature many of the conventions of fighting games from the era, including special moves and gory finishing maneuvers.

Various ports were released for home consoles and personal computers. Efforts to perfectly emulate the arcade original have been unsuccessful due to an unusual copy protection method that the developers used.

Toys, comics, a novel and other merchandise tie-ins were produced.

A massive meteor strike has devastated the planet Earth. Human civilization comes to an end in the ensuing cataclysms, and humanity regressed into tribes of Stone Age dwellers. Primordial rainforest covers the land, and the continental landmass has shifted into the shape of a fire-breathing dinosaur skull. The planet is now primitively referred to as "Urth" by the survivors of the cataclysms.

Seven fearsome creatures emerge from their slumber deep within the Urth's crust, and become worshiped as gods by the humans, who form segregated clans beneath the ones they follow. The beasts themselves are divided between those who wish to keep peace on Urth, and those who attempt to plunge the world into further chaos for their own benefit. These creatures have otherworldly or supernatural abilities. The Primal Rage trading cards that were distributed along with the toyline presented each creature as a god of an aspect of nature, as in life and death, fire and ice. There are four of the good Virtuous gods and three evil Destructive gods. The character Sauron, god of Hunger, is marked as a "Virtuous Beast" despite the fact that his in-game ending displays an image of him devouring humans.

Primal Rage is a traditional two-dimensional fighting game in which two players select characters to battle each other in one-on-one combat, or a single player finishes a campaign of fights against the CPU, over increasing difficulty. The final battle of the single-player game consisted of fighting all the other CPU monsters with an increased power bar, made available in a mini-game prior to the fight. A total of seven characters are available for players to select from. Each character has his or her own specialized set of three attack moves and abilities. In the game, the object is to deplete the opposing character</desc>

The full championship includes 12 races against a field of seven riders (computer opponents are loosely named after real riders of the day – Rain Wayney and Lucie Kavanora for example). 

Circuits are set around the world, with various weather effects, with a rendition of each national anthem played on the pre-race screen. Handling is loose and arcadey. It is not possible to fall off – contact with hazards or other bikes simply results in you losing time.</desc>

Try to escape from the dungeon, take out Jaffar's guards, find your way through the Sultan's palace and defeat Jaffar himself. Now go, you've got 60 minutes!

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.

The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro and an altered set of graphics but the level layout remains almost identical to that of the original.</desc>

		<desc>In this early medieval real-time strategy war-game, two feuding princes on a small island have it out for each other. The king is dead and his successor must be determined through elimination, 'The Code of Steel'.

At the start of the game you decide upon the size of your army and the island on which the conflict takes place and the objective is to kill the other prince before his army gets yours. Once the setup is over and done with, the armies are put down on the island and the conflict begins. The units can be commandeered at three different levels of granularity, from the prince's banner down to the company, showing each individual soldier. Commands are issued by selecting the company or commander and issuing one of a set number of options to the unit. Once the armies meet they will battle it out until one of the princes is killed, terrain and conditions will affect the outcome of any conflict.

Two player games can be played via a null modem cable on two different computers.</desc>

These give off blue power-up tokens, which are used towards selecting one of many weapons. There are 4 front-firing options (guns, plasma, magma and laser-beams - guns can be built up quickly but lack top-end power compared to the others) as well as speed-up (only requires one token), side-shot, up to 3 homing missiles, build (a quick super-destructive blast that only functions when you aren't using auto-fire) and stealth (a period of invulnerability).

Each level has a very different setting, and an end-of-level boss to defeat. The chance to resume from the level you died at is offered up to level 3.

Unusually, the game has an option to emulate an auto-fire function using software (this makes it one of the few Amiga shoot 'em ups you can hope to get as far through on an emulator on keyboard as on joystick on the real thing).</desc>

		<name>Projectyle</name>
		<desc>Projectyle is a single or multiplayer (1 to 3 players) hockey-type sports game of the future. It features smooth-scrolling, frantic action, colorful graphics and digital music.

A total of five goal rooms, arranged in the shape of a cross, are connected with tunnels. The camera smoothly follows the puck/ball (the "projectyle") and scrolls to the adjacent rooms when entering one of the connecting tunnels. Each player, whether computer-controlled or not, has a room in which his own goal is located (their "defense" zone.) A fourth room -- the Frantic Zone -- contains a goalmouth for each player, while the central room, where action begins, allows access to the four other rooms.

The object of the game is for each player to protect their own goal while trying to bring the puck/ball into the other players' rooms to score a goal. Bonuses appear randomly in the rooms, allowing the player who passes on them to gain some benefits, such as freezing the other players for a few seconds, gaining extra stamina, or sealing exits.

The game supports up to 3 player simultaneous quick action single game play, and can support up to 8 players in leagues of varying lengths.  League/tournament play supports player/team management, including training, injuries and position reassignment.</desc>

A land full of good and evil, within which you must become Brian, The Viking Child, whose heroics have been foretold by the prophets and recorded in the oracle of the gods. But there's trouble in the land that you live in... Your family and friends are being held on the astral plane, imprisoned by the forces of darkness in an effort to foil the prophecy and install chaos throughout the land...

As Brian, your adventure in Prophecy 1 - The Viking Child will take you through many beautiful, but dangerous places, where you'll encounter great adversaries. Amongst these will be the eight apprentices of evil, slaves to the Dark Lord Loki, who will force you to fight or question your purpose under threat of punishment or penalty. Friendly shopkeepers will sell you items of worth, that will aid you on your quest. There are sixteen levels, each with its own backgrounds, enemies, and items. There are even puzzle elements similar to Bitmap Brothers' classic Gods. Overall, a great platform/puzzle hybrid that should please all fans of the genre, not least because of the long levels you'll have to make your way through. Recommended!</desc>

		<name>Pro PowerBoat Simulator</name>
		<desc>If this 'simulator' is to be believed, powerboat racing is a chaotic race across a number of largely one-directional tracks with fjords and inlets forcing you down one of two lanes, and sections where a bridge needs to be cleared by hitting a ramp at the right speed beforehand (as you jump over these, you can land so as to skim off other boats). Your boat is fitted with bombs, which can be placed so as to force the other boats to run over them, gaining you points. Extra bombs and fuel litter the course, often close to the banks, which you must avoid contact with, for fear of crashing your boat. When this happens you are forced into the next one, which is, as if by magic, available at a convenient point just beforehand. A helicopter flies overhead, dropping bombs which you must avoid, and often obscuring your view. The other boats often crowd together attempting to force you into the wall.

As with all the Codemasters budget titles, realism goes out of the window, with an emphasis on simple instantaneous action.</desc>

		<name>ProSoccer 2190</name>
		<desc>ProSoccer 2190 is set in the future in which soccer tournaments are mix between real-life outdoor and indoor soccer. The most important difference to outdoor soccer is that there is no out because the ball bounces back from the indoor walls. The three other changes are the different match division (four quarters  15 minutes), a time-out system and that the athletes wear American Football helmets.

The player takes control of one of 16 fictional teams and, depending on the team's origin, participates in either the American or European league. The winners of each league fight for the championship. During the matches, the player either controls the athlete with the ball when in offense or switches between athletes when in defense. When starting a shot, the game switches to "kick mode" in which the player needs to position the cursor in a box. Depending on the position, this changes the power, swerve and elevation of the shot.

The player also has a few management jobs to take care of, mostly player transfers between seasons and choosing the lineup for the next match. Every athlete has a set of statistics which influence his performance during matches, e.g. the result of duels. After calling a time-out, the player can make a substitution or change the tactical system.</desc>

		<name>Psyborg</name>
		<desc>You are a psyborg named Duncan Norton, who must travel through the vortex from a space vessel trapped in a galaxy very far from Earth. An alien race is threatening to take over 38 planets and you've got to stop them. 

Starting from Anacreon, you will mentally pass through the Krypton, Kalgan, Zorgon, Terminus, Trantor, and finally Sol systems. Each stellar system has a certain number of planets, which you will traverse from one to another. 

The game is a first-person virtual reality race, where you run as fast as possible on the tiles that are formed in a pentagonal prism. At the starting point you accelerate, and then change the facets of the prism in order to avoid falling through the gaps. When the tile's path  spirals, you may decelerate your velocity. Time runs out, and you must refill your time meter by standing on tiles marked with a "T". Standing on certain tiles that are marked with shapes of different blinking colors will give you a different amount of points. Special actions, such as jumping from one part of prism to another as well as teleporting forward and back, may be performed. Save points are placed on the track but the number of prism facets may change during your run.

Finishing the race to each planet will give you a password, which may be used later to start from this point. The best scores will be written in High Scores table.

The game is available for 1 or 2 players.</desc>

		<name>Pub Trivia Simulator</name>
		<desc>Pub Trivia Simulator is a game that attempts to simulate an Arcade Quiz Machine found in public houses. The idea is to move up a pyramid answering questions on various subjects to reach the top so you can attempt another pyramid but for money. Before you start the game you can select how many players (1-4), which question block to load (1-3) and which avatar for your player.

The game costs 10p and you select a square on the bottom row of the pyramid with various categories. When you have selected your question you then move to a new screen and press the start button. The question appears with the choice of three answers and you must answer before a timer reaches zero and if you get it correct you receive points and move back to the pyramid screen. You pick a new question on a new row and one that is touching the square you last answered. If you get it wrong and you are on the bottom row of the first pyramid you can try again but get it wrong at any other time and it is game over. The next player if selected now plays and if you have any money then you can play again after the other players turns.

If you reach the top of the pyramid and answer the question correctly then you move to the money maze. This is another pyramid similar to the first one but now has money hidden on certain squares. If you answer a question correctly with money then it is added to the bank and allows you to carry on if you get any questions wrong. Once all players have finished then the points collected during the game goes towards a high score.</desc>

Puffy's Saga is an overhead view maze game that represents a cutesy variant of Gauntlet. Each of the 20 levels has a quota of dots to eat before the level is completed. These levels are inhabited by foes who surround you and reduce your energy on contact. Meat restores 100 energy points each time - this total can go beyond its starting level of 500. You are armed with a gun, which not only kills foes but also turns many of them into edible energy-giving snacks.

Keys must be collected and used to open doors. Magic Goms allow you to use a map or a fire-bolt. Other available bonuses include invincibility periods and teleporting.</desc>

To do this, you will need to make your way from the start to the exit of numerous levels which take place in a variety of environments. Throughout each level are a variety of objects which you can pick up; on many of the levels you will need to figure out how to use the objects available to you in order to reach the exit. Some objects can used (like a gun or keys), and objects may be thrown, moved around and stacked. Of course, each level will also have a variety of bad guys wandering about which will cost Puggsy one of his lives if he's caught.

		<path>./PushOver_v1.23_1267.lha</path>
		<name>Push-Over</name>
		<desc>You're playing a small ant that is willing to help a friend in rather inconvenient situation. Apparently, your friend, doggie, likes to eat cookies that has his picture on their box, and he got himself so carried away that he lost the balance, and a bag of cookies fell deep down into an ant-hill. Now, you're goin' in, in a mission of solving puzzles, and retrieving the cookies for your friend.

Now, this ant-hill is a bit different from the ones you saw, and especially from the one you live in. It's path is filled up with boulders, and all the gates, and you must travel the quest to find the cookies. After each different place inside, you'll fins a small bag of cookie, and bring it back to your friend doggie.

The main quest consists of you carrying your-size boulders, and placing them in a well imagined line, so when you push the exact one, all must fall, and the one that marks the end must fall the last, or the door will stay shut permanently. Beside we know that ants are very easy, and can live almost every fall, you cannot practice that, so if you jusp from a little bit too high position, don't expect much, but to retry the level.

Every block, or boulder in a game has a different markings. Like for example, the yellow ones are bricks you can push, and they will just as easily fall, and push, or not, the brick in front of it. The red ones will do the opposite, you cannot push them, and if the yellow, or any other brick hits it, it'll continue falling back to the other side. Some bricks explode when you push them, or other brick hits them, and that way they leave the hole, so your brick can continue spining, or yet again, not. Some spin without stop, 'til they hit some other brick that can fall, some replaces the spaces, like building a bridge on that place, some go high and when hit the top, they stick to it, and push, or not, the brick in front of them. Anyway, that's the game basics.

Each level gives you the new code/password, so you can continue from the position where you ended each time you type that code. Perspective of your ant is like in any other platform game, and you control it with arrow keys, or joystick. But beware, the time is clicking, so you'll have to solve each level in a hurry.</desc>

		<name>Putty</name>
		<desc>In Putty, the player controls a blue blob with eyes. Putty has many moves that he could use to attack enemies or to navigate around the level. These abilities include being able to stretch out upwards, downwards, left and right to access far-off ledges. He also has the ability to inflate. This allows him to provide a cushioned landing for any falling bots. Over-inflation also acts as a "smart bomb", with Putty bursting, killing all of the enemies on the screen, whilst reducing his health in the process.

Putty is able to form part of himself into a fist, allowing him to punch left or right to dispatch enemies.

Putty is also able to melt into the floor, making him invulnerable and also allowing him to absorb enemies, recovering a small amount of health in the process. With certain enemies in the game, such as the clockwork orange, once Putty has absorbed one he is then able to morph into the enemy's shape to use its abilities.

A final ability of Putty's is being able to create a mug of coffee from part of himself, which will distract bots and make them stand still.

The levels in Putty are laid out vertically, with the screen scrolling up and down. The levels contain regular platforms, as well as "solid" ledges that Putty can not move through, and other special tiles including electric platforms and bounce pads.

The aim of each level is to rescue a set number of bots within the time limit. In the early sections of the game, the bots simply stand around the level. Putty has to absorb them, and carry them to the level's goal (either a flying saucer or an elevator). Later on in the game, the bots will jump around platforms, often falling to their death.

Invariably each level also contains various enemies. These enemies include Terminator carrots, Scouse sausages and sword-wielding spacemen. The enemies will attempt to hurt Putty in various ways. The attacks from some of the enemies will also hurt any bots that Putty is carrying at the time. If a bot is hurt four times it is killed, causing the player to have to find another bot to absorb.

Putty is also able to use powerups that are scattered around each level. These range from simple points bonuses to temporary invulnerability, to Uncle Ted. Once this latter powerup is collected, a man with a Hammond Organ named Uncle Ted appears, and proceeds to play a tune, causing all of the enemies in the level to freeze.</desc>

		<path>./Puzznic_v1.3_0041.lha</path>
		<name>Puzznic</name>
		<desc>The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.

There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)

The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.</desc>

This crystal is at the top of a six-level pyramid which naturally has to be conquered first. Each level consists of a number of rooms which have to be solved in a linear order by activating a touchstone. So the player walks through the rooms in a top-down perspective while dodging the enemies - contact causes the life meter to go down and an empty bar results in losing a live. Picking up power ups rewards bonus points, health refreshments, extra lives or smart bombs.</desc>

		<desc>Q-bic is loosely based upon the arcade classic. Fuzzball (AKA Q*Bert) and has been written by Ronald Weeserik. Ronald's no stranger to writing classic games on the Amiga and a few of his smashes are Silkworm, SWIV and Rodland.

The idea is to guide a blobby little sprite around a three dimensional pyramid by hopping from square to square and lighting up all the cubes in the structure. It all sounds very simple, but Ronald has included some devious nasties to compete with your sprite. Bubbles roll down the pyramid from top to bottom, whilst other similarly-shaped creatures may roll down and move from side to side.

Amazingly, Weeserik has chosen to release Q-bic onto the bulletin board circuit, and is not hoping to make any money out of the venture. Game is released as a Coverdisk on CU Amiga disk 41.</desc>

Drawing the rectangles using the "slow" method awards you the most points. Once a rectangle has been made, it will be colored in to show that you have claimed your territory. While drawing the rectangles, you need to watch out for Qix (pronounced "kicks"), a series of colored lines that crawl the screen. In addition to Qix, you also need to avoid the Sparks who travel around the border, as well as any lines that you have made, as well as The Fuse, who travels along the line that you are drawing.

		<name>Quadrel</name>
		<desc>Quadrel is a puzzle game in which you must fill each piece of the selected layout with different colored paints, without painting two adjacent pieces the same color.

At the beginning of a game, you can select the desired image or layout, as well as whether you wish to play with unlimited time or not. You can also select the "Imposed" game mode, in which the game points which piece you must fill next. Each layout has a set amount of paint available for use, in four different colors: red, green, blue and yellow. The amount of brush stokes left for each color is indicated on your palette. Some layouts have a large amount of a particular color and a very small amount of another, while other layouts have a more even amount of each color. The goal is to plan well from the start, so as to avoid running out of a particular color that will be needed to finish the layout.

The game can be played in solitaire mode, against the computer, or against another human player on the same screen. There are no sound effects during gameplay, only music. If you manage to finish a layout, you can enter your name in a high score table.</desc>

		<desc>Quartz is a shoot 'em up with a variety of sections. The first section (and every odd-numbered one) is viewed from above and scrolls in every direction. As well as standard attack waves, there are large red/blue/yellow balls which split on impact a lá Asteroids, and once the smallest ones are destroyed they release tokens. Once you have collected 9 of each, you can choose a power-up form a range including various weapons, restart points (which effectively gives infinite continues when used with an emulator's 'snapshot' feature) and repairs to the ship. Destroying the whole of standard waves gives combined tokens which add one to each of the three colours.

The even-numbered waves scroll in a single direction, but include waves coming at you from other directions, even from within the screen in 3D. You can have up to 3 power-ups stored on your ship at a time, and choose one to activate by pressing F1-F3 - they all have limited firepower.

		<name>Quest for Glory II : Trial by Fire</name>
		<desc>Quest for Glory II takes place in the fictional land of Shapeir, in the world of Gloriana. Directly following from the events of the first game, the newly-proclaimed Hero of Spielburg travels by flying carpet with his friends Abdulla Doo, Shameen and Shema to the desert city of Shapeir. The city is threatened by magical elementals, while the Emir Arus al-Din of Shapier's sister city Raseir is missing and his city fallen under tyranny.

After defeating the four elementals that threaten Shapeir, the Hero travels to the city of Raseir. There, he is imprisoned by Khaveen and under hypnosis helps the evil tyrannous wizard Ad Avis to resurrect the evil genie Iblis. In the final fight, the Hero attacks the palace and battles with Ad Avis, who falls to his presumed death begging for assistance from his Dark Master. As thanks for the Hero's success in liberating Raseir and restoring its lost splendor, the Sultan of Shapeir, Harun al-Rashid, rewards the Hero by adopting him as his son.</desc>

		<desc>Quest for Glory I: So You Want to Be a Hero (also known as Quest for Glory: So you Want to Be a Hero or Quest for Glory I Original: So You Want To Be A Hero and Quest For Glory I - Original) is the first game of the Quest for Glory Series, an adventure game/role-playing game hybrid, designed by Lori Ann Cole and published by Sierra On-line. It was originally known as Hero's Quest: So You Want To Be A Hero. The game was rereleased as Quest for Glory because of trademark issues involving the HeroQuest boardgame by Milton Bradley. Hero's Quest I/Quest for Glory I has been credited for being a genre-inventing game, as no other game before it had tried to mix adventure gaming with role-playing-like elements such as statistic building (strength, intelligence, health) that would actually have an impact on the ability to accomplish certain parts of the game.</desc>

Pressing the fire button makes Lord Agravain thrust his sword forward. Pressing fire while holding down makes him throw a weapon (the default one is a small lance). Like in Ghosts 'N Goblins, when the knight is hit he loses his armor. If he is attacked while semi-nude, he dies. There are several power-ups scattered throughout the 4 sets of levels (a cross paralyzes the enemies, a star gives invulnerability, etc). The game starts with three lives and has no form of saving progress.</desc>

You start out as a lowly peasant with only a few gold coins in your pocket and a bad attitude to defend yourself. By stumbling around the countryside and fighting hordes of creatures, you gain wealth, experience, and title.

Questron II spans two continents, Landor and the Realm of Sorcerers. Additionally, there are the requisite tombs, castles, and dungeons. In the first Questron, your goal was to defeat the evil Wizard Mantor. Now, in Questron II, the good Wizard Mesron has sent you back in time before the Book of Magic was created. Your goal is to defeat the six Mad Sorcerers before they can create the book.</desc>

Each room of the house is viewed isometrically, and contains all the features you would expect to find in a large house, from cookers and telephones to pool tables and paintings. Each one can be picked up, pushed, pulled and used, with the diamonds located in intricate and surprising places.

Due to Mr. Croucher's keen interest in experimental science, there are also monsters moving through the rooms. Contact with these reduces some of the energy on one of your 3 lives.</desc>

		<name>Raider</name>
		<desc>The fact is that Raider is that old 64 budget classic Thrust with a bit more colour and a few more levels. After plunging into the game, it's made clear that you have to shoot out all the fortifications and pick up a cog-like pod on each of the four star systems and then fly through a powerplant to deposit them. This boils down to a great deal of fiddly frustration as you try to negotiate flak and rock outcrops whilst battling with gravitational pull from the planet.

Thrust Raider is controlled from the keyboard, something of an anachronism in this day and age for a game methinks, especially when the mouse could have done the job equally well. The sound effects do not help, whilst the graphics look, as someone put it 'as if they were knocked up on D Paint in ten minutes'. It's not that Raider has no appeal, the original gameplay can still hold your attention for a while, and it's fiendishly difficult too.</desc>

		<desc>With $100000 in the bank after taking out loans and selling stocks, it's time to start a railroad! Choose from 4 scenarios across two continents with randomly generated resources, and design your own railroad that moves people and goods across the country. Use the revenue to continue expanding, while keeping control of your company and appeasing your stock holders with growth and revenues. Play the stock market with company assets. Drive your competitors out of business with buyouts and rate wars. Multiple types of resources to carry (roughly grouped as slow freight, fast freight, passengers, mail) and convert, own facilities to maximize profit (buy a steel mill and the conversion from iron ore to steel makes money for YOU). Use the latest available technology to your advantage (new locomotives). Your objective is to retire with a huge bonus (based on your company's assets) and become the President or the Prime Minister (depending on which continent). 

The game is essentially a bird's-eye-view real-time strategy game with aspects of building and stock market manipulation. Each fiscal period is 2-years, which corresponds to 1-day of track time. Build different sizes of stations to take care of different local needs, create trains that switch consists at different stations and maximize throughput. Upgrade/retire/modify trains as times change. The faster the trains arrive, the more money they earn. Multiple options will keep you busy as each game is different.</desc>

Computer cars have varying personalities and abilities. You must finish in the top 3 to move on to the next race.

The opportunity to upgrade your car comes after each race, with the points you earn from race results (4,2,1 for the top 3). There are six categories of upgrades - turbo, steering, traction, aerodynamics, repair time and brakes.</desc>

Colonel Trautman has been kidnapped by the Soviets, and you've gone in there to rescuing him. Doing so is a three-part operation approximately following the plot of the film.

In the first part, you explore the building Trautman could be in, through a top-down view of the building. It is heavily protected by infra-red security beams, which when activated unleadsh the enemies. The locations of the beams are only apparent if you collect the special goggles. Other hazards include mines, trapdoors and booby-trapped doors, but there are enhanced weapons to collect.

Section two is identical to the first, except that it is located outside, the enemy are onto you from the start, and there are no traps. The final section changes to an Operation Wolf-style shoot 'em up, with a horde of tanks, foot soldiers and helicopters to face. Your gun can jam, which adds to the challenge of finally getting out alive.</desc>

		<desc>Your House has been overrun by rats. You must herd the rats into trap machines to clear them out. In order to do so, you must manipulate the environment to set up pathways so that the rats are headed in the right direction. Objects that you move around include blocks, fans, and pipe pieces. Rat-Trap on the Commodore Amiga, it was developed by Fox Williams for the British software house Audiogenic, who licensed it to Acclaim Entertainment, the U.S.-based publishers of a range of games based on The Simpsons.</desc>

		<desc>R.B.I. Baseball 2 features all 26 major league teams, each with a full roster of players. You can choose any National or American League team. You can even play one of the 1989 All-Star squads.

R.B.I. Baseball 2 has One Player and Two Player options as well as a Password mode to enable you to play a full season (one game against every team in the division). In addition, a watch mode provides you with the best seat in the house for a computer-controlled match up.

R.B.I. Baseball 2 is similar to the original R.B.I. Baseball in terms of gameplay. This time around the game uses the teams and statistics from the 1989 season. Just as in the original, you get to see what it's like to step up to the plate as Ricky Henderson, pitch the ball like Nolan Ryan, and catch a line drive like Ozzie Smith.</desc>

		<desc>After the success of the Ghostbusters film (and indeed of the licensed game from Activision) a cartoon TV series was created, which this converted Data East arcade game is based on. You control a Ghostbuster, who has 10 levels full of ghosts to clear up.

This is done by first shooting the ghosts using a gun, and then by using a photon beam (by holding down the fire button) to suck them in for storage in the backpack. Photon recharges can be collected, as can the potential for an improved shot, as well as a shield. The Ghostbusters mascot Slimer also appears as a power-up, which hovers around your character killing ghosts on contact.</desc>

		<name>Realms of Arkania - Blade of Destiny</name>
		<desc>The first game in the Realms of Arkania trilogy was the Blade of Destiny. It combines all the best characteristics of that times RPG's, like an extensive story line, first person view mode, cave exploring, scenery and freedom over your own actions. This game was an immediate hit when it was first released, forcing the producers to make a new English version almost over night! This delayed the sequel to the game, Star Trail, for a whole year.



The game is incredibly huge for the time it was made. A lot of work was put into creating the world, including history, geography, folklore, races and NPC's. The story is epic, as all RPG's... You play the role of six different people; all looking for adventure and fame that arrives in the city of Thorwal. After a while, you are sent to the real quest of the game: hunt for the sword of legendary warlord Hetman Hyggelik. In order to find it, you will have to travel the world in search for pieces of a map, drawn by one of Hyggelik's warriors. This map, naturally, shows the location of the sword.



The game is good, and a nice way to start off the trilogy. Have fun!</desc>

In each of the game's single screen levels the player's task is to save a number of humans that have been captured by robots. The player enters each level from a drop ship and has to rescue the humans by simple moving up to them and touching them and then leading them back to the drop ship. At the same time numerous robots have to be destroyed but while doing so it's important to avoid killing the humans by mistake.

Each level has its own quota of humans that have to be saved and it has to be done within a time limit. There are numerous different robots with differences in pace, armour and weapons. Some power ups can be picked up such as shields, extra lives, invisibility and various new weaponry like rockets. At some locations there are fences that have to be destroyed and doors that have to be unlocked. There are also trap doors that have to be avoided.</desc>

		<path>./RedHeat_v1.2_0565.lha</path>
		<name>Red Heat</name>
		<desc>Red Heat is based on the Walter Hill film of the same name, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Belushi. You take control of Soviet detective Ivan Danko (played by Schwarzenegger), who travels to Chicago in pursuit of the fearsome Georgian drug lord Victor Rosta. 

The game is essentially a side-scrolling beat'em up in the vein of Vigilante. As Danko, you proceed across four levels which follow the movie's original setting, where you are constantly attacked by members of the Cleanheads, a group of drug-dealers who are in business with Victor Rosta. To eliminate hostiles you can either punch them (slow but long-ranged) or head-butt them (close-ranged but faster). The only defensive move available is crouching, so as to avoid being hit - there is no jumping or any other evasive tactics. Occasionally, you can get hold of a handgun and fire six shots at the villains. Other items you can pick up will boost your health, grant you access to bonus levels, or cause you to lose control of Danko for a few seconds.

One peculiarity of Red Heat is its widescreen-like game area, and the fact that all characters are drawn from the waist up. This may find partial explanation in the first level, set in a Russian sauna where, as in the original movie scene, all characters are not wearing clothes.</desc>

And the only way NATO can prevent that from happening is to reinforce their forces with convoys from the US and other countries. 

You are in command of one of the US attack submarines. You must hold the ocean against the Soviet navy at all costs, or the land battle will go badly. Part submarine simulator, part dynamic campaign, and part WW3 simulation, Red Storm Rising is an amazing look at modern warfare.</desc>

Leia and Luke are a bit cut off in the forests of Endor - sounds painful - and have to run the gauntlet of stormtroopers on Speederbikes. The whole bit is like Spy Hunter with a Zaxxon perspective, plus added trees and Ewok traps. The second bit has Lando Calrissian piloting the Millennium Falcon down the reactor tube of the Death Star. Using the same perspective as the forest bit, it is basically a question of avoiding the sticky-out bits and the annoying little Tie fighter bits. Now you are Chewbacca at the controls of a scout walker, trying to run the gamut of logs and rocks on your way to the bunker. Moving logs can he shot, but the big piles of them have to be strolled around.

Every-thing is carried out the way you'd expect on an Amiga - sampled speech from the film, pretty graphics... switch off the brain and be prepared for some unsophisticated violent enjoyment. Return of the Jedi is grand while it lasts, but since it's a little superfish (as in superfishul, not as in halibut)  that may not be forever.</desc>

Of course every bit of help is appreciated and so every scientist is cloned 50 times for a better productivity. Unfortunately the evil Mechanauts have invaded and the player has the mission to save the scientists and drive the Mechanauts off.

This game is a side-scrolling shooter in which the player's main task is to shoot everything in sight - except the scientists of course, which should be picked up. They also can be shot to win the level, but then the player misses out on extra weapons: every scientist (along with his/her clones) has his own piece of equipment which can be activated at any time as long as the scientist is on board. In contrast to many other games of the genre, contact with the environment does no harm but causes the ship to reverse the flying direction at full speed. All in all there are 50 levels with twelve scientists each.</desc>

		<name>Reunion</name>
		<desc>In the 27th century, centuries have peace have allowed great scientific progress in the development of the first interstellar warp drive. Two research ships, designated Explorer-1 and Explorer-2, are outfitted with experimental drive and sent to find new planets of colonization. Only Explorer-2 returns back to Earth. Refiited as a colony vessel, Explorer-2 is once again ready to embark when peace is disrupted. At this same time, a planet-wide rebellion stages a coup and overthrows the government. The Explorer-2, crewed by a loyalist space crew barely escapes and leaves the solar system. Years later, the Explorer-2 arrives damaged at it's destination and a colony is set up, naming it New Earth. After many generations, the colony is self-sufficient enough to develop a mission: Explore nearby space, research new technologies, harvest resources, develop a space fleet and eventually... reconquer and reunify with the Earth.

Reunion is a strategy game where players must manage the resources and development of a colony. From a central command area, players select from among different menus to control different aspects of the colony. Many of these menus also need the appropriate personnel in charge (commanders), whose skills and price tag vary. Typical menus include: The research screen where specific areas are selected, the production/buy menu which turns resources into goods, the colony building menu where construction can be scheduled and the colony's facilities managed, the galactic map where new planets are chosen for a closer look, and eventually colonization. Players can also consult with their commanders or go to "space local", the nearby bar for all the gossip. In order to produce new material, the player has six different minerals to mine and discover on various planets in the solar system.</desc>

		<name>Revelation!</name>
		<desc>Revelation is an abstract puzzle game based around cracking codes on safes. Each of the 80-plus levels is a top-down view of an arrangement of locks and dials, which must be aligned so as to unlock each section by having identical colors touching each other. Not all locks can be moved however, and all of this must be done within a time-limit. Your time to collect the gold (by opening each of the 9 doors in sequence in the hope of finding lots of bling) is limited by how long you took to crack the code. There is a bonus game to unlock, as well as extra lives and special power-ups. A password system ensures that a level need only be cleared once.</desc>

The camel is teamed up with a bipedal goat, who can be controlled either by the computer or by a second player. If the camel crouches down, the goat can mount it and ride on its back, enabling them to focus their firepower.</desc>

		<desc>This typically zany Jeff Minter  title sets you as a mutated camel, with an optional support one mimicking your moves elsewhere. The hordes of enemies to be taken on include falling umbrellas and drinks machines. Shot enemies release tokens ranging from points bonuses and energy recharges to control-reversers and poison.

Speaking of controls, the game uses the same system as Llamatron, which means that you fire automatically in the direction you're moving, but pressing the fire button allows you to rotate the direction of fire while immobile. This allows enemies in different parts of the screen to be attacked from less precarious positions.</desc>

		<desc>You play Rick Dangerous, an Indiana Jones type who's on a quest to find the lost Coolu Amazon tribe.  However, his plane crashes in the middle of a bunch of crazed Coolus. Hopefully he's up to the challenge of escaping. If he is, he will find himself in the pyramid of Egypt with no easy way past leaders and their minions, and then engulfed in a web of traps in a Nazi base.

Rick Dangerous is a platform game across over 100 screens, in which Rick has his gun in one hand, and dynamite sticks in another. You must take a methodical approach to clearing each screen, as there are traps in place which will need memorizing and preempting where possible. Use the dynamite wisely, for enemies you can't get into the purely-horizontal range of your gun.</desc>

There are a fair selection of punches and tactics. The punches themselves are hardly textbook affairs, nor are they aesthetically executed, but they do seem able to bruise your opponent.

Game has better than average graphics and well defined sprites, but a boxing simulation stands or falls on the flexibility of its play. Standing next to someone and thumping them can get very boring. Ringside is reduced to a fairly static and visually unexciting game. Not even the absurd sequence between rounds where you have to wave a towel over your boxer by fiercely woggling the joystick can alter this.

Ringside can be a good laugh either in the one player or in the two player mode. Then again, no-one gets their nose broken.</desc>

Unfortunately an evil sorceress, called Medusa, has taken control of the country and is now dominating the people.

Your task is to find five magical rings that will give you the power to overthrow the sorceress and claim back your heritage. In the beginning you'll try to earn money by doing trade between different towns or try your luck at bounty hunting or at treasure hunts. Once you've earned enough money to maintain a larger army, you'll send forth your men to search for the rings which are in the possession of large soldier of fortune armies rallying the lands.

Sometimes you'll take part in small arcade sequences like sword fighting, sea fights or control your army on the battle field.</desc>

		<name>Rise of the Dragon</name>
		<desc>The year is 2053, and Los Angeles has turned into a grim place ruled by crime and corruption. William 'Blade' Hunter is a private detective who once was a police officer. He is asked to investigate a horrible murder of the mayor's daughter, whose body was mutilated. As Hunter begins to search for clues that would help him solve the crime, he uncovers a conspiracy involving a deadly drug and a powerful criminal syndicate behind it.

Rise of the Dragon is a futuristic first-person adventure game. The game's visuals are reminiscent of a comic book, with digitized photos of actors and hand-painted backgrounds. Unlike most other adventure games of the time, it relies less on inventory puzzles and more on specific choices made by the player. The game has an internal clock and requires the player to plan the protagonist's moves ahead in order to be in the right place at the right time. Dialogues with multiple choices are utilized as a gameplay tool; a wrong choice will often lead to a premature end of the adventure.

There are two side-scrolling action sequences in the game; both can be bypassed without penalty if the player character dies several times in a row. The Sega CD version does not allow the player to skip these sequences. In addition, it uses a different color palette with a greenish tint, and has voice-overs for the dialogues.</desc>

The game scrolls sideways, and has sections where precision jumps are required, either to clear rivers or collect bonuses. You carry a dagger to deal with the enemies, and must avoid contact with them. When killed, they leave coins to be collected - these are spent in the shop sections. Death loses you most of your coins, but they can usually be retrieved if they land on solid ground - making it better to be killed in combat than by drowning.</desc>

Your vehicle is equipped with a machine gun to help you out, and occasionally a weapons plane will fly in and drop additional power ups that can be collected. Some of these are the U.Z. canon, cruise missiles, and speed boost. Your car has a very limited amount of fuel, however more can be picked up along the way by crossing the halfway point of a level, or by collecting the red and green fuel spheres that appear in the road or after destroying certain enemies.  On many levels collecting fuel is critical otherwise you won't be able to reach the finish line.</desc>

		<name>Road Rash</name>
		<desc>Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.

By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.

Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.</desc>

Though best played after Roadwar 2000 since it allows you to bring your old gang over from the first game, you can also design from scratch a new posse of armsmasters, bodyguards, doctors, and escorts. What's left of the European Union is as deadly as the United States in the first game. With all the roving villains, your party is as likely as not to be eliminated in the blink of an eye if you choose the quick combat resolution option. So if someone gives you trouble while you're looting the countryside for tires, choose Ã¢â‚¬Å“detailed combatÃ¢â‚¬Â and see if you have what it takes to be the Napoleon of road warriors.</desc>

Crucially, this involves shooting out the barriers at the side of the road (and avoiding falling into the gaps they create). You always play against another droid, who can be treated as friend or foe - pushing them into the gap at the side you've just created is a particularly neat trick, especially when playing a human opponent.

You are armed with a laser gun, which can be directed seperately from your main direction of motion. The roads include a range of hazards, including barriers and spikes, although bonus weaponry and a speed-up can be gained. Contact with these (or your opponent) will gradually drain your shields, and once these are gone you have little chance of surviving for long.</desc>

		<desc>The awkwardly-titled Robbeary gives you the opportunity of raiding a 24-floor mega-store of its fruity contents. The game opens with the obligatory irrelevant parallax starfield backing the title screen. A short entertaining sample borrowed from a Pet Shop Boys intro is looped continually until you start the game. If you have read between the lines of the scenario you will not be surprised to hear that Robbeary is a traditional platform game. It would seem that this store is an enormous greengrocer's shop, for almost every bit of floor space is occupied by big juicy pieces of fruit. Collect them all from the current screen to get to the next.

Beartle is a very neatly drawn sprite, as are all the enemies. Everything is large and very colourful, no doubt designed with a younger player in mind, the graphics certainly impress. Sound effects during the game are suitably jolly, though it is a shame the title piece never gets anywhere.

Robbeary is definitely one of the better platform games around the Amiga at the moment (1988), and if you have a younger player in mind it would be an ideal choice.</desc>

To chart the stars and planets explorers named "Robinsons" are sent on scouting tours of duty. Most of the time the Robinsons sent away are individuals deemed dangerous to society and whose ships are sabotaged.

You play one of these Robinsons who gets stranded on a mysterious alien planet on which a telepathic woman is also stranded. As it turns out she knows a way to get off the planet, but she needs your help to escape.

Gameplay consists of first person roleplaying with the emphasis placed on character modeling and survival. Take a dip when it's cold and you'll sure catch the flu, don't treat an infected injury and amputation is on the way, etc. You must fashion your own tools from whatever you can find on the planet and the game uses pre-rendered sprites over voxel technology terrain for graphics.</desc>

All three of the platform stages present RoboCop with a set goal: destroying the Nuke drug lab, apprehending the criminal Cain and finally destroying Cain in his "RoboCop 2" form. On the way to the goals, RoboCop must defeat swarms of henchmen who attack him with guns, mortars and bazookas, and in the last level, various robotic enemies like flying drones and ED-209s. He can shoot back with a standard gun as well as pick up weapon power-ups in the form of cola cans: three-way shot, scatter shot and rapid fire, each with limited but ample ammunition. Other cans enhance the time limit of the level, replenish life energy or provide a temporary shield. Not every power-up should be picked up, however: some have negative effects like reducing the time limit or reversing the controls.</desc>

		<desc>F29 Retaliator authors DID developed this particular use of the Robocop license, and produced something different from most film licenses. While it featured a succession of levels based around sections of the movie, these were highly varied and presented in polygon 3D graphics. These can be played in any order in the Arcade mode, or in planned sequence in the Movie Adventure mode, which follows the film's plot of Japanese investors wishing to replace Robocop with their Robot Ninja designs, and thus expecting him to prove himself as superior.

The first task is a car chase resembling Chase HQ, in which a mazey section of road must be followed efficiently. There are several first-person 3D shooing sections,. in which you must use a target to shoot down punks and invaders, without harming civilians. Robocop also takes to the skies in a simulation of his new Gyropack flying device. Also, he must do battle with his intended replacement in a fixed-perspective beat 'em up section.</desc>

The major corporation there, Omni Consumer Products (OCP) saw an opportunity to sell a new kind of law enforcement officer to the troubled city. They took what was left of Murphy, encased it in titanium armor, wiped his memory and created RoboCop. Now it's up to RoboCop to clean the streets of Detroit and eliminate the one responsible for his murder, Clarence Boddicker. But it looks like Clarence might not be the kingpin of this town...

Based on the 1987 movie of the same name, RoboCop allows the player to control RoboCop. The majority of the game is a side scroller. RoboCop can punch unarmed citizens and shoot armed citizens. He can move left, right and duck but can not jump. Different weapons can be picked up from enemies, and power-ups to restore health and/or energy. Following levels, RoboCop will have to match a criminal's face to the proper mugshot and engage in a first-person shooting bonus round.</desc>

		<desc>Robozone is a three-part arcade game, divided into a platform section, a 3D maze section and a horizontally-scrolling shoot-'em-up. Now there's nothing inherently wrong with the multiple-subgames style, but each of the three mini games is as thin and dull as the ones found here.

Everyone here has found the platform sequence tedious within 30 seconds, the middle game is simply atrocious, and the last section, a fairly presentable R-Typeish blaster, is unlikely to be reached by anyone other than the most bloody-minded, making it a bit of a waste of time.

The bottom line: excellent in-game music, but a tired, uneventful and repetitive game that more or less completely fails to provide any decent entertainment whatsoever after the neat front end sequence.</desc>

However, in the 21st Century time travel has been mastered, as have jet-propulsion backpacks, plus some cataclysmic weaponry and advanced code-breaking equipment. Thus, you are sent back in time to change the result of the war using this technology to find their five rocket factories and destroy the moon base.

The game fits the Cinemaware template closely, with a string of action sequences linked by cinematic animation sequences to set the scene. There's also a strategic element, as you move your spies around to gain information and avoid detection, and decide how much Lunarium to use at each stage of the game. Action sequences include hand-to-hand combat with a Nazi guard, and flying through the air shooting either hordes of enemy planes or the Zeppelin itself.</desc>

		<desc>You are Cecil Pitt, a wannabe rock star manager. You must choose from 1-4 rock stars (with names such as Tina Turnoff and Wacko Jacko) to manage by viewing their audition tapes. Once you chosen your artists you then have to choose what kind of gear to get them - spanking new, second hand or dodgy. The dodgy gear is dirt cheap but you might pay for your choice later on in the game.

To make your group a star, you have options such as practicing, publicity stunts, and buying gifts for your stars. Each action you choose advances the calendar by one day and you have until December to achieve your ultimate aim of superstardom - represented by a line graph which rises or falls depending on the performance of your band's releases.

Once your band has recorded their first album you can choose to release the single and/or the album. The single needs a video to go with it which costs varying amounts of cash depending on which director you choose. You can choose to go for publicity, but this can be risky as there is a chance that one of your rock stars will be in the papers as an ex-rock star who died in any of many strange ways (all that's missing is a 'bizarre gardening accident'). Publicity affects your sales directly and also affects the crowds who attend your gigs. You lose the game if either you run out of money, or all of your rock stars die.</desc>

		<desc>Taking a rather literal view of the term 'slap-stick humour', Rodland features two fairies called Tam and Rit, whose mission is to rescue their mum who's been captured and taken to a castle. 

There are 40 screens to clear, all full of baddies, who are disposed of by grabbing them with a stick, and flipping them from side to side to inflict damage. The hits needn't all be inflicted at the same time, as it's possible to release them to move them out of the way.

When killed, each bad guy releases some kind of extra, ranging from points bonuses to various devices which can be used to kill other enemies.

Each level also contains a certain amount of fruit. If you can collect all of this (with some bad guys still alive - you move on immediately once they're gone) you enter a bonus game, in which each enemy's death results in one of the letters E,X,T,R and A being released - collect them all for an invaluable extra life.

In the Game Boy version the difficulty lies slightly lower because the player can use his wand even when climbing ladders.</desc>

Just like the latter, Roketz is an excellent multiplayer game. The fast paced dogfights guaranteed high levels of adrenaline for countless hours. The game boasts very nice ray-traced graphics and a wide variety of weapons to choose from.

Each battleground has different obstacles: gun turrets, pulsating force fields, etc. And of course, gravitational force constantly drags you down, so you will need both precise piloting skills and reflexes to succeed. The locations are nicely varied, although most of the action takes place in old production facilities rather than open space. Overall, if you enjoy classics like Thrust or Gravity Force, Roketz is well worth your time.</desc>

That's your first mission, but it's a long way to Rome and in this game, you will see not all paths lead to Rome actually. Escape from that little town before the lava kills you and you will be saved... In the first mission, that is.

But actually, there's so much to say about this game, that I can only recommend playing it. Its graphics are very good for its time and the gameplay is pretty okay too. You have a lot of freedom to do whatever you like, but you are bound to some storyline restrictions, which makes this game fun and not too hard to play.

So it's definitely a game I would recommend, especially if you like to play freeplay adventure games. Anyway, try it and you will see for yourself.</desc>

		<path>./Rotor_v1.1.lha</path>
		<name>Rotor</name>
		<desc>You control a battle tank (the Rotor) which hovers in a 2D-labyrinth. Gravity pulls heavily on the Rotor, making it fall towards the ground. As any contact with walls or enemies is deadly, your main task is to avoid that. You may rotate your tank freely and accelerate via an afterburner, thus manoeuvring through the corridors -- imagine a mix of Asteroids and Lunar Lander to get an idea of the physics.

Scattered throughout the 18 different fortresses are boxes. Shoot these open to find either a) Fuel: this will replenish your supply, which is drained by shooting and accelerating. b) Sun crystals: Collect all to finish the mission. c) Bombs. They will explode in 30 to 60 seconds, destroying your ship. You can avoid that by leaving the screen quickly, or by picking the bomb up; this earns you major credits, but your ship drops much faster due to increased weight. d) Pearls. Collecting these advance the upgrade counter by one to three steps; you may activate the current upgrade at any time, which will improve your rotation speed, engine strength, weapon, shield etc. Boxes are emptied by carefully flying very, very close to them and activating a tractor field.

As if gravity and accurate flying wasn't challenging enough, the game also confronts you with various enemies. All of these are immobile and fire in a straight line; the sheer mass of them makes avoiding the bullets a difficult task nevertheless. Apart from turrets, there are attractors and repulsors who'll smash you into walls, and force fields that need to be deactivated by finding and shooting a switch.

The tricky labyrinths together with the short supply of fuel, weight constraints and clever upgrade system make Rotor more a game of tactics and accuracy than arcade action. Wild shooting and careless flying will deplete your fuel in no time; you'll have to progress carefully to discern traps in time.</desc>

		<desc>Rather tastelessly, the plot of this one concerns a catastrophic nuclear accident in Russia. You must trek through seven levels inhabited by mutated super-intelligent animals in order to diffuse each nuclear reactor.

Gameplay is a Gryzor style flip-screen run'n'gun shooter (with occasional jetpack flights), with fairly unrelenting action. Power-ups are issued by a canister which you'll have to control in order to gain the weapon you want. The difficulty level is pitched high, as with Project X which was released at a similar time.</desc>

		<desc>Due to an accident involving Professor Flipnoodles' Pocket Rocket (would you trust a scientist called Flipnoodles? I certainly wouldn't, especially as mad scientists cause so many computer game plot disasters) the Hanna Barbera characters have been hurtled into space. The Lilli-Punies have kidnapped them, and will only let them free if they can rescue their missing compatriots.

The search starts on the surface of the planet, but also takes Ruff underground into the cavernous regions the Lilli-Punies live in. These have lots of water, which Ruff must avoid. Plenty of extra lives can be collected along the way, with solving puzzles as important as good reactions and dexterity.</desc>

		<desc>A platform adventure played across 17 levels, starring one of the younger videogame characters you’ll see. The game scrolls in multiple directions, although you are mostly progressing vertically, with levels designed so that one slip can see you falling a long way – this is similar to Rainbow Islands, but the levels are considerably longer, and it happens right from level one, making it more significant. Hits with the bad guys cause your percentage of energy to deplete. Each level is time-limited, and you get continues as well as lives. There is an surveillance element to positioning, with characters often camouflaging themselves behind backgrounds, and it being possible to use hills to hide, and get to attack creatures that would otherwise be much tougher foes.</desc>

The game recreates the exact structure of the tournament, and includes all 16 teams. The gameplay has been simplified slightly, in the aim of creating a more flowing and less complicated game. As a result, scrums are frequent, penalties are absent, and a flowing running game is favoured. The teams are of different abilities, reflecting their real life skills.</desc>

		<name>RVF Honda</name>
		<desc>RVF Honda puts you on board a realistically-modeled RC30 bike, with the task of becoming world champion. Initially you race at Clubman level on fictitious local tracks (one of which is set in MicroProse's old UK home of Tetbury), before moving up to UK and then World championship racing if you're good enough.

Each class of racing has 8 computer opponents, with the top 7 finishers in each of the championship's 8 races scoring points, and the races can be set to 5,10, 15 or 20 laps. The game's graphics appear to feature sprite-based bikes atop polygon scenery, which makes for very fast gameplay. 

The circuits feature puddles of water to upset the bike's handling, and oil, which causes you to crash. It takes time to remount the bike and get back up to speed by revving it back up (more realistic than most motorbike games at the time, but frustrating as you suffer for mistakes more), and after a couple of crashes the bike's dashboard fails, making it much harder to ride competitively.

There is a two-player null-modem link-up mode, which can support an ST racing against an Amiga if you have the right cable.</desc>

Rygar is a side-scrolling platform game that sees you take control of a dead warrior who has risen from his grave to rid the land of Argool from the evil King Ligar. To achieve his objective, Rygar will have to navigate through various landscapes battling 22 different types of enemies using his long chain with a shield attached to the end of it.  Along the way, you will collect various power-ups that enhance your attacking capabilities and ramping up your points score to obtain valuable extra lives.</desc>

In this turn-based strategic simulation you must choose a team of four of these from the 8 available, and take them to victory in five increasingly tough missions. Even before you get into the main gameplay, there is a lot of strategy involved in choosing weaponry, as they make different amounts of noise when used (reducing the stealth potential) and their ammunition is of varying weight.

In each turn you have limited action points per soldier, which must be used for all movement, firing and reloading moves. The maps are viewed isometrically, with a compass used to indicate the directions of movement, and where the incoming fire emanated from.</desc>

		<name>Saint and Greavsie</name>
		<desc>Saint and Greavsie is a sports trivia game where one to four players have to answer sport-related questions. Players start by throwing a ball across a series of stadiums. To the left of these stadiums is a green bar, and the higher the green bar, the greater the distance the ball will go. 

Depending on where the ball lands, the player has to answer three types of questions from one of four question packs. Home questions (worth one point) are generally related to modern football and are the easiest to answer. Away questions (worth two points) are generally related to football in the 1960s and '70s with teasers about 'golden oldies'. Finally, derby questions (worth three points) will test your knowledge of football trivia, and these questions are fun as well as factual. Players can choose to answer the question or pass onto the next player. If the player chooses to answer a question correctly, a penalty shootout is given which involves the player kicking a goal to score bonus points.

The winner of the game is declared after all players have completed 21 or 42 matches (when one league season is completed). The winner is the player who has the most points.</desc>

Contact with the enemies en route (which are mostly mutant demons) drains your limited energy, and you are also working against a time limit on each section. As well as your magical powers (which are stronger in part two), you can collect swords to attack, as well as lightning bolts which can be collected to destroy all enemies on screen.

You play Savage, a muscular warrior who was imprisoned in a castle. When he broke free, he found out that his imprisonment had been a trick with the sole purpose of imprisoning his love, the maiden. You have to progress through the 3 parts of the game to rescue her. 

The first is a simple horizontal-scrolling shooter, in which you use the trajectory of your shots to kill enemies and collect the treasures and improved weapons they drop when killed. The second is a 1st person perspective 3D shooter resembling Space Harrier, with skulls to shoot and monoliths to avoid. In the third you play Savage's Eagle form, flying through platform-style levels avoiding timing-based hazards and shooting anyone who gets in your way.

		<name>Scrabble</name>
		<desc>Scrabble is a licensed version of the popular Spear's  game developed by U.S. Gold Ltd. 

Scrabble is a word game for 2 - 4 players. 
It is played by forming inter-locking words, cross-word style, on a Scrabble playing board. The Scrabble board is a grid on which there are bonus squares, playing a letter on one of these squares doubles or triples the score for either the letter or the entire word.
Players have seven letters, or tiles, each and at the end of each turn they take new letters from a pile, unseen, to replace the letters used. 

This game has the following features ;

1. multi-player game
 2, 3, or 4 players can play the game together. Players can be human or computer controlled.
2. sound effects and music
3. a practice mode
This mode of play enables the following features, 

1. no time limit,
4. a hint mode where the game shows the best move with the letters at the players disposal,
5. an advice feature which, after the player has taken their turn, shows how many higher scoring moves could have been made, 
6. the option to see what tiles remain unplayed,
7. a peek facility that allows the player to see other player's tiles
8. if an illegal word is played it will not be allowed but the player will not lose their turn,

a competition mode
In this mode each player has 25 minutes in which to play all of their game moves and for each minute over that limit the player is fined 10 points
The 'hint' and 'advice' features of the practice session are not available and the 'unused letters' option will show only the number of letters and not a full breakdown of the tiles remaining. If it is the players move ten the timer cannot be stopped, and the game cannot be saved and re-loaded.
Only game scores achieved in competition mode will be entered into the 'Top Scores' table.

This game is based on the Chambers English Dictionary and the Official Scrabble Words books current at the time of release</desc>

Your fighter plane is aged and under-powered, yet you must face down large planes, tanks and ground targets to achieve victory. Each level ends with a close-viewed section of particular intensity before finally facing a boss. Smart bombs are occasionally found lying around, and can destroy everything on the screen, although you can't use them on the bosses. A simultaneous 2-player mode is provided.</desc>

To solve the game the player has to explore the (shortened) town and solve a few basic puzzles which are partly not present in the full version of the game. He also needs to chat with several persons known from the game which all have new dialogue, e.g. the voodoo lady talks about some features of the commercial version and Guybrush constantly cracks jokes about this being a demo.

The game uses the same control scheme as the most Lucasfilm adventures at the time. On the bottom of the screen are nine verbs displayed. The player clicks on of these verbs and then on an item in the game world to issue a command, e.g. picking something up.</desc>

		<name>Sensible Golf</name>
		<desc>Sensible Golf is a 2D golf simulation.

Having been quite successful with their cute action soccer game Sensible Soccer, Sensible Software decided that the concept of "No fuss, just fun" could be applied to other sports, too. They chose golf.

Sensible Golf is not an accurate simulation of golf, but an action adaptation of the sport streamlined for quick and easy gameplay. Consequently, complications such as wind and terrain heights are not featured, although the green has little arrows indicating the slopes. Apart from that, the player's only concerns are the water and sand hazards, and the distance to the hole. As a result, Sensible Golf is instead a practice in target shooting, rather than a golf game.

Striking involves only two action: Aiming the pointer in the desired direction, and pressing the action button three times. The game uses the well-known three-click-control, with which you set power and swerve of the strike. The computer automatically suggests a proper club, but the player may change it manually. A pop-up map helps one find their bearing.

The courses are fictional, composed from a pool of holes which often appear in multiple courses, sometimes with minor variations. Play modes include single 18-hole rounds, a complete season and a tournament. Up to 72 human players may participate in the latter.</desc>

The basic control system involves loose control, making running with the ball a skill to master, and putting the emphasis on one-touch passing, which can be easily performed by tapping the fire button.

The game features customisable league and cup competitions as well as pre-set ones including the 1992 European Championships. There are 168 teams in total, 40 European nations, the 64 top club sides, and 64 custom teams with names ranging from self-indulgent to comical, and their details are fully editable. At club and country level, each team has three star players who are more gifted that the others.</desc>

SWOS is a top down football/management game, with either quick game or 20-year career player-manager options. The games are set to last 3 minutes, but the 20-year career can suck in your entire life for a few months. The graphics are kept very small so the player can orientate themselves on the pitch without need for a radar. The controls are simple, easy to get used to and very effective. In the full career mode you can jump from club-to-club buying any of the game's 29000+ players, as well as play around with team tactics.

And you can choose from 1400 teams over the five continents.</desc>

The Sentinel scans further round the landscape every few seconds - if you're caught in his gaze, or rather the square you are standing on can be seen, you'll have about 5 seconds to teleport to another location (or hit a key to teleport to a random location - which will never be higher, and may be lower than your current level) before the Sentinel begins absorbing your energy, when it reaches zero you will be destroyed. To travel a "robot hull" must be created on a visible square then teleported to, making sure you absorb your old hull to avoid losing energy. Boulders and trees can also be created, trees to block The Sentinels view and boulders can be stacked to gain higher ground.</desc>

The historical map accurately spreads out the Native population of the New World in 1492 and some historical situations can be simulated, such as whether to get the gold of the Aztec and Incas by trade or conquest.</desc>

		<desc>Seymour goes to Hollywood to star in his first motion picture. As he arrives in his limousine, he soon discovers that the Dirk, the studio manager, has disappeared in Miami. Seymour must start production of his film by himself.

Seymour Goes To Hollywood is a platform adventure, another Dizzy clone, this time replacing the egg character with an amorphous blob of unknown origin. Like in the Dizzy games, the main objective is to collect everything that isn't nailed down (using the fire button) to solve puzzles. In the upper left portion of the screen sits an inventory with three slots and besides that the score points and the energy bar. Seymour loses energy when touching dangerous objects and hazardous environments. When the bar gets empty, Seymour transforms into a pile of bones and the player loses one life. The game starts with three lives (shown as clack boards under the energy bar) and no way of saving progress.</desc>

		<desc>Shadow Dancer is a one-player game in which you control Shinobi. With the help of your dog, you must kill your enemies while you venture through locations such as airports, railroads, waterfalls, sewers, and more.  Furthermore, you must find and disarm several bombs along the way before you leave each. You also have the option of using magic against enemies, which may consist of tornadoes or fireballs.

There are five missions you must complete; and each one has different objectives such as obstructing the enemies deadly mission, disrupting the enemy's supply route, raiding the enemy's industrial units, attacking the enemy's underground forces, and liberating and securing the shuttle's base. Each mission consists of three stages and there is a boss on each of the mission's final stages. 

What's good about the dog, you say? Well, if you tell it to, the dog will maul enemies (provided that the dog barks at them when you face them) and distract them long enough so that you can shoot at them. Remember that you have a limited time to do this, as the enemy will eventually kick the dog off him. This causes the dog to yelp and shrink, making him powerless against them.</desc>

The control system is designed around a one-button controller, but still offers 25 moves for each player, with special moves executed by spinning the joystick round 180 degrees. Each arena features multi-layer parallax, with up to 80 colors.</desc>

		<desc>Using the same graphical interface as Deja Vu, Shadowgate is an adventure game set in a fantasy world. Players take the part of an adventurer sent to the ancient keep of Shadowgate on a quest to find a mystic artifact known as the Staff of Ages and stop the evil Warlock Lord from summoning a horrific demon known as the Behemoth. However Shadowgate has become infested with the Warlock Lord's demonic minions, not to mention the castle's still functional booby-traps.

Unlike Deja Vu, death comes at you suddenly, unexpectedly, and most of all OFTEN. Such simple acts as pulling the wrong switch or opening the wrong door can cause you to be skewered by a booby-trap or disemboweled by a monster. It's allso worth mentioning the fact that if your torch burns out (this happens quite regularly) and you forget to light a new one, you'll trip in the dark and break your neck.

A Windows 3.x update to this game was created in 1991.</desc>

		<name>Shadowlands</name>
		<desc>Viewed isometrically, this role-playing game saw you leading a party of four intrepid souls on a mission to restore peace to the land. Sixteen levels awaited them, all filled with traps and monsters. Spells could be collected as the game went on, and multiple ones cast in quick succession. The characters could be split, and sent off on different routes and tasks to save time.

The game’s title was inspired by its innovative use of light, or rather of darkness. Nothing could be seen without the torches your characters had; these meant that vision faded outside their circular arc. You had to manoeuvre the torch around to reveal secret areas, and it could be used to ward off some monsters, although it alerted others to your presence.</desc>

She had been taken away from her mother's cottage by the dragon-form of the Beast Mage, Zelek, servant to Maletoth. Along the way, Aarbron befriends the wise dragon Barloom and must defeat the evil dragon Ishran. Tree Pygmies in the forest and the goblins in the Crystal Caverns serve as interactive, complicated foes. For example, a bottle of booze picked up at the Karamoon oasis must be given to the goblin jailer to free Aarbron from his cell. Only after Aarbron gives the old man his ring and his parchment does he obtain a spell powerful enough to harm Zelek.</desc>

		<desc>While very young, Aarbron was kidnapped and enslaved by the Priests of the Beast Lord. He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes the face. Of his father.
As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard.

Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit computer era is a side-scrolling platformer best known for the use of parallax scrolling along lush graphics, a musical score  by David Whittaker, a iconic cover by Roger Dean and what many consider to be unforgiving gameplay, balancing between the "very challenging" and the "impossible". The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.</desc>

You have four characters to control in this real time RPG, and the designers have done their best to remove all the numbers usually involved in RPG's (dexterity/wisdom etc) and replaced them with friendlier looking graphical bars. Another good idea is the way you can put your characters in formation instead of having to move them one at a time. The other big innovative game system is the clever use of light: Teque's "Photoscaping" system which means you can only see a few feet in front of you and you can use flares and torches to light up areas.</desc>

		<desc>Shadow Warriors is a direct port of the arcade version of Ninja Gaiden. It is a beat'em up in the veins of Double Dragon featuring Ryu Hayabusa, a ninja who must fight members of an evil cult who seek to fulfil Nostradamus' end of the world prophecies.

Ryu Hayabusa can attack his enemies using his his bare hands and feet or using a sword (for a limited time). He can also perform moves such as a flying neck throw, a back flip and hang kicks, performed while hanging in scenario objects. Throwing enemies against objects such as phone cabins, oil drums or dumpsters will destroy them, revealing power ups such as health items and swords. At some points, Ryu will have to perform acrobatic moves to carry on. He has a life bar starting with 5 units.

The game takes place in United States' locations such as Las Vegas, North Carolina, Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon and Brooklyn. The enemies in those stages are mostly of the same 5 kinds, including Jason Vorhees' look-alikes and other masked men. There is a boss fight at the end of each stage.

A two-player co-operative game is also featured. Whenever the player dies, a continue screen will appear showing Ryu chained to a table while a circular saw descends upon him.</desc>

You are armed with a limited amount of ammo plus a few Molotov Cocktails to throw - both of these can be replenished from bonus items. As well as on the streets, enemies also appear in cars and through windows (there's a special bonus for shooting these).

However, you can cheat as well, as you can resize your stick to fill the whole table width, or add one in the middle, and see who breaks glass first. There are single plays or the tournament where you play opponents in order of difficulty. The winner is the one who reaches 15 glassbreaks first.</desc>

		<name>Shuttle - The Space Flight Simulator</name>
		<desc>Shuttle is a 1992 space flight simulator game developed by Vektor Grafix and published by Virgin Games. It has been praised as a reasonably accurate simulation game of piloting the NASA Space Shuttle. The software is noted for simulations of the space shuttle in many situations in a 3D environment, from leaving the Vehicle Assembly Building to returning to Earth at the Shuttle Landing Facility and displayed almost every switch, knob and display of the real shuttle control panels while simulating most of their respective functions. That said, only a subset of the controls actually worked and a number simply made the shuttle explode; however, it's quite likely that many of the same controls (e.g. separating the Solid Rocket Boosters while they were still burning during the launch) would make a real shuttle explode, as well. The operation of the General Purpose Computers (GPC) required the input of the according program commands for the current flight situation, albeit in a simplified fashion. Shuttle for the PC was released on two 360k floppy disks, however it could be copied to a single 1.44MB floppy and installed or run from there. Gameplay consisted of flying through simulations of a number of different space shuttle missions, starting with the Approach and Landing Tests where the original space shuttle, Enterprise, was flown from the back of a modified Boeing 747 to a gliding landing at Edwards Air Force Base, through to launching the Hubble Space Telescope, building a space station, using the Manned Maneuvering Unit to capture satellites for repairs, and launching 'secret' military satellites. The level of detail went so far, that the External Tank (ET) painted in white color was only displayed in the earliest available scenarios while the later one displayed the brown it wore later on. As the missions themselves were fairly complex, the game would optionally provide a high level of hand-holding. Instructions were passed to the player on a 'teleprinter', and when those instructions required the player to use the shuttle controls, the appropriate switch or knob would be indicated by a flashing box. As such, the normally massive amount of material the player would be required to read through in order to know how to accurately and safely pilot a shuttle were condensed into something the average player could understand, another point of praise for the game by its users. The camera zooms in on the Space Shuttle launch stack (MS-DOS) To further ease gameplay,</desc>

They must save the earth from the mercenary invaders of Bozon. You must first reach Bozon’s territories, then wipe out its forces hidden in caverns and lurking in underground seas, before destroying the main invasion ship. Lots of extra weapons can be picked up, often with similar tokens to those in 1943 and some other Capcom titles. Most weapons can be shot either to the left or the right, giving you more range to launch attacks.</desc>

		<desc>This vertically scrolling shoot 'em up varies from the standard for this style of game, as it also features a degree of horizontal scrolling. The screen area moves across as you reach the edge of the screen and reveals a whole new range of enemies. These include lots of static turrets as well as cannon-fodder waves of enemies.

There are 6 levels and each level starts and ends with you travelling through a tunnel, and emerging on the other side faced with a new graphical setting, be it industrial, space or woodland. After clearing the last level the tunnel leads back to the first level, so there is no real ending to the game. There are no end bosses, instead each level ends with a more difficult part with a large ground structure and increased enemies and turrets. There are 3 difficulty levels to choose from, and a 2 player mode.

Interestingly, the game was not only released for Amiga and PC, but also as a coin-op  machine for arcades. The arcade version is identical to the Amiga version, the arcade PCB  even contains parts of the Amiga operating system.</desc>

		<desc>Football fever hots up some more as Sierra release their own entry into the computer game World Cup, and it's a very competent and extremely playable arcade soccer game it is one of the most instantly playable arcade football engines yet seen.

Let's begin at the beginning. You can either play as a team in the official World Cup draw, or take part in a random one. Up to eight people can play at once, each selecting a team and playing through their respective groups until victory or rejection. Playing a game is incredibly easy, far easier than the Kick Offs and Sensible Soccers of this world. The reason being that there are none of the combinations and strange joystick positions of those games. Have no fear, as Sierra Soccer is just as addictive and just as much fun. Whether you have an A500 or an A1200, you'll be amazed at the spectacular animation of the players on the pitch. Over 4000 frames of animation have the players running, jumping, sliding, falling face down and there's even a fully mobile referee, complete with working whistle. A1200 owners get the benefit of a full 3D crowd too!

It may not have a big licence behind it, but Sierra Soccer is still great fun to play, and well worth adding to any collection.</desc>

The few remaining US carriers are fighting a desperate war against the Japanese surface fleets. But the US has a secret weapon: sleek, silent, deadly... you are a Submarine Commander!

The action is viewed from within the submarine. Watch out for your speed, direction and depth. This game features 9 types of submarines to choose from, 10 types of torpedoes to fire, 14 Japanese surface ships (9 warships, 5 transport), and the entire Pacific Ocean as your battleground. The seven missions all recreate real US navy engagements. Can you sink the Yamato???</desc>

For a long while after Pearl Harbor, you are the only forces capable of striking back at the Japanese in the Pacific. Take one of the "fleet boats" and go on extended patrols of up to 2 months from Hawaii, Australia, or New Zealand. Set your difficulty/realism level and time period (early means less tech for juicier targets, later means tougher escorts, more tech, lousier targets). Contend with factors like dud torpedoes, maximum depth, and more. 

You can choose among practice run against some old hulks, recreate historical convoy attacks, go on a single patrol, or go on your own campaign, which lets you go multiple patrols until you die, get promoted, or survive the war.

Player 1 would play as a helicopter, but if a second player joined the game, they would play as a jeep. Both players would have to protect each other as well as themselves. After a certain number of kills, a "goose" helicopter would form on the screen. If the players managed to destroy it they would get a weapons powerup. This would go on throughout the entire game (a "goose" could appear even during the end of level baddie!).</desc>

SimAnt at heart is a simple game and doesn't have all the glittery action of adventure and action games but it is, after all, a simulation. What it does have is a great deal of integrity, intrigue and interaction and provides literally hours of immersive game play. The interface, as in most Maxis games, is intuitive and very easy to use. Graphics are what you might expect from an ant simulation, fairly simple in appearance but detailed enough to allow meaningful text, charts and graphs to enhance control. Sound effects are very well done and, in fact, can be toggled off if you don't like the sounds of ant carnage before breakfast.

SimAnt has an amazing amount of strategy involved in managing the survival skills. With a great interface and easy game control system, it's a breeze to play. Various modes offer depth of game play. Replay value depends on how much effort you want to put into managing a virtual ant colony.</desc>

The first task is to place essentials such as housing, transport links, schools, factories and shops. There are 50 types of these, allowing for homes of all standards and different types of businesses. Make sure to consider which sites are effective for which tasks. Some power sources pollute, others don't but are more expensive. Taxes must be raised to ensure an income, and then portions allocated to public services such as policing and roads. Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency situations that must be dealt to contain any damage.

Successful mayoring will cause the small village to grow into a town, then a city and finally a metropolis. As the city's size grows so do it's needs. Commercial buildings may suddenly find that they need an airport to expand trade, or housing may find itself changing rapidly as vast amounts of people come and leave.

The game also includes 8 pre-defined time-limited scenarios, with specific challenges and targets. The environment varies in each game (especially if you have the Terrain Editor add on), and this should affect your choices.</desc>

		<desc>Sim Earth, another classic from the Sim something series, puts you into the role of God. A whole planet lies beneath you, on which you can simply control everything: The nature, the species, cosmic catastrophes, everything you like.

Like any Sim-game, this one relies heavily on independent players, since there is no story or concrete goal. All you have to and can do is try to play as long as possible, and boy, are you lucky that 1000 years in the game are only 10 seconds in real-time ! The big drawback of this game is not the fact that the graphics are WAY sub-average (although the resolution is high res!) and that sound is almost non-existent. No, the biggest drawback, compared to Sim City or Sim Ants is that this game has no real appeal to anyone but science students, geologists and pseudo-intellectuals.

This game is for those who find Railroad Tycoon or Civilization way too amusing, for those who think that good graphics are something unwanted and distracting from the real core of a game, or for those who think that dropping Ã¢â‚¬Å“I played through Sim EarthÃ¢â‚¬Â will let them get all the chicks.</desc>

		<name>Sink or Swim</name>
		<desc>Your name is Kevin Codner – rescue mariner extraordinaire, answering the distress call of a sinking cruise liner, the SS Lucifer. You set off in your little submarine and board the ship where a horde of passengers desperately need your keen oversight and "shipsmarts".

In 60 levels you have to rescue as many passengers (dubbed the Dim Passengers) as possible. At the beginning the passengers fall through a tube in the level. Similar to Lemmings you have to find a way for the passengers to the exit of the level. In order to do so, you must blast hindrances such cargo boxes and bulkheads with bombs or, when no bombs are left, reposition the boxes with a crane. There are also conveyor belts in the levels. If the belt moves in the wrong way, the passengers either can't use it or may even be transported to their dooms, being dropped off into water, fire or steam jets. You can usually choose the direction of the belts by pulling a lever.

There are several types of scenarios that Kevin Codner (you) are faced with throughout the game. Of course the puzzles get progressively more difficult, involving things like patching up cracked pipes to stop a lethal jet of steam from cooking the distressed passengers. You can blast away obstacles and stack crates in creative manners. For instance, you can have them fall onto each other to form a bridge across a gap or to provide shielding from fire. This is usually done by hoisting them onto conveyor belts using a crane.

Each level has a certain "save limit", meaning you have to save at least a certain amount of passengers. This again is akin a bit towards Lemmings, and lots of levels have a built-in time limit, represented be water pouring into the compartment, rising ominously. When the water rises high enough, the passengers will get carried along with it, and they can only swim for a short period of time before getting exhausted and drowning, so you'd better be on time with some assistance.

At the end of each level you receive a password (again, Lemmings-style) so that you may pick up your game from the current level without having to progress through them all from the get-go.</desc>

		<desc>Sir Fred was a brave and noble knight in love with a beautiful damsel, but evil Ultimor, an ugly dwarf with magical powers, casted a spell upon him and minimized to the size of the dwarf. Enemies were laughing at him, and other dwarfs were attacking him. What he should do? Yes, he should find and defeat Ultimor, return his size to be brave and noble enough, and to win back his belle.

The gameplay flows in 2D side-scrolling mode, where you may use your sword, throw the daggers, and avoid the enemies. You may walk, jump and run, and perform this not in one plane. Background, foreground and middle planes are available to change. The daggers should be thrown to eliminate as enemies with range weapons as flying and hard-to-reach ones. Different items should be collected such as keys, other daggers, etc. 

There are several themed levels such as forest, grotto, castle, etc. in the game. To finish the level you should find the key and proceed with it to the entrance of next level. Your energy is represented by apples, and you should collect them also. Sometimes magic star appears on the level. It should be destroyed to eliminate all visible enemies. Magic potions are also differ either to give invincibility or to restore your energy.</desc>

You are in control of a small vehicle, which allows you to move boxes and barrels to their destination easily. One day, after a big load has just arrived, you are asked to move the whole goods received to their destination. Happily you start without to know what will expect you. After a short time, you notice that the whole load is in a mess and it will take you a lot of time and reflection to move everything into the right place. So sit down in your vehicle and start your work. Unfortunately you got to hurry up as well, because tomorrow morning your boss will examine the stock.</desc>

Kadaver is apparently a former mortician who has dabbled in cryogenics ever since he purchased Deadly Enforcement Aggressive Destruction Incorporated, aka DEAD Inc. Now he has the power to unleash mutants called Psykogenix on the population of Monstro City! The Military Ascertainment Department (MAD) has decided to call upon the world's most vicious mercenaries: the Skeleton Krew.

Skeleton Krew has you choosing between three members of the deadly organization: Spine, Joint, and Rib. The object of the game is to make it through four planets on your way to stop Kadaver's nefarious plans.

The areas include Earth, Mars, Venus and finally the Psykogenesis Planet, where you will infiltrate DEAD HQ. A second player can join in for simultaneous play, and you can continue your game via passwords. Skeleton Krew features three difficulty levels.</desc>

Only you, Skrull the Barbarian, the incredible bastard son of the unnatural love between the Sun Woman and the Shadow Man, can free the Light again. But the gloomy world of Darkness is full of dangers...

The game represents a Barbarian clone, where you should select the available icon to allow your protagonist seen in third-person side-scrolling view perform the action. Right and left mouse buttons clicks invoke opposite actions. For example, left mouse button click on 'Move Left' icon will move Skrull left, while right mouse button click will move him right. There are seven icons to use: Stop, Move, Run, Jump, Use Sword, Up, Down. Several items may be collected in three inventory slots to be used later. In particular, such item may be a key dropped from dead Dragon to unlock a certain door.

The environment is labyrinth of dark, damp, and dangerous caves with many obstacles such as gaps to be jumped over and many different enemies such as tarantulas, vampire bats, or dragons. The key to world of Light's salvation lies hidden somewhere here and should be found by you finally.</desc>

Your job is to travel through the 99 continents and clean each one in sequence.

Skweek can move in each of the four compass directions, and is armed with a simple weapon, whose shots rebound around before they hit one of Pitark's minions, the Schnoreuls - contact with which is instantly fatal. Some squares contain arrows which force you in a particular direction, while there are also blockades to avoid. Bomb squares blow up surrounding squares but give you time to move away from them as they do this, while Shortcut squares allow you to move to another teleport-type square by pushing the joystick in its direction.</desc>

		<desc>Normally this type of deep and involved adventure game is just my cup of tea, especially if it is in a 3-D world vein. Sleeping Gods Lie though is an odd game. The puzzles are in there just waiting to be found and the game has considerable depth but to its detriment there is a heck of a lot of wandering around vast, barren terrain as well. The slow moving pace put me off initially but once I got down to some serious mapping it became quite a compelling adventure romp. The accompanying sound effects are surprisingly poor but the title screen music has a certain charm. Sprite expansion is well implemented but I found the character animation and movement occasionally a bit messy to look at. In short, a little long-winded but enjoyable all the same.</desc>

Sounds simple enough, except for one thing, there's another player (either computer or human) trying to do the same thing.

This results in incredibly hectic gameplay. Add this to the fact that sometimes you're negatively charged to the puck (and thus kick it away) or positively charged (so the puck sticks to you) and you're in for a crazy time!</desc>

Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.

Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.</desc>

		<desc>If there was ever a game that could win an award for being the most sponsored in the software industry, this would have to be it. Not only is The Sun newspaper behind it, but so are Fizzy Chewits and Domino Pizzas. It's a shame they had to sponsor such a terrible game. No, scratch that, Snapperazzi is staggeringly terrible.

You play the Snapper, a small but willing photographer who wants to get into the world of the paparazzi. To prove his worth to The Sun editor, he has to race around some large, jerky levels, taking pictures of some of the most misshapen sprites ever seen, while collecting rolls of film and trying to avoid bills, shops and anything else that might try to takes his money. He also needs to collect enough delicious Domino pizzas, so he can then build a space ship to take him to the next level.

I'm sorry, but this is really a dreadful game. The joystick controls are sticky and wooden feeling, the sound effects are drab and basic, and the garish use of background colours gives the game a very confused look. I can't think of anything positive about this game at all. Even the box front looks like it was thrown together in the dark.</desc>

Although scheduled for release in mid-1991 and completed, the Amiga conversion was never published. Later, the game was rediscovered and released for free.</desc>

You've land missions like free flight, destroy drug labs, bomb drug refineries, destroy drug stores and destroy drug convoy. You've aircraft carrier missions like free flight, destroy enemy aircraft carriers, destroy drug ships and destroy enemy oil supplies. 
In the air you can fight the MiG-27, Su-27, MiG-29 and MiG-31 armed with heat or radar guided missiles!

You can choose to be an existing pilot or to create a new one. 
You can choose between 2 levels of difficulty: beginner (less enemy attacks) or expert (the most dangerous).
The weather will affect the mission. The good weather will be great for training, and the stormy will be dangerous but great for attacks, as you can hide into the clouds and approach the enemy unnoticed.
You'll have a copilot that will help you telling what's going on every moment. 
You can avoid missiles using your skills, using chaff or... if you can't, you can use your parachute!</desc>

Score three goals to reach the next level - initially you will face another soccer-based table with more defenders. Other football-themed elements include 'throw-in' positions from the side and pop-up players to toggle for points. 

On the Amiga version, the later tables have a casino and gambling as a theme. Gameplay is fundamentally the same - hit the correct targets in sequence to advance, with other targets adding to your score.</desc>

You are John Kayle, an adventurer and archeologist, trying to recover important artefacts in four different places of the world, competing with a mysterious secret society.

The game features ten levels spanning four worlds, with different graphics and enemies. Each level's goal is to find an artefact which will lead the  way to the next world. Most enemies can be killed by jumping onto them. It is important to hit them from above. Touching an enemy's side or contact from below are lethal for the hero. After collecting 50 gems of any kind you will be granted an extra life. Each level is concluded by a statistics screen. It will display the number of collected items and killed enemies, opposed to total numbers. Upon reaching the maximum possible numbers, an extra bonus is granted.</desc>

The evil demon Taar-Ka has occupied the lovely kingdom of Tan Tao, which is why Son Shu-Shi is now allowed to act as a savior in the emergency. Technically very well balanced game, very colourful with beautiful background. The sound effects are clear and crisp and music is everywhere.

This is a brilliant platformer. Gameplay is no slouch and helps to make it thoroughly entertaining with fast and frantic playability. So beautiful and very addictive. Now I  need Ã¢â‚¬Å“one more goÃ¢â‚¬Â.</desc>

		<desc>Sooty and Sweep are two famous characters from British children TV that have appeared in various shows for more than fifty years. This platformer is the first game featuring the characters and they have got themselves into some problems. Matthew has gone out and left Sooty in charge of the house. Problem is that Sweep has left all his old bones all over the house and left the door to the garden open so that all kinds of bugs have gotten in.
 The game simply involves collecting all of the bones while avoiding the creepy crawlies that are occupying the house. The player can choose to play as either Sooty or Sweep and they differ in the weapon they use. Sooty uses a magic wand while Sweep uses a water pistol. They both have the same effect on the enemies though, stunning them for a few seconds so that the player can move past. Different items can be picked up. Keys are needed to unlock doors, sticky buns can be used to attract the bugs, magic boxes recharges the wand while water bottles refill the water pistol. There is also a two player mode where Sooty and Sweep compete in getting the largest score. This is done by snatching each others bones and by throwing custard pies.</desc>

		<name>Sorcerer Lord</name>
		<desc>Sorcerer Lord is a medieval fantasy game of tactical warfare.

The evil Shadowlord's army is threatening to overrun the peaceful country of Galanor. The alliance of races in Galanor isn't very fond of suppression, slavery or extinction, so they are preparing for war -- it's your job to coordinate the Galanorian defense.

Movement and combat are turn-based. You and the Shadowlord alternately recruit new troops, move armies on a 2D hex-map of the land and try to conquer the enemies garrisons. The outcome of fights is shown as plain text only. Although the gameplay is quite simple, there are a few tactical knacks like certain races fighting more fiercely in certain terrain types, fatigue levels and basic statistics for army leaders. Despite the game's title, magic is a rather unimportant element of chance in battles and not under your direct control.

The game contains a time limit; you've got 40 turns in easy level, less in advanced levels.</desc>

		<desc>Actual Screenshots' game, Sorceror's Apprentice, places you in the part of wisened old man blessed with the King's magic powers. The reason for this gilt is because the King wants you to free the land from the forces of darkness.

I must admit to finding the gameplay of Sorceror's Apprentice somewhat tiresome and monotonous albeit playable. The first few credits kept me addicted so that I could progress to allow me to see later levels, but I soon saw it was a case of Ã¢â‚¬Å“seen it, done itÃ¢â‚¬Â. The graphics are far superior to the sound, although I still wasn't satisfied with what should be up to sixteen-bit standard.

In terms of graphics, Sprites are nicely drawn that jump and move fairly smoothly across bland and simplistic backdrops. The explosions are rather poor, and the overall effect is polished but could be hotter. Sounds are slightly worst than the graphics, as there is nothing to write home about.

Overall, a great disappointment that is best avoided.</desc>

		<desc>You might be surprised to note that despite coming on five disks, Space Ace II only really gives you about four sequences of action, which are then subdivided into the tiny little blow-by-blow segments or scenes which you actually play. This, coupled with the tendency of the animations and samples to be cut off abruptly, gives the game a very bitty feel. Secondly, it's lazy. The same death sequences are used repeatedly, even in very different scenarios.

Game looks pretty, and it's moderately entertaining for about the first 3 minutes but you will finish it inside three hours (absolute maximum) and you'll hate it so much by the end that you'll never want to see it again.</desc>

Now Ace/Dexter must not only rescue his girlfriend Kimberly but also prevent the destruction of the Earth at the hands of Borf.

Readysoft's version of the laserdisc arcade game Space Ace for 16-bit computers follows the mold of their earlier Dragon's Lair adaptation: only selected scenes from the original game are used, with all the graphics redrawn from the original cel animation to fit the capabilities of the target machines.

As in Dragon's Lair, the game consists of the cartoon movie running by itself, with the player being required to press the right button at the right time (either moving or firing Ace's gun) or see one of many death animations. The original arcade game offered some alternate paths through the game by letting the player choose between playing as Dexter or turning him back into Ace - the computer version is missing this option, and one always plays as Dexter or Ace depending on the scene.</desc>

		<desc>2039 A.D. Man begins deep space exploration in search of new life forms and usable fuel sources. What he discovers is trouble.

Until now, the success of past explorations was causing the space effort to grow by leaps and bounds. Until now, the explorers had found little more than fungus and small insects as alternative
lifeforms. Until now, the chief dangers had been 
those posed by the hostile environment of space. Until now, the aliens had not known about THEM.

On the ragged edge of the galaxy, other creatures that roam the stars discover humans and spaceships to be excellent sources of food and other resources. Prepared at the worst for clashes with rival exploration teams, the human crews can do little to
defend themselves as wave upon wave of nightmare
creatures descend upon their ships and bases.

In response to their distress calls, the Federation has assembled a series of rescue teams, lead by their best military sharpshooters, to deal with the alien menace. As the leader of one of these teams, you must gun down the intruders and pick up the human survivors. Brave the maze of dark corridors that may lead to a deadly shootout between you and legions of monsters. Pick up survivors and extra ammo on the way.</desc>

Armed with a really big gun, you have to defend yourself against the alien hordes using your wits to navigate around the screen. But watch out for those end of level bosses! Originating in the arcades, Space Harrier is a third-person rail shooter with pseudo-3D graphics, set in the same world as Fantasy Zone. The lone titular hero fights aliens with a fireball-launching cannon, which can also be used to transform the hero into a flying rocket. The protagonist is constantly in motion, but the speed of his movement can be regulated by the player.</desc>

There are 13 stages to complete by jetting around and blasting bad guys and bosses as they approach. The game is played from behind the main character and the landscape rushes up in 3D similar to the effect used in many car games such as Outrun.

The game uses many of the enemies and bosses from the first Space Harrier, but adds an array of new ones as well.</desc>

No more Shredded Wheat for you, mate. So what's behind all this? A band of deadly, virus-like aliens which have infected every part of the planet with their horrible disease, that's what. Pretty nasty, huh? So absolutely, horrendously nasty, in fact, that the combined efforts of the army, the navy, the air force, the fire service, the police, Machomen and Postman Pat have been totally liquidised in their attempt to stop it.

Just when you thought that the end of the world was nigh, when everybody thought it was OK to eat lots of cream cakes 'cos they were gonna die tomorrow anyway, a little speck became visible in the sky. Was it a bird? Was it a helicopter? Was it a speck of chocolate on your glasses? Nope, da da daaaaaa Ã¢â‚¬â€œ it was Space Harrier. Yeaaah!

With nothing but a laser and a jetpack to his name, he battles through waves of ugly looking aliens, dodges dangerous missiles, survives end-of-level tussles with great, big enormous fire-breathing dragons, tries to stop himself from splatting, slap bang into the nearest obstacles, get his eyebrows singed and still survives.
Some selfless guy, huh? Not really. He just couldn't face another day without three Shredded Wheat.</desc>

Players control a squad of Space Marines in an maze allowing 90 degree turns which they may view through multiple first person cameras or using an overhead map. Their mission: to wipe out the Genestealers, a vicious alien race inhabiting the derelict ships.

The 5-man squad (sometimes accompanied by another), encased in Terminator armors and armed with long range and melee weapons, can be given tactical orders (executed simultaneously) via map - with an option to temporarily freeze time (to give player more room for thinking).

The game features 51 missions, including tutorial and original Deathwing campaign. The CD-ROM re-release adds extra 9 missions and more digitized speech (in slightly better quality).</desc>

There he has to shoot a certain amount of enemies to get access to the next level which increases the difficulty. Enemies either try to ram the player or shoot rockets.

New in comparison to the original Space Pilot is the power up system: shot enemies may leave symbols behind which grant advantages when picked up, e.g. a shield, automatic fire (both for a limited amount of time) or another weapon. The symbol changes if it is shot. The game scrolls in multiple directions and all few levels there is a boss to defeat.</desc>

This time he intends to infest the planet Xenon with thousands of genetically engineered door-to-door life insurance salesmen. The last thing he wants is you, ace-janitor Roger Wilco, messing things up and so you are captured and brought to the planet Labion to spend the rest of your days working in Vohaul's mines. Fortunately the shuttle that takes you to the mines crashes and you're the only survivor.

Can you survive the dangers of the jungle planet Labion?nnCan you stop the evil Sludge Vohaul?

Space Quest 2: Vohaul's Revenge is the second game in Sierra's humorous Space Quest series of adventure games. It's a classic adventure game with a text-parser: you move Roger Wilco around with arrow keys, and interact with the world by typing commands. As in every Space Quest game, there are lots of ways to die.</desc>

		<desc>Narrowly escaping the events of Space Quest II: Vohaul's Revenge, Roger Wilco's escape pod floats through space. As just another metallic item of junk, it's soon picked up by an interstellar garbage hauler. Waking up in a pile of trash, quite familiar for this janitor-turned-hero, Roger Wilco must somehow escape. Once given access to the rest of the galaxy, he'll soon find himself having to avoid a collections cyborg for payments overdue, dealing with the corporate prison of software company Scummsoft, and having to digest the greasy food from the galaxy's finest hamburger joint. All this and he might be expected to get the high score playing Astro Chicken (tm) also!

Space Quest 3 is a graphical adventure. The mouse is functional for movement and inventory access, however the game primarily relies on a text parser for specific commands and manipulation of objects on screen. In addition to the regular game, there is also a simple non-scrolling Astro Chicken game that's playable, as well as a radar screen representation for ship-to-ship space combat.</desc>

		<name>Space Quest IV : Roger Wilco and the Time Rippers</name>
		<desc>When reading the documentation is more fun than playing the game, you know that you are on to a loser. Space Quest IV is a very dry, slow affair which seems to ignore all the encouraging advanced made in the adventure genre over the last couple of years.

The story concerns Roger being plucked from his own time and dumped back on his home planet Xenon far into the future. The place is looking a bit worse for wear and zombies wander the street. As it turns out this is the result of a super computer having gone mad after being infected by a virus caught from a pirate copy of Leisure Suit Larry (and if you think that is a hoot, then the humour is just about on your level Ã¢â¬â it never gets any better).

The old-fashioned 16-bit graphics are, to put it politely, hideous, and the animation, such as there is, makes Roobarb And Custard look like a Disney classic. The other big problem is with the gameplay itself Ã¢â¬â there is very little interaction with other characters. For the first quarter of the game, if you try to talk to anyone, you end up dead seconds later Ã¢â¬â hardly an incentive to continue.

It is hard to imagine even real adventure buffs enjoying this much. It is very old-fashioned and has an air of tiredness about it. Avoid.</desc>

Prepare to save the world, well Xenon, our hero's home planet, as Roger Wilco tumbles into The Sarien Encounter. Inconveniently for Roger - he's in the middle of a nap - the universe has chosen this exact moment to begin falling apart. No more sleep for Roger.

Full to the brim with Hitchhiker-type humour, it puts the threadbare fabric of recent adventures to shame. It should be an integral part of every ambitious collection, if you have an A3000. Everyone else will be sorely tired by long loading sessions, slow animation and gritty graphics. Sci-fi fanatics must play it, others still can, though Sierra should do their homework and deliver versions that are as much fun on a standard Amiga because they deserve to remain classics.</desc>

It's the 25th century and life is boring. War exists only in history books, disease and hunger are long since eradicated, this galaxy's secrets are exposed and prospected. Danger and excitement are gone from the world, except for the deadly Space Race Tournaments.
You are Earth's champion Racer, its ultimate hero. As a space-age gladiator, you dice with death to thrill the crowds. Now the Rulers send you to challenge the best racers in the universe.
Three planets, three different racetracks, and then...The Finals! Turn too wide and lose your power. One false move and you'll crash into the dangerous guard poles. Mines on the track can blow you away, one slip and your opponents will ride you down or blast you to oblivion. You have a laser cannon. You'll need it, but the cannon drains power, so you'll need your skill and cunning more.
As you twist and turn across the alien terrain, amazing 3-D animation makes it a real race through Space and Time.
You are there, in the race of the future, and there is no tomorrow.
The games have begun. Earth's honor is at stake. And so is your life!</desc>

		<name>TASAR: Terran Armed Search And Rescue</name>
		<desc>Space Ranger takes the Defender theme, and develops it into a far superior game. A multitude of highly imaginative, friendly looking critters (as they are called), innocently go about their daily business. Most are ground-based, and run up and down or leap into the air. Others swoop around the sky, merrily tweeting and quacking. All this is set against a three speed parallax scrolling background of mountains and forests.

But here come no-good aliens to put a downer on things. A mother ship hovers in wait for any unsuspecting critters to wander beneath it. It then turns on a tractor beam which pulls them into the craft. A well aimed shot will kill these, freeing the poor little cubes. On the other hand, a poorly aimed shower of laser fire could easily result in a critter being shot.

Space Ranger's appeal is mainly in its cuteness. The effective backgrounds make the game a pleasure to watch. Defender variants are nothing new, but this is the best I've seen. Space Ranger is also fun to play, and whilst not stunning, is an example to be followed by other budget companies. Definitely one of the best cheapies around. Highly recommended.</desc>

Space flight takes place in two different modes: Cruise Flight, which is ideal for travelling quickly, and Newtonian Flight, which works best for combat and precision flying. There are also three different camera views for the 3D exploration and combat. Each planetary system has a variety of destinations and obstacles to travel through via a top-down navigational map. Traveling to an outpost, a space station, or any other location with the star system can be done simply by selecting it and charting a course, or in real-time 3D flight mode.</desc>

The concept of the game is very reminiscent of the 1975 film Rollerball. The original game was developed by Bitmap Brothers, with various remakes for many platforms since being published. It is a sequel to the 1988 game Speedball.</desc>

		<desc>The original future sport game, Speedball is played out on a small court with five players on each team, making it more frantic than the more famous sequel. The ball must be thrown into the goal at your opponent's end. Any amount of physical contact can be made, and there are no illegal ways to get the ball or the goal.

Before each match you can bribe the referee into awarding you a head-start or strengthening the abilities of your players. You compete in a simple knockout cup tournament, or in individual 2-player games.</desc>

		<name>Speedboat Assassins</name>
		<desc>You play a real high-flying marine asked to save four famous harbours from enemy forces using just a speedboat and a few missiles.

Viewed from above and behind, like the perspective of a racing game, the boat has to be steered between two lines of mines for the first part of each harbour. Then, with missiles, you must destroy enemy boats and the four communication towers which control them. Later, a helicopter increases your abilities with rocket launchers, speed, maneuverability and smart bombs.

The main sprite isn't bad but the horizon graphics and other sprites are simple and jerky in comparison. At least the water's silly stripes move smoothly. The Amiga version's playable, so you shouldn't have too much trouble reaching the weak shooting sections. This game is not recommended.</desc>

		<desc>Spellbound Dizzy is by far the best escapade the little egg has had. With colourful graphics and the usual Dizzy gameplay.

It's not really worth relating the plot, suffice it to say that our Diz has to save the Yolkfolk from the standard terrible fate. Along the way he has to collect and manipulate various objects, while communicating with certain other characters.

It doesn't push the Amiga to its limits, and neither is it astounding in terms of
originality, but the unique charm of CodeMasters' cartoon hero is undeniable. Perhaps the game's only flaw is that there's a little too much wandering back and forth.

It's not a classic by any means, but you'd be as mad as a March Hare if you haven't at least looked at it yet.</desc>

He is asked by the king to find out the whereabouts of the evil prince Gallus, overpower him, and bring him back to the king to serve his punishment for burning down the palace and murdering Kane the previous day. If Cho succeeds in his quest, the king will hand the throne over to him. Unfortunately, Cho doesn't have anything to start off with, so he must find some weapons and protection before he starts. Your quest begins in Sharma City, where the palace resides. You can talk to people to get some hints on what to do and where to go. Along the way you may find some weapons that can be found hidden in treasure cheats or are given to Cho. Some of these weapons include swords for killing enemies, and bombs for blowing up obstacles that get in your way. Some locations have teleports (one-way only) that will get you from one place to another, and you can reveal any hidden items by shooting any flora.</desc>

		<name>Spherical Worlds</name>
		<desc>Spherical Worlds, as the name doesn't imply, is a two-dimensional adventure in which you take control of a spherical droid whose mission it is to roam the various sectors of a space station.

On loading the game, you are presented with just two options: Start Game or Enter Teleport Code. The game itself is fairly slow going - your spherical battle droid has to skid about a derelict space station, avoiding holes, sliding over ice, shooting other little robots and things, while searching for the exit to the next level. On level two, it gets harder...

There's not much in Spherical Worlds to get you hooked - yes, you can upgrade your weapons and you get to do all sorts of exciting things like use teleports and collect keys - but the graphics are small and uneventful, as is the gameplay. It's okay in a sub Alien Breed 1 and 2 sort of way, and there are a few marginally distracting moments, but it doesn't hold your attention for long.</desc>

		<desc>Solomon's Key is a clear conceptual influence for this action puzzler. Our hero must guide a ball through a level to the spot marked 'In', by creating and removing blocks to alter its path. The game is prevented from being a pure clone due to the ball, which moves automatically once activated, and can be controlled by using strategically-placed blocks.

Simply reaching the ball usually involves modifying the level layout using these bricks. There are enemies moving on fixed paths which must be avoided, and bonus items to collect. Also watch for bonuses such as invincibility, gravity-alteration and teleporting. You take time to rotate, so the controls aren't truly immediate. The ball takes 20 seconds to start moving, so use this time to plan ahead.</desc>

		<desc>After a rough crossing of the North Sea, Spike the Viking is  washed ashore.  He ends up in Transilvania, which seems to be just an ordinary village.  However, he finds out that his shipmates have been captured, and are being imprisoned in the dungeons of the local castle.  Spike must rescue his friends from the mysterious castle, but first he has to escape from the (apparently friendly) villager's house where he finds himself, as the door won't open.

The game is a mix of puzzles and action.  The action involves you dodging various enemies, such as dogs, ghosts, bats, etc, and avoiding the many traps in the dungeons of the castle.

You only have a limited amount of energy, and if you lose all of it by touching enemies or traps, you lose a life.  If you lose all your lives you lose the game.

The puzzles, which are mostly fairly simple, involve both the use of objects, such as money to bribe a guard, and switches that perform various functions, such as deactivating traps.  

Keys are very important, as they are needed to unlock your shipmates' cells.  Some cells are protected by guards, who must be tempted away somehow to get to the cells they are guarding.</desc>

		<desc>On it's most basic level, Spindizzy Worlds is, like its predecessor, similar to Marble Madness. Controlling GERALD, you must move through the isometrically viewed landscape (largely flick-screen on the ST). There are two skill levels; the harder one features more of the precarious ledges and falls of Spindizzy. Each one takes you to a different matrix of levels, which can be played in different orders and each consist of 10 screens, with a bonus level at the end.

You have limited energy, which can be recharged by collecting crystals. Fuel is limited, and is reduced by contact with hazards - generating a replacement GERALD takes time. There are many gates which are opened by running into spaces of the same colour. There are also aliens to avoid, and most movement is along thin slippery ledges with heavily inertia-based controls.</desc>

		<desc>Oh dear. They certainly do not seem to treat kings like they used to. Take that Arthur, for instance Ã¢â‚¬â€œ ruler of all England, bearer of Excalibur, loved by all... or so you might think. Ã¢â‚¬ËœNot so', say Virgin. In fact, his power base has so tenuous that on his death everything fell apart quite rapidly. Lord Constantine was next in line for the throne and armed with a sword and your wits, you play Lord Constantine on a mission to claim your rightful place at Camelot.

Thankfully avoiding the temptation to re-tell the story of King Arthur yet again, Spirit of Excalibur manages to conjure the same atmosphere, use many of the characters from the legend, yet still be fresh and original Ã¢â‚¬â€œ no mean feat. Splitting Constantine's story into five sections gives realistic goals to achieve, which range from taking the throne and recruiting knights to tracking down Lancelot and finally defeating Morgan Le Fey. At the same time everything is presented very nicely indeed.

Spirit of Excalibur has so many things going for it. The strategy and role-playing bits work well, and close up action compares with games such as Defender of the Crown, albeit with greater depth. It is just that the whole thing comes across as badly bodged together, the sum not being equal to the parts. A shame.</desc>

		<name>Spitting Image</name>
		<desc>Spitting Image is based on the long-running British satirical television show with puppet likenesses of political figures and celebrities. A prophet determines that a world war will occur in seven years instigated by a mysterious leader. To avoid this, one ruler of the world must be determined in this beat 'em up involving six rulers: U.S.A.'s Ronald Regan, the U.K.'s Margaret Thatcher, the USSR's Mikhail Gorbachev, South Africa's PW Botha, Iran's Ayathollah Khomeini, and Pope John Paul II.

Having chosen which to play as, you travel to an opponent's country to engage in a best-of-three fight that is judged by Queen Elizabeth II on a postage stamp. You attack each opponent on the ground as well as jumping in the air and each character has a special move like Thatcher's head-butt or Khomeini's beard whip. You can also call for help twice from an aide who will usually throw a projectile at your opponent. If you manage to defeat all 5 opponents, you will meet the mysterious leader in a final showdown in a mud-wrestling pit in the dark where you will only be able to see the eyes of the characters. You can also play 2-player fights, one against another on the same computer.</desc>

		<desc>A puzzle game loosely featuring licensing from the 7Up soft drink. The gameplay involves up to 4 players, which can be either human or computer, each taking on spots of a particular colour. Starting from opposite corners, they take it in turns to move, either by 'reproducing' one of their spots to form another one in an adjacent square, or by making a jump, losing the square you did have but taking one two spaces away. When a piece lands next to one of another colour, that piece changes colour into that of their opponent. The winner of each round is either the last player with any pieces left, or the player who has the most pieces left when the level is full.</desc>

		<name>Spy vs Spy III : Arctic Antics</name>
		<desc>With characters Taken from MAD Magazine, the Spy Vs. Spy series reached it's end in Arctic Antics. Spy vs Spy: Arctic Antics is an Action/Arcade game, for one or two players, developed by First Star Software and published by Wicked Soft. Released in the UK in 1989 for several contemporary platforms.

The duo, the White Spy (you) and the deadly Black Spy continue their battle. This time, the scrap takes place in the frozen Arctic, the objective: Find the essential components of a brand new rocket before you freeze to death! And more importantly, before your opponent -- the deadly Black Spy -- escapes his own fate or completes the mission instead! Your body temp. is effectively your health. You can get warmer by popping into an Igloo and standing by the fire for a few moments. Remember though! You've only a limited time to complete your mission, so don't dally!

Overall this game is quite fun, if lacking staying power, being the same thing over and over. It's main saving grace is the two-player option. Without it, the game just isn't as funny. I mainly played two-player and then ran through, completing, each difficulty. At higher difficulties it does present a challenge, but I don't think I'll be playing this game as often as others that are similar, due to the repetitive game-play and fiddly controls.</desc>

The black spy and the white spy are out to outsmart each other before the time bell rings. Find the needed objects (money, passport, secret plans and airport door key) by searching rooms in the embassy, which include desks, file cabinets and other furniture. Foil your opponent by setting creative booby traps in the various rooms (a bomb in a dresser drawer, for instance). Traps can be disarmed with objects found in rooms (a water bucket from a firebox on the wall will disarm the bomb in the prior example). When all the items are together in the secret briefcase, head for the airport door.</desc>

		<name>Stack Up</name>
		<desc>A good alternate title for this one would be Rows - not the kind you have when your wife finds lipstick on your shirt collar, but as an equivalent of Columns. The gameplay is essentially the same - groups of 3 variably-colored blocks fall towards the bottom of a 6x18 grid, and you must arrange them into groups of 3 of the same colour - except that the blocks are grouped horizontally rather than vertically.

Each individual brick falls as far as it can when you place the trio, so they won't necessarily all end up on the same line. Blocks fall as far as possible to fill gaps when lines are completed, so there are never gaps in the arrangement the way you get in Tetris. Each level sets you a target number of lines to form - 4 or 5 in a row count as 2 and 3 lines respectively for this calculation, a lá Klax. Horizontal lines score the least, with diagonals the most lucrative and vertical in between (this change from Columns makes sense considering the different building method).</desc>

		<desc>A horizontally-scrolling shoot 'em up from the last days of the basic 68000-powered Amiga. The levels are taller than the screen, so you can move up or down them and take on a selection of the different enemy waves each time.

At the start of the game you choose your primary and secondary weapon. Pressing fire briefly activates the primary; holding it down activates the secondary - therefore you can't use both at the same time. These can be powered up to various levels, and changed around by picking up tokens, although switching weapon or losing a life reduces your firepower initially. Continues and extra lives are on offer, as are a simultaneous 2-player mode, choice of sounds effects and/or music, and a music test menu.</desc>

However, you must fight an end-of-level bad guy once you have finished the 6th level of a world. While each level has the standard disintegrating rocks to destroy, all but 2 of them have extra bad guys, with a range of attack patterns.

There are a number of different weapons available, which are collected by moving your ship so that it crosses their paths as they float through space. Each of these can be powered up - some weapons start strong but can't be powered up as much as others; fortunately you can power up one weapon while using another. Extra lives, shield enhancements and a smart bomb are also on offer. 

Along with the standard levels, there are also 4 tunnel levels, which involve shooting what you can and dodging everything else as you dart through a ray-traced 3D tunnel, and 2 optional Thrust-style bonus levels in which lives can be won or lost.</desc>

		<desc>A long time ago, a great empire comprised of Humans, Velox, Thrynn and Elowan ruled the stars. The Empire's currency was an energy source called Endurium. But something happened and this empire is no more. Furthermore, the small colony world named Arth has forgotten this heritage and technology. 1000 years have since passed and the people of Arth have rediscovered archaeological evidence of their empire. Using these discoveries, they create spaceships and form the Interstel corporation to govern the fleet. It's time to take the first steps back into space... but could it be the same enemy that destroyed the Empire still exists?

Starflight is a space exploration game. The player must first form a crew, assign their positions and customize the spaceship before blasting off from spacedock. Once out into space, the standard interface allows access to different crew members and navigation. The entire galaxy is unknown and it's up to the player to travel to distant planets to explore and land on them. Using a top-down interface, a planetary lander will venture out with the task of  finding minerals and biological data to transport back to Starport. These resources can then be used to train crew members and improve the ship. Different alien races control the galaxy and it will be up to the player to engage them diplomatically or engage them in combat. Successful exploration of the galaxy and alien cultures will yield clues and new leads as to the fate of the Empire.</desc>

		<desc>The Planet Novenia has been attacked by the Egrons, who snuck in by disguising their craft as the protected Starglider species, which Novenia's automated defenses were programmed not to shoot. 

Your task is to fight them off using only an obsolete Airborne Ground Attack Vehicle. This was designed as the ultimate combat machine, with sophisticated hardware up to Draziw Yarg's high standards. It has a fully-rechargeable shield, plasma drive unit, an inbuilt scanner and 10,000-sector map, a top speed of 2550 Urads and two homing missiles.

The game is viewed from within AGAV's cockpit, with control over speed, weapon targeting and firing. There are several control options to decide exactly how the craft works, with fixed or floating sighting, and the option of automatic centering, allowing you to balance the game between easy sighting and advanced shooting ranges.

Repair depots must be visited frequently, as they can refill the weapon bays as well as repairing the ship. Crucially, the Egron Stargliders need 3 missiles to shoot down, so at least 1 visit to a depot is required to complete this job, at which point you move up to the next, harder, level.</desc>

Your family are Starlords of a single planet, but seek dominance of a vast space consisting of 1000 individually-ruled planets. If you are to come out on top you will have to manage resources across each of your starbases, using revenue to ensure enough fuel, food and minerals are available. Trade with other leaders and form tactical agreements.

To actually take over planets, you will have to lead your ships into space combat, which is played out in multiple-view 3D.</desc>

		<name>Star Trek - 25th Anniversary</name>
		<desc>Captain Kirk and the USS Enterprise are representatives of the United Federation of Planets. Their role in space is that of explorers as well as a military presence. The Enterprise routinely encounters strange adventures and bizarre situations, each laid out as a separate "episode" which must be played in order. The first episode involves the USS Enterprise being called to a world to investigate strange "demons" have appeared from the mines and begun attacking the settlers.

Star Trek: 25th Anniversary is based on the 1960s Star Trek TV series. The game is a combination of a point-and-click, side-scrolling adventure game and a first person starship simulator. This tie-in actually missed the 25th Anniversary of Star Trek's TV debut by half a year (nearly three years in the case of the Amiga version), but it uses the original series' characters and settings. Players directly control Captain Kirk, leader of the Starship Enterprise, and are able to give orders to other crew members. While the enterprise is on a peaceful mission, combat is possible. A new game begins on the bridge of the Enterprise, seen from a 3rd person view of Kirk, but a first person view out the viewscreen of the Enterprise. When on board the ship, Kirk can contact Chekov to assign a designation, raise shields or begin combat, contact Sulu to engage warp or adjust magnification, contact Spock to scan for data and search for keyword information, contact Uhura to deal with communications, and contact Scotty to change power allocation and repair damage and beam down to a planet. During combat, the player steers the Enterprise manually and is able to turn in 720 degrees of direction as well as increase or decrease speeds. Weaponry includes phaser banks which draw from the ship's energy and proton torpedoes which are in limited supply.

The adventuring bulk of the game comes in the form of many landing party missions, in which the player beams down to the surface of a planet and explores the situation. Kirk can move about on the screen, other crew members automatically follow him. From the menu, he chooses a body part to perform an action: eyes represent looking, mouth represents speaking, one hand represents using items (and crew members) while another is to pick up objects. Kirk carries an inventory of items collected which can be accessed and used at any time. In most missions Kirk will carry a communicator to contact the ship and a phaser weapon which can be set to "stun" or "kill", The poi</desc>

Collected extra symbols reward upgrades for the weapon and mostly for the means of transportation. The latter also serves as health bar: after each hit an upgrade level is lost.

To do this he must blow bubbles to catch the grubs that they feed on and guide them through the level by blowing on them or nudging them past any obstacles in the way to the nest where T'yungunz live.  To complete a level, you must make sure that a certain number of T'yungunz are fully fed so they go to sleep.  If they don't get enough food then eventually they die.

The levels are full of contraptions such as bellows, and obstacles such as spikes and fire that will burst the bubbles.  Some of these can be activated or deactivated using various switches.

Usually Steg navigates each level by walking on the floor, and also he can climb up the walls and even walk on the ceiling.  There are also devices he can contruct out of the parts from the Acme Bionic Bitz Catalogue, such as the Rocket Pack, and Bionic Legs, which allow different ways of getting around each level.</desc>

		<name>Stellar 7</name>
		<desc>In Stellar 7, a remake of the 1983 game, you drive the Raven, the most advanced Terran fighting vehicle. You are up against Gir Draxon and his evil Arcturan army. You will go from star system to star system, fighting his forces. When the enemies have been destroyed, a mothership flies overhead and beams down the Guardian of the star system, a giant enemy ship. When you reach the Arcturus star system, you will fight Gir Draxon!

The game is played from a first person view looking out from the cockpit of the Raven. It is in true polygonal 3D. Aside from a graphical and aural overhaul and the addition of cutscenes, the remake's gameplay and level design is virtually identical to the original, right down to the placement of each and every enemy. The major differences are the added "power modules" (e.g. supercannon, superjump) and a major boss creature at the end of every level.</desc>

		<name>BoBo - Stir Crazy</name>
		<desc>The game Bobo is an cartoon style arcade game.
The main character is Bobo - controlled by you - he is an inmate and has been sentenced for 17 years.
In this game inmate Bobo must do many chores, such as peeling potatoes, ladling soup to his fellow prisoners, helping his fellow prisoners to escape, jumping electric wires and singing lullabies to his snoring cell mates.

Besides playing all events it is possible to select and play just one event.
Up to six player can play this game by entering their names. They play alternating not simultaneously

Each event can be played by joystick or keyboard. The specific moves you have to make vary from event to event but it come basically down to moving the joystick or keyboard keys fast from left to right. To pick things up you have to move the joystick downwards (keyboard arrow key down). Tossing things is done by moving the joystick up (when using the keyboard you have to press cursor key up).

Below you 'll find a brief description of each event:

Bobo has a job in the prisons canteen. He must serve soup to the other inmates and keep their soup plates full. To do this Bobo must move around the tables. When his supply of soup is empty he must refill it at the top of the screen where a new supply of soup is available. If his fellow inmates demand more soup they  start banging and hammering on the tables. The score of this event is based on how many plates of soup he hands out.

Peeling potatoes is not Bobo's favorite chore but he has to do it. He has to pick up a potato, then peeling it and when that's done tossing it away. Bobo scores points based on the number of potatoes he has peeled. If a potato is not fully peeled it will be tossed back.

In the next event Bobo must help his inmates to escape prison. The inmates are jumping out of their cell windows and it is Bobo's task to get them over the prison wall by moving a trampoline around. 
The score is based on how many inmates actually can escape. Bobo must be sure to catch the inmates under the right angle with his trampoline because if he fails the inmates will crash into the prison wall.

Finally, Bobo found an way to escape prison. He must jump from wire to wire and as the wires are electrified he must take care not to be electrocuted. The score in this event based on how long Bobo can prevent being electrocuted. Bonus points can be earned by picking up the green objects that appear occasionally on the wires

In the last event Bobo has been captured by the poli</desc>

		<name>Stormball</name>
		<desc>Futuristic sports game roughly based on Pong. The idea is to hit the ball into the other half of the area (hopefully going over some point scoring blocks on the way) and hope that it bounces back off the far wall back into your hands (and so you can take another shot). That's of course while your opposition tries to catch the ball for themselves and score some points with it.

You have to pay to play someone and so you "gamble" your entry fee: Lose and you lose your money, win the match and you win more money. Eventually you have enough to challenge the sport's star players and win some big bucks!</desc>

		<name>Storm Master</name>
		<desc>Storm Master is a 1991 video game for the Amiga, Atari ST and PC, produced by the now-defunct French developer Silmarils, which placed the player as the head of government for a fictional semi-medieval country.

Similarly to most of the games produced by Silmarils, Storm Master took place on a European-fantasy world. Gameplay revolved around the governance and management of the country of Eolia in an ongoing war against its neighbour, Shaarkania, with the ultimate goal of sacking (and, by inference, destroying) all enemy cities.[1][2]

The game was notable for a blend of turn-based strategy interspersed with live-action battles. This took the form of aerial battles against enemy air fleets or air defences and required the player to launch ballistic missiles against enemy ships or batteries. Other real-time elements of the game involved the player conducting a religious ceremony with the goal of increasing the natural wind energy of the nation. This element of gameplay was further enhanced by requiring the player to dispatch government ministers around the country to develop or industrialise various aspects of the state. The game was further noted by Amiga Action as having an innovative 'advance through time' feature, allowing the player some control over the rate at which time passed in the game.</desc>

		<name>Stratego</name>
		<desc>The board game Stratego is a more elaborate version of Capture the Flag. Each player starts with 40 pieces; made up by the flag, 5 bombs, and an assortment of 9 types of military units. 

After these have been placed, each player takes it in turn to move their pieces. Other than scouts (which are the least powerful) the units can only move one space at a time.The flag and bombs can't be moved during the game, so watch out for any squares the computer does not move when it otherwise logically should, and these could be your goal.

When you choose a square occupied by an opposition piece, combat arises, and the higher-numbered piece is lost from the game. You have no way of knowing what strength the opposition pieces are until you have hit them. 

This computerized interpretation has 3 different board layouts, a selection of automatic setups with different strategic benefits, and a demo mode.</desc>

You're so hard, in fact, that you've decided to prove it to the rest of the world. The meanest, nastiest, vilest street fighters of five different nations have agreed to take you on in one of the dirtiest, most underhand, no-holds-barred street fighting contests in the universe ever.

If this is a top-quality beat 'em up then I'm a one-eyed Romanian greengrocer. Talk about easy - you don't even need to study the moves to be able to knock practically everyone out in under an minute. I got right through to the last toughie on my first go Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which doesn't exactly say much for the product's lastability. I can't say I was overly impressed by the graphics, the sound or the slow-motion gameplay Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in fact I can't say I was overly impressed by anything at all. Even the bonus section takes ages to react to your frantic pushing of the joystick Ã¢â‚¬â€œ by which time your energy bar has gone back down to minimum. If you're after a beat 'em up leave this one lying on the shelf.</desc>

		<name>Street Rod 2</name>
		<desc>SR2 is primarily a racing game, with an interesting premise. You buy and race Ã¢â‚¬Å“muscle carsÃ¢â‚¬Â in the 1960s. Except, these are not professional races. Instead, you challenge drivers at the local burger joint for illegal races down Mullholland drive.

I knew the magazine reviews had said quality was average, but still a decent game. It turned out to be much better than I thought it would be. Lots of emphasis is placed on upgrading your car. You have to spend your money wisely, and pick the best parts for the money. Once your car has been upgraded and modified, you drive it down to the local burger and fries joint. There, you will find a variety of other muscle cars, you can ask to look at their engine, and challenge them to a race. They may even challenge you to a race. Only drivers with cars similar or better will agree to a race. Naturally, as the game goes on, the races go for more money, and some challengers will only race for pink slips, and the game becomes serious. Obviously, losing a race at this level means the game is over.

Driving simulation part was terrible. It was slow, and the graphics were poor. It reminded me of running Ã¢â‚¬Å“test driveÃ¢â‚¬Â on an old 8086 PC. Overall, good concept. I find it strange that the Ã¢â‚¬Å“drivingÃ¢â‚¬Â section was so terrible. However, the Ã¢â‚¬Å“upgradeÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“challengeÃ¢â‚¬Â sections are well made, and easy to navigate and use. Not recommended unless you like working on cars.</desc>

		<name>Street Rod</name>
		<desc>Street Rod is a car racing game with a difference - and loads of atmosphere as well. It's set in the days when cars were really cars and milk bars were really milk bars. First you'll have to buy your car - look through the classified ads in the newspaper on the screen. Then get to work in the body-shop - maybe a new paint job in something tasteful like hot pink. Then it's out with the engine. A workshop screen lets you pull it to pieces, make timing adjustments and add high performance parts.

Then it's off to the race track. A cruise down the main street to show off your wheels will always result in a challenge - and usually there's a little wager on the side. The race sequences are difficult, and you only get one chance. Crash your car and it's back to the body repair shop. Not only that, your bank balance drops alarmingly. You can use joystick or mouse controls - I'm still not sure which I like best, but I suspect the joystick gives the best Ã¢â‚¬Å“feelÃ¢â‚¬Â.

Graphics are very nice, music is atmospheric - all in all, Street Rod is a hot game.</desc>

The gameplay is similar to the original, consisting of running, jumping and attacking, with a very dynamic central character. The laser gun can be used while standing still; moving attacks with the sword are still possible, with the two weapons combining similarly to the Switchblade games. Tokens can be collected, which will turn you into a robot to face the end-of-level enemies if enough are collected.</desc>

		<name>S.T.U.N. Runner</name>
		<desc>It's 2492 and you must pilot your Sub-Terranean Underground Network (S.T.U.N.) craft at speeds over 900 miles per hour through a series of courses to retain your title as S.T.U.N. Runner, completing each course before time runs out.

There are also enemies on each course, such as cycles, indestructible armored drones, and flying bird-like craft. Shoot or avoid them. If you hit them, you lose one of your shields (your craft has six total) and are slowed down temporarily. The more shields you have at the finish line, the more bonus points you get. Getting hit with no shields does not kill you, however. There are no lives in this game. The only way to lose is to fail to cross the finish line.

Along the way you'll encounter Boost Pads that temporarily speed you up to incredible speeds and make you indestructible. By running over enough green stars on each course, you can also earn Shockwaves, which destroy all enemies in your path.

Note that there is no accelerator in this game. Your craft always goes full speed, unless you hit something. Then you will slow down, but quickly accelerate back to full speed. Other than that, you cannot slow down and the only way to speed up is to run over a Boost Pad. Your only controls are steering left and right and aiming the gun on top of your craft up and down.</desc>

		<name>Subbuteo - The Computer Game</name>
		<desc>Subbuteo recreates the famous table football game, which makes for something very different from Sensible/Kick Off/FIFA style games. It's effectively a turn-based strategy game of sorts, as each player has 30 seconds to make their move (within a 30 minute match length), which involves first selecting a player, then aiming the direction in which he will be flicked, then the power and swerve of the flick are determined by the length of time the button is held down for. 

With any luck, your player will hit the ball, and hit it such that it doesn't leave the playing area, and doesn't hit an opponent. If any of those rules are violated, possession passes to the opposition. Before each flick, the team not in possession can make a 'defensive flick' involving moving one of their players into a potential blocking position (without hitting the ball or an opponent, as this is a foul).</desc>

		<name>Subtrade - Return to Irata</name>
		<desc>One of the best M.U.L.E. clones ever made, Subtrade: Return to Irata transfers the galactic capitalism of Dani Bunten's timeless classic to an undersea economy.

Despite new species, background graphics, and different commodities, gameplay is still M.U.L.E. at its heart: up to four players vie in a cutthroat competition to be the richest businessman in a futuristic economy. The different phases of M.U.L.E., e.g. land grant, production, and marketing, are preserved intact and are greatly enhanced by intuitive mouse-based interface and 16-bit graphics. The auction interface, which is the best part of M.U.L.E., is still as furious and fun as ever, with computer players that are aggressive enough to pose a real challenge. Unlike Linel's Traders, another M.U.L.E. clone, Subtrade does not introduce new gameplay options or the number of commodities.

Overall, Subtrade is definitely one of the best M.U.L.E. clones, if not THE best. M.U.L.E. fans will definitely enjoy this one, although the disappointing lack of tournament mode means that an average game with 4 players can be finished in less than 1-2 hours.</desc>

Loosely following the storyline of the film, Hogan alias intergalactic hero Shep Ramsey travels through space, crash-lands on earth and beats up the bad guys. The first level is a R-Type-like horizontal space shooter; destroy formations of drones and collect weapon upgrades. After that, you'll enter three platform levels, in which you have to find nine items each. Avoid being shot and dispatch the enemies with kicks and jumps. After each mission, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll encounter the level boss, who youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re supposed to beat up in a Street Fighter clone.</desc>

The triple jump involves pressing right to start the hop (before reaching the white line), right again for the step as you land, left as you land for the jump, and then up to propel you through the sand. I high jump, after selecting a height you feel you can clear, you use up and down to control the speed, fire to jump, and then forward to propel you over the bar.</desc>

As before, the racing is overhead view and against a field of 9 computer cars, with championship points awarded for finishing positions. The computer drivers now take on the humourous names from Lotus 1, such as 'Ayrton Sendup' and 'T Hairy Bootson'. The most noticeable addition is a split screen 2 player mode. 

The power ups have been changed around from the original, with the handling improvements gone, so as to put more of an emphasis on learning to control the slippery cars. These have been replaced by further weapons and more engine upgrades.

The questions from the original have been replaced by mock driving test questions about stopping distances and the like - as before, money and points are won and lost depending on your answers.</desc>

There are 9 tracks at each of the 4 difficulty levels, which can be raced in any order (although the last track you race is made harder than usual). In the races you win money, which can be spent on the usual handling and power upgrades, as well as forward-shooting missiles. You must finish in the top 3 of each race to progress - initially there are 4 computer opponents, but more are added as you progress through the game

You can upgrade your car throughout the game via the shop section. You are given an initial price, but also a number of options of things to say to the salesman – get the right combination and the price will drop.</desc>

The levels are populated with bats, trolls and snakes, which have programmed attack patterns and follow you off the screen. You can collect and cast up to 12 spells, which are accessed using the cursor or function keys (the manual amusingly refers to Amigas having F11 and F12 keys, which they don't). These include upgraded weapons (the default one isn't especially powerful), and help such as magic staircases and a metal melter. Some sections of water kill you, other identical ones take you to different sections.</desc>

		<path>./SuperC_v1.0a_Fast.lha</path>
		<name>Super C</name>
		<desc>Super C, a port of the classic 1988 Konami arcade game Super Contra.

Like in the original Contra, the game can be played by up to two players simultaneously. The left player controls Bill (who wears green in this installment), while the right player controls Lance (who wears purple). The game retains the side-scrolling format from the previous game, discarding only the pseudo-3D and fixed screen segments. Instead, Super Contra features vertically-scrolling stages played from an overhead perspective, in which the player can move in eight directions. The controls remain mostly the same during the side-scrolling segments, with the only difference is that the player can now control the height of his jump by holding the joystick upwards or downwards while pressing the jump button.

The player can replace their default gun with one of four possible weapons by destroying the flying item capsules that appear throughout each stage. The available weapons include a machine gun, a spread gun, a bomb gun and a laser gun. This time, weapons can now be upgraded by picking up the same power-up twice in a row, resulting in greater destructive power. The power-ups in Super Contra are represented by the actual guns the player's character wields instead of the Falcon-shaped letter icons from the previous game. During overhead stages, the player can also pick up a "hyper shell" item that destroys all on-screen enemies, which is launched by pressing the jump button. The hyper shell can be launched at any time during these stages and the player can store more than one at a time.

The game consists of five stages, which are set in a military base, a jungle and the alien's lair. Stages 1, 3 and 4 are played from the standard side-scrolling perspective, while Stages 2 and 5 employ the top-down perspective. Throughout each stage, the player must fight his way through the enemy's line of defense (including a few mid-bosses) until reaching the final target awaiting at the end.

After running out of lives, the player is allowed to continue up to five times before the game is entirely over; this depends on the DIP switch settings. Unlike the predecessor, each player can now continue at any time, with no need to wait until the other player runs out of lives.[2]</desc>

		<desc>If you have never heard of Jeff Minter, or "Attack of the Mutant Camels" then you have lived a sheltered life. Minter's games have a simple approach to things. You shoot them. The graphics in Super Grid Runner are simple, colourful and flash so brightly that any life form more advanced than humans (dolphins, mice and so on) may find that actual pain is induced. Sounds are similarly psychedelic and when amplified are almost, but not quite, totally unlike a Disaster Area concert. There are a large number of levels with which the earth creature may choose to begin the mindless destruction. These proceed with a definite lack of seriousness. Some might say they are fun. They would be right. They are indeed, as they say, fun.</desc>

		<desc>This is a conversion of Sega's popular motorcycle racing arcade game.  In this game you race a motorcycle around the world, completing each section of track within a time limit. There are other bikes on the road, but beating this is not important, so they can be thought of as moving obstacles. Each continent is a different difficulty level: Africa is beginner, Asia is junior, the Americas are senior, and Europe is expert.  

This is a very simple and straightforward game, viewed from behind the bike in 2D (so the screen does not tilt with the bike). The right/left controls are steering, and up/down are gear changes. Your cycle is always moving, and your speed strictly depends on the gear you are in, although contact or running off the road slows the bike down.</desc>

		<name>Superman - The Man of Steel</name>
		<desc>Superman comes on two discs and is split into several sub games, each more perilous than the last. As the game loads, a very agreeable rendition of the Superman theme plays in stereo harmony.

A nice, if somewhat pointless addition to the game is a mini comic strip which describes the storyline of the current mission. The first of these sees Superman battling Darkseid's Parra demons. Space Harrier style. Whether Superman selects heat vision or super-strength, you have to select the less than superhuman power of extreme patience to overcome the evil Parra demons. Once the first level has been completed the game becomes much more playable. As well as having to deal with Darkseid you must take on Lex Luthor, who has formed an alliance with Darkseid to destroy the earth.

Graphics are true to the comic, our hero being authentically recreated in pixels. Some of his flying is a shade rusty, but on the whole the game has been well implemented. The music and FX are top notch, especially the high score table which shows Superman's home at the North Pole. Overall, though, it lacks that special something.</desc>

The levels start with varying amounts of boulders, and as soon as you shoot at one of them, it breaks up into 2 more which are half the size. Eventually they become small enough that they disappear. 

Your character is a human sprite, so you’re bound to the ground unless you can jump onto one of the strategically-placed ledges. There are several different weapons available, which you don’t lose when you die.

There are numerous different control options – the standard one involves always firing in the direction you’re aiming, but others include one where your firing direction can be changed by flicking the joystick with fire held down, an option where you move using the main 4 directions and use the bottom-left and bottom-right diagonal to rotate the firing direction, and an option where you use one joystick for direction of movement, and the other for direction of fire.</desc>

		<desc>Across the Big Pond, Ivan 'Iron Man' Stewart is something of a celebrity in the world off off-road racing. King of the four wheel drive pick-up truck, Ivan has won more trophies and awards than you can shake a 4x4 at. His exploits saw Leland write a coin-op and now Graftgold have taken on the task of converting the Iron Man coin-op.

It's the start of the racing season and the four-by-four trucks are ready and raring to go, Iron Man is there and so are three other contestants revving up on the start line. With the flag going down, the trucks nitro away from the start line, bumping and bashing their way past each other up hill and down ditch. Coming first is recommended but the only requirement for staying in the championship is that you complete the fifth lap ahead of any other computer-controlled car (and that includes Iron Man Ivan himself).

Presentation of the game is really good: Three-player mode, attractive start-up screens, select a country option (complete with anthems). Multiload for each track but it's not excessive. Great attention to graphics detail in the relatively small trucks and their movement with plenty of frames of animation, great dirt shading and excellent detail in the extra effects. A jolly variety of suitably fast paced tunes (different one for each course) together with good samples. Separate country anthems, title and trophy screen tunes.

Overall, a highly playable Super Sprint variant, proving great fun with the multiplayers option, high quality graphics and excellent attention to detail.</desc>

The game uses a split-screen display, with a big window viewed from the side as well as a longer-range aerial view - the latter is useful for dodging hazards to the left or right, as the side-view doesn't demonstrate these accurately. The bike has 3 gears, and you must use a low gear to go uphill. You will need to do wheelies to ensure good landings from the big jumps, and to clear divots in the ground.</desc>

Player should avoid obstacles, stay on a route, and pass the gates in Slalom-like events; stay on the route in Bobsleigh, finish in first place with more style and jumps in Moguls, and jump good in Ski Jump.</desc>

		<name>Downhill Challenge</name>
		<desc>Downhill Challenge is a Sports game, developed by MicroÃƒÂ¯ds and published by BrÃƒÂ¸derbund Software, which was released in Europe in 1989.



An avalanche of unanswered questions buries Downhill Challenge before the skiier gets a third of the way down the hill. The game attempts to simulate slalom skiing, downhill skiing, giant slalom skiing, and ski jumping.



You had better know the rules of these Nordic events already, because the skimpy manual is little help. I was left wondering: How does the program keep time in the downhill events? What do the splits mean and where are they taken? What is the penalty for missing a gate? How many times do you go downhill in the competition mode (thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also one for practice) before you can move on to the next event? Besides pressing the Shift key or joystick button for extra height, how do you control the skiier while jumping?



At least you have above average graphics to look at while you ponder. The scenery you ski toward but never quite reach is nearly breathtaking. The viewpoint of the game is from about 15 feet behind the skiier. The game would come alive much better if it actually put you up on the skis with perhaps only your poles showing in each hand, and if it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sound as if you have a motor attached to your back after the starting bell.</desc>

		<name>Superstar Ice Hockey</name>
		<desc>Side view hockey game. Gameplay allows for players to choose from either the centre or goalie positions, a 2 player option allows for head to head play or co-operative play where one player is the centre and the other the goalie. Coaching decisions such as line changes and strategy choices can be made during a game between whistles. Player creation, development and trades all take place before and after games.

Gameplay as a centre was limited due to only having one action button, this meant that when playing as a centre, pressing the "fire" button would cause the player to swing his stick. If the player had possession of the puck this would result in a shot. Swinging the stick with or without the puck also had the potential to knock other players down depending on their proximity to the swinging stick, often resulting in a penalty, if no penalty is called the player knocked down would spin for several seconds before getting back up (if you as the centre were knocked down you were effectively out of the play until you regained your feet).

The game was notable for its player creation and development system, the game used "trade points" as a measure of value when creating new players, trading players and running team practices. The more points spent on an activity, in general the better the result. Players also aged and their skills declined, the most noticeable being speed.</desc>

		<name>Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers</name>
		<desc>Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers for A1200 AGA machine is little less ugly and faster and is the best Amiga Street Fighter so far! You would be forgiven for thinking this is some dodgy shareware copyright infringing knock off, yet it is a fully licensed and US Gold backed game!

To be honest AGA version looks better than the A500 but not much. The backgrounds look poorly drawn lacking any animation with colour pallets that look like they date back to the late 80's, while the fighters have shrunk dramatically lacking detail and character, but for everything it lacks in visual fidelity it makes up in speed and smoothness. A1200 version is treated to some enhanced visuals such as overlayed power bars, but also you will hit the holy grail of 50fps which will have you forgiving the game for being so ugly! Up the turbo speed, throw it into NTSC mode and hold on tight!

Sound is present and accounted for giving music and SFX at the same time, and while nothing brilliant it manages to preserve the arcade feel. Increased speed means the game play is right up there with the arcade version resulting in some frantic rounds.

No game's worth this amount of disk accessing. The game's fast flowing, punchy and varied, but let down by terrible sound, minute graphics and terrible, TERRIBLE disk accessing. You'd have to be a big fan to forgive all its problems.</desc>

		<name>Super Tetris</name>
		<desc>Discover the mystery of the four squares in TETRIS?. This game of skill was conceived by two Soviet programmers. Time is of the essence as you try to rotate and/or flip moving pieces to fit as they descend from the top of the screen. Make the pieces fit precisely with the others to form a compelte row with no blank spaces. The quicker you position each piece and allow it to drop into place, the better your score.
As complete rows are formed they automatically disappear from the screen. When ten rows have been successfully removed, you advance to a high level and the pieces descend faster. Therefore the further you get, the more challenging TETRIS? becomes.</desc>

		<name>Supremacy : Your Will Be Done</name>
		<desc>Supremacy: Your Will Be Done, released as Overlord in the US, is a strategy video game designed by David Perry &amp; Nick Bruty and produced by Probe Software.

The goal of Supremacy is to create and protect a network of planetary colonies and defeat a computer adversary who is trying to do the same. There are four skill levels, each represented by an enemy race, and each featuring a progressively stronger opponent. The more advanced a system is, the more freedom a player has when purchasing spacecraft. Higher skill levels also result in different numbers of planets in each system.

The game was initially released for the Amiga and Atari ST computers in the beginning of 1990.</desc>

Your ultimate goal is defeating the evil Colonel Chi who threatens your island, and the game leads you from California all the way to the South China Sea.

In the game, you can move left or right through several scrolling screens that constitute one level. One button is used to fight the randomly spawning ninjas in beat 'em up fashion, while another one can be used to enter buildings. The player has an inventory that can hold only one item at a time. These items are used to solve some small puzzles within each stage.</desc>

This time though he's bitten off more than he can chew - his cargo is alive (genetically speaking), dangerous and sought after by a rival company who'll stop at nothing to cripple his dodgy tramp freighter and take over the job.

An interactive adventure game set in the grand cyberpunk tradition with stunning action sequences, excellent animated location graphics, and a warped sense of humor thrown in for good measure.</desc>

		<desc>In this puzzle board game you should swap the tiles to make the sequence of tiles of the same color to eliminate them.
Shape of tiles varies from big and small squares to triangles or hexagons. If tiles have no neighbor tiles you may take appropriate tiles from the pocket of the limited size to eliminate the rest of the tiles. Finishing the level, player will be transferred to the higher level if the results of the current level were high enough for such level. But to finish level successfully, player should acquire the certain number of points and to be qualified for the next level. The difficulty also raises and depends on quantity of colours, the shape of the tiles, and time limit presence. Undo moves are also present, but such moves decrease your final results. Game may be saved in progress and loaded later. 

Best scores and levels will be written in High Score Table.</desc>

		<desc>As Hiro, you must once again defeat the ninja lord Havok. Using ninja throwing stars and other weapons, you must defeat the minions of Havok to reach him.

Switchblade II is a side-scrolling platform action game. One key aspect of the game is obtaining coins from defeated enemies, which can be traded at shops for extra lives, energy, and weapons.

A sequel to Switchblade, Switchblade II is an action-platformer. The action is viewed from the side. The player guides the protagonist, Hiro, through six levels infested with mechanoid, metal-clad enemies. Weapons include a knife, homing missiles, a laser beam, a flame thrower and shuriken.

Although the game was developed in the UK, its graphics had a distinctly Japanese style, similar to manga.</desc>

		<desc>The Fireblade, sacred symbol of the ancient Switchblade clan, has been smashed into 16 pieces by the evil Havoc - but they say that a Hiro can save it, and as Hiro, you must retrieve the 16 pieces and restore your people's pride.

The gameplay is platform and ladders based, set both inside and outside. The layout of the territories becomes visible as you progress, and they can contain bonus weapons and secret rooms. Unlike the sequel you start without weaponry, and this is gained directly, rather than you collecting coins and trading them at shop sections. Holding down fire progressively builds up your fighting power.</desc>

There are 11 levels to take on, with indoor and outdoor settings. Your character has a range of sword-slashing and jumping moves, which must be used to their full effect if you are to make progress.

		<desc>In the future, the world is controlled by a handful of global corporations (syndicates).  You are the Marketing director (hit man) for one of these companies.  It is your job to take control away from the competitors.  The job is not one of diplomacy, but one of brute force and physical control.  Advance your way to the top of the corporation by successfully completing your missions and managing the money you make from your territories.

The gameplay is visually reminiscent of X-Com, with an angled top-down perspective, but it is real time rather than turn based. You have missions ranging from infiltrate and capture, to seek and destroy. In each of these you direct a team of four agents as they move through the world shooting at anything that gets in their way.

You can upgrade and modify your agents, as well as equip them with tools you have researched or liberated from opposing syndicates.  As you complete missions, you gain more funds to use for purchasing agents or researching upgrades and equipment.</desc>

Score the necessary amount and you are let loose in the armoury.

Take 'em Out is a respectable game, good fun to play with a laughably large amount of gore. Then you finish the third level, and you get the 'Congratulations you have completed your missionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ screen! If it was not for the lack of levels, Take 'em Out could be a substantially superior game to what it now is.

Spit in my eye, eh? Isn't the world a small place guv'nor? Well, yeah, it is a small place and that is why T'ngl-y-wd isn't on it Ã¢â‚¬â€œ actually. It's a 'small undistinguished planet in a remote galaxy'. Arthur didn't worry about it much until he found out that it contained some pretty valuable stones, then he shot his mouth off over a couple of pints of beer and was elbowed out by the mining company. Yup, those nice men at the mining centre have hidden Arthur's documents and re-established the planet's operational base. There's a court case in ten days and Arthur (sounds a bit like my uncle, Ripperbile) needs to find those papers or he's out on his ear.

This is definitely an arcade-style adventure weighted towards the arcade. You might find the puzzles pretty devious, but it's all a question of having the right thing at the right time. If you like your adventures grilled and ready to eat you probably won't find Tanglewood instantly appealing. You could spend ages exploring this deep and mysterious world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ there must be some juicy titbits somewhere Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but it takes so long to get anywhere that you might decide to throw your disk over the nearest bridge and cut your toenails instead. But watch out Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you might start enjoying yourself!</desc>

		<desc>For around 4000 years the Chinese have been enthralled by this puzzle concept. It consists of a set of 7 shapes, representing squares, triangles and trapezoids, which must be arranged to form a pre-defined pattern. In this version there are 200, representing things such as animals and buildings.

The shapes are on the right of the screen, and you move the mouse cursor over one to select it, then place it onto the shape as required. They can be rotated using the right mouse button. 

All this is done against a time limit. As well as points for clearing a level, you get bonus time for completing them with time to spare. This bonus time can then be used on later levels if you run out of the allotted time. Once you have no bonus time, you can dig into your main score to provide more time.

There are two difficulty levels - the Novice level sees time elapse half as quickly as the Expert mode, and presents the levels in an approximate order of difficulty, whereas in Expert mode they are in randomised order.</desc>

		<desc>Your grandfather has invented a device which makes real everything he can see in his dream. All the strange places and creatures he can dream about really exist in an alternate reality. One of those creatures, named Franklin Snarl, traveled through the device to our reality and kidnapped Gramps, teleporting him into the crazy world of Tonetown. He hopes that Gramps will always remain asleep, which assures Snarl's own existence!

Now it's up to you, the hero of the game to travel to the alternate dimension of Tonetown and to rescue your grandfather. You interact with the environment by either typing in commands, or choosing one of the action icons available as interface. The game, therefore, combines text-based interaction with the more modern "point and click" approach.</desc>

Their job is to destroy the swarms of aliens – including flying saucers, tie fighters, space jellyfish, unidentifiable blobs, and the like – and dodge their fire. This can be achieved by shooting them with the standard zapper or use a smart missile to destroy everything in sight. 

When an entire swarm is destroyed, getting the token that appears give the player a roving sight, sideways-firing missiles, extra lives, extra missiles, and so on. Between each swarm, a meteor shower appears, and players need to avoid being hit.

Contact with other bikes or the scenery gradually increases the damage percentage, which will eliminate you at 100%. Crashing results in an external replay of your final moments.

Joystick and mouse control options exist, with the mouse being ultimately faster but harder to learn. 125, 250 and 500cc options exist, with the difficulty higher on the more powerful bikes. You can contest a full season, single race, or simply practice on a free track. 

16 circuits are featured, from Suzuka and Misano to Rijeka and Philip Island, with races over 5-50 laps. Your opponents are seven factory Suzuki riders from various classes at the time, including 1993 500cc World Champion Kevin Schwantz.</desc>

		<name>Tearaway Thomas</name>
		<desc>You control Thomas, a strange-looking but vaguely cutesy animal of some description in an ultra-fast platform game. There are 50 levels, split into 5 groups of 10.

Each one has a certain number of gems, and your task is to collect a certain number of them (for example, level 2 has 55 and you need at least 40) and then find the exit, all within the time limits. The yellow gems are worth 50 points and the purple ones 100, although the purple ones donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t appear to be more precariously-placed, and the total makes no distinction, so this is for colour as much as anything. Once youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve got the required amount, the gems double in value, tempting you to continue to explore

The levels are infested with cutesy-looking baddies, such as birds and bears, which canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be killed, and must be avoided, as contact with them costs you time as Thomas picks himself up. You can jump on the heads of some of them, which gives a small points bonuses. The layouts include ropes to ascend, moving platforms and more. Some levels are entirely vertically-scrolling, seeing you progress up the ledges of a tree or similar.

If you run out of time you lose a life, but the level isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t reset, so you keep the number of gems collected and have a fresh set of time. This means that you are far less likely to lose a second life on the level, similarly to Chase HQ.</desc>

		<name>Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles - The Coin-Op!</name>
		<desc>The game, surprisingly enough, is a horizontally scrolling beatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢em-up affair. Not very innovative I know, yet itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a tried and tested theme that proves very popular with younger people. Personally, I wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t touch the coin-op, or any other tedious beatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢em-up for that matter, with a barge pole.

The game begins from a small selection screen. That is, either one or two players can choose which particular Turtle character theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d most like to take control of.  A short and tacky intro sequence follows and then the fun really begins. The main aim of the game is to rescue April OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Neil, a top TV news reporter in New York. It just so happens that the evil Foot Clan who kidnapped her in the original game, have repeated this outrageous crime. Our heroes must battle their way through hoards of adversaries using their weapon and of course, a number of bread and butter Turtle actions. Each move is joystick controlled. As the levels progress, the baddies begin to carry weapons and throw lethal objects in the general direction of the Turtles.

This game consists of little more than moving your character into position and endlessly pressing the fire button. In conversion terms this is also very poor. The graphics bear little resemblance to their crisply defined arcade counterparts, and the sound is simply awful when compared to the likes of First Samurai.</desc>

&gt;who's been captured by SHREDDER - a maniac more menacing than an army of 
&gt;mind altered Bruce Lees.
  
&gt;But if they're to succeed, you must command the role of each turtle 
&gt;(one at a time, of course), rumbling through six New York territories 
&gt;patrolled by Ninjitsu Warriors, blood descendants of the deadly Foot 
&gt;Clan.
  
&gt;Along the way, you'll encounter Mouser infested sewers, criminally 
&gt;polluted rivers and villainous streets run by the terrorist team of 
&gt;Bebop and Rocksteady.
  
&gt;To overcome these inhumane hazards, utilize your reptilian brain and 
&gt;map out strategies that will help you locate secret sewage passages. 
&gt;Also be sure to alternate your turtle identity throughout the mission, 
&gt;matching each turtle's strengths with those of the ever changing enemy.
















&gt;So grab your nunchukus and prepare to put yourself in someone else's 
&gt;shell. Because in this to-the-death adventure, you'll control every 
&gt;leap, chop, slice and dice, until you knock heads with Shredder and 
&gt;either splatter him senseless or get yourself turned into turtle soup.

***Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles***, originally released as Fierce Turtle 
Ninja Legend in Japan and later as Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles in Europe,
is a 1989 platform game for the Famicom/NES. The game was released in 
Japan through Konami themselves, then in North America through Konami's 
Ultra Games imprint, followed by a release through the European equivalent
, Palcom Software, in PAL regions.
















This was the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video game, and is based 
on the 1987 TV series, which was in its third season at the time of the 
game's original release, although the art style more resembles the 
original TMNT comic series.
















The game was ported to various home computer platforms in 1990, including
the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and Amiga. The DOS version is
infamous, as it contains a gap that is impossible to cross without 
cheating.

		<name>Temple of Apshai Trilogy</name>
		<desc>The Temple of Apshai followed the general idea of Dungeons and Dragons, with lots of monsters to meet in battle and treasure to be found.

You can start from scratch, with your character given a random 1 to 18 for six basic attributes: Intelligence, intuition, ego, strength, constitution and dexterity, together with a number of silver pieces. You can enter a previously saved character from disc. Thankfully this interpretation has superior graphics attributes of a character from an earlier game. You can restore a previous game saved at any point within Apshai.

Each realm has four levels. Dungeons and Dragons followers will find levels 1 to 2 are appropriate to third level, and the lower levels to fourth and sixth level characters. There are special commands, such as examining a wall for secret doors, opening doors, searching for traps, picking up treasures, listening for monsters, talking to monsters, healing with salves or elixirs, checking the and a few healing salves, you are inventory of your treasures or saving the game or character for future use. Most levels of each realm have 50 to 60 rooms, so there is plenty to explore. Some monsters are tied to particular locations, but others wander around looking for the odd meal. The innkeeper will pay you for any treasure you have collected so you have a chance to add to or improve your equipment.

There is a little more to Apshai than straightforward monster bashing, but nowhere near the depth of puzzles and quests to be found in more modern offerings such as Ultima and Bard's Tale.</desc>

		<name>T2 : The Arcade Game</name>
		<desc>The story is that a terminator sent from the future to kill the leader of the resistance, Sarah Connor, failed miserably and now the enemy is targeting the future leader, Sarah's son John. But young John has a guardian angel (you) and your job is to protect him from the said evil.

Using a point-of-view perspective, you target a gunsight at a host of baddies and blow them to smithereens. These include Endoskeletons with rifles, machinegun-toting Cyborgs, acid-chucking laboratory technicians and various devilsome airborne craft. You start with a machine gun and 25 guided missiles, which are best used sparingly. Along the way, there are a whole host of pick-ups to gather including extra credits, protective shields, and a plethora of destructive firepower. They appear in kit cases and you must click to open them and click again to obtain them. It is seriously fast action. There are seven levels to tackle including a van chase where you battle against a T-1000 in a helicopter. This is a faithful conversion of the arcade game and the graphics and sound effects remain true to the original with sampled speech and crisp explosions and gunfire.

Although Terminator 2 does not break new ground or offer a great deal of variety, it is perfectly adequate in the playability stakes. In two-player mode, it is fast, furious and fun. The sheer volume of baddies make it virtually impossible for one player to take them all out, but with two you can dispose of them at will as well as collecting the plentiful pick-ups. As the man himself once said, "I'll be back". But not until next Tuesday.</desc>

		<desc>This multi-level action/adventure takes players back 40 years to find Professor K.K. Renegade, who predicts that a catastrophic asteroid is heading straight for earth.

Select one of the five most intrepid Adventurers from England, France, Germany, Japan, and the U.S. to spearhead the search. Professor Renegade was last seen in the unexplored region of the highest Tibetan ranges; an area populated by creatures and conditions of the professor's own design: venomous stone snakes, reptilian birds, and acid storms. Not only must your Adventurer survive these tests of courage, but he must and properly use such curious objects as spurs, a vacuum cleaner, and a unicycle. Once you locate the professor and convince him to help, you'll need to help him construct an anti-asteroid deflector to prevent the destruction of earth.</desc>

		<desc>Just because a region is bleak, desolate and inhospitable doesn't mean it lacks value. The planet Colian is a case in point; it has plentiful stocks of tough metal Aluma, the explosive Detonite, and the energy giving Quaza crystals. The units which are mining them are under the control of the Empire, and are forced to produce destructive Terrorpod units.

The rival Federation attempts to shut this operation down, and sends you to the surface in a Defence Strategy Vehicle. Your task is to find each of the six bases before the Empire can destroy evidence of them. Destroy all the Terrorpods in order to reach the bases.

The action is viewed from your DSV, as you move and shoot at any encroaching Terrorpods. Colian has a heavy inertia field, so you are always moving. You have guided missiles at your disposal, although these use up some of your limited Detonite stocks. Missiles will also be aimed at you; avoid these.

As all this action unfolds, you are trying to ensure that enough components can be produced in the mines, and can be retrieved in order to go towards the Federation's own building efforts. Collect the resultant products to attach them to your DSV.</desc>

		<desc>The First Galactic Games are about to start. Athletes, unsurpassed from each World, assemble in the arena for a superlative display of gamesmanship. Flags whirl high above the stadium while the crowd roars in anticipation.
PHOEBUS, the sun God, smiles as he prepares to ignite the olympic flame. Then....A messenger, panting, desperately climbs the ancient stairs. PHOEBUS pauses, waiting for the bearer of bad tidings to approach.
The legendary 6 PHOENIX TABLETS without which the games cannot start, have been stolen. A jealous act of vengeance by the TETROIDS who were not invited to compete.
The TETROIDS have a challenge of their own. They have split each PHOENIX TABLET into 64 pieces and cunningly hidden each one in the six provinces of their world.
PHOEBUS lowers his head. A millenium ago, as a young Demi-God, he battled in TETRADOME. He remembers each section of every quadrant; each quadrant in every tablet that make up the 384 sections, he remembers the SPITTERS, those dreaded pits which generate the deadly ALIENS from the very heart of TETRADOME; the ACID and OIL slicks, the MUTATING DEFLECTORS, THE fiendish JOYSTICKS which...
He also remembers how the TETROIDS, with their impish sporting instinct, devised obstacles that could be twisted into advantages.
With bated breath, the crowd awaits as PHOEBUS delivers the challenge.
"I will Bestow my POWER on whoever makes the TETRAQUEST. Who becomes the TETRAQUESTRIAN and accepts this CHALLENGE must know no trepidation, must dive and swoop and dodge like the Mighty PHOENIX. Indeed, HE will actually have the POWER to become a PHOENIX and soar above that fiendish four-ply world. USE THE POWER WISELY. Remember always, TETRADOME has many SECTIONS and you must conserve your STRENGTH.
Now. Who will rise from the ashes of these, my GAMES, and bring to me the PHOENIX MEDALLIONS???"
For a moment YOU are blinded by a flash from his Golden eyes. Then you walk towards him.........
LET THE GAMES BEGIN!!</desc>

		<name>Tetris Pro</name>
		<desc>The basic Tetris gameplay, involving arranging each shape as you are given them to create complete lines, and then adjust to the remaining fragments falling down a line and perhaps blocking off lower lines, was reinvented in this title. The game is split into levels, and each one requires a set number of lines to be completed. As you do so, you gradually reveal a cartoony picture, varying from semi-naked girls to candles.

The levels usually have some amount of blocks already in place, which must be worked around, and often specify that picture lines are only awarded when you score 2 or more lines at a time. There are also power-ups, which come in some of the square blocks and are activated if you use them to complete a line. They include points bonuses, bombs to remove some of the existing tiles, and some Ã¢â‚¬Ëœpower-downsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, such as one which turns the screen upside down, and one that removes the preview of the piece.</desc>

Geometric shapes fall from the top of a playfield to rest on the bottom; fit the pieces together, and the line they form disappears.  If the pieces don't form lines and eventually stack up to the top of the playfield, the game is over.  Difficulty increases by dropping the pieces faster and faster over time.

Tetris is a verifiable classic game, translated to well over 200 electronic and computer platforms.  It takes 2 minutes to learn, but a lifetime to master.</desc>

		<desc>You can keep your Retaliators and keep your supersonic high altitude bombers. What you really want are good ol' Spitfires and Messerschmitts to go dogfighting in Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or so Lucasfilm will have us believe in their follow up to the great Battlehawks 1942. Anyone with even a basic knowledge of recent British history will recognise the immortal words used in the title, so it is no shock to find out that this game is a combat flight sim based on aircraft that were around in the first half of the Second World War.

First of all, you can decide which side to fight for, but remember the decision here limits which craft are available to fly Ã¢â‚¬â€œ no Spitfires in the Luftwaffe! The Brits have got Hurricanes and Spits to fight in while the German have not only fighters, but medium and long range bombers and dive bombers. Each plane has several missions set aside for it that can be played in any order. The missions are varied and range from straight dogfights to scramble and intercept missions. Once a mission is completed the combat records are updated and stored to disk.

Then there are the campaign games if you feel like playing for a long while, where you take charge of your side's airforce and try to either bomb the blazes out of blighty or not, depending which side you are on.</desc>

		<desc>Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog. The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.

Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.

You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.

It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.</desc>

You start off in your apartment, which contains a computer, bugging equipment and an answerphone, as well as useful items such as money and a passport. A compass on screen is used to move around, with symbols appearing on the left and right of the status screen to indicate when something important is to the west or east of you. 

You will have to explore the city streets, with the aid of taxis and the Autobahn. Talk to important people and buy key objects, and then sneak around spying on anyone who seems suspicious. Encounters with enemy agents, muggers and tramps can turn violent; when they do, use your gun quickly to ensure they are shot first.</desc>

		<name>Thomas The Tank Engine And Friends - Pinball</name>
		<desc>I have got a problem with computer pinball games. Football, golf, cricket and darts. I have played and enjoyed on the Amiga Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but pinball? Nah. If you have got a pound in your pocket and are in the centre of a large town, you will be surrounded by all manner of real silver ball opportunities in arcades and pubs.

Now I will readily admit that if you are three years old (Thomas is aimed at age three upwards), you are unlikely to find yourself with a pound in your pocket in the centre of a large town with time to kill. If you do, you are lost, or your parents have abandoned you. Find a policeman immediately.

There are four tables (Thomas, Percy, James and Toby), multi-player options and it all works reasonably well Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the ball rolls towards the flippers, you hit it and it bounces around the table until it goes out. Some of the shots are very difficult, and some are virtually impossible, but that is not different to other 'adult' tables. It all scrolls reasonably well, it is bright and colourful (kids are bound to like it) and, well, it is a perfectly functional kids' pinball game. Buy it if you want a reasonable kids' pinball game for your Amiga.

However, there is an alternative. Have you thought about investing in a sturdy box or crate? If you do, you can visit your local, child-friendly pub, put Ã‚Â£1 in the pinball machine, place the child on the sturdy box or crate facing the table, repair to the bar and leave your offspring playing the real thing and annoying everyone within a 10-yard radius.</desc>

		<desc>International Rescue is made up of George Tracy, Brains Hackenback, and Tracy's five sons, each of whom has a Thunderbird craft of their own. They have four missions to complete in turn.

Each of these involves a two-man squad, whom you can switch between at any time. Each must select the correct objects to bring beforehand. You will have to move through the screens via lifts and ladders, avoid hazards and solve puzzles.

Mission one is set in a mine shaft, which is rapidly flooding and has two miners trapped. Next up is a nuclear submarine stranded after hitting a mine, which must be repaired and reactivated before it explodes. During this mission, you discover evidence of the miner's construction, so must break into a bank to steal the appropriate documents. This reveals that a madman is holding International Rescue to ransom, so you must finally travel to his lair to stop him.</desc>

The game features 12 levels split into three distinct styles. First of all you'll be flying over a city in your helicopter, shooting out tanks by ducking low enough to target them, but also climbing to avoid the skyscrapers in the area. The third section is viewed similarly, but sees you attempting to wipe out the planes mounted on an aircraft carrier.

The second section is viewed behind your helicopter in full 3D, and adds helicopters and planes to be shot, with dodging their bullets as you duck down to shoot the tanks being the main challenge.</desc>

		<desc>Thunderstrike is a 3d spaceship shooter set in the year 2238, using a non-textured polygon graphics engine. As a pilot in the "Ground Defense Games", you must make your way through several arenas built on different planets. You can choose from four different ships, each with different properties (better/worse acceleration, top speed, or turning speed).

When you enter the arena, you are given several pyramids that you must defend from robotic drones sent out to collapse them. In addition to defending your pyramids, you must destroy the spawning centers that spawn not only drones, but an array of robotic fighters to hunt you down.

When you destroy a fighter, sometimes it will leave behind an upgrade pod (shield, turbo, power, or twin-fire). There are also tracks that you can latch your ship onto to travel the perimeter of the arena quickly.

At the end of each round, your performance is reviewed, and if you did good, your ship is upgraded and you move on to the next round.</desc>

		<path>./TimeBandit_v1.0.lha</path>
		<name>Time Bandit</name>
		<desc>Time Bandit is a Gauntlet-style arcade game with text adventure elements.

Having nothing to do with the Terry Gilliam movie Time Bandits, this game utilises the time-travel theme for a fast-paced preview of the concept getting famous with Gauntlet two years later. Your bandit visits 16 different worlds throughout time to grab as much loot as possible and, in the long run, do some universe-saving stuff as well.

Each of the 16 locations -- featuring such varied places like a medieval arena, a bomb factory, a wrecked spaceship and a ghost town -- is basically a labyrinth filled with treasure and -- you guessed it -- monsters. You've got to dodge these or blast them with your weapon, while collecting keys, opening doors and searching for the exit. Although theoretically each location consists of 16 sub-levels, these are merely the basic layout flipped or mirrored, some items redistributed and the monster speed increased. After completing a level, you return to the world map, where you may freely choose the next challenge (nice) and save your game (very nice).

Interestingly, Time Bandit tries to spice up the fast arcade action with text adventure scenes. Due to this strange mixture, you will occasionally bump into persons or computer consoles with which interaction is possible. For example, you've got to explore and repair the damaged spaceship Excalibur. However, the parser is crude at best; you'll have to know exactly what to do, or else you will trigger no reaction.

Gaming veterans will discover a score of elements of and allusions to arcade classics, such as Tutankham, Pac-Man, Centipede, Bomberman, and others.</desc>

		<desc>In Time Machine, the player takes control over Professor Potts whose main profession is building time machines. As terrorists bomb his laboratory, he gets sucked ten million years into the past. During the course of his adventure he will visit five time zones with five screens each.

This is an adventure with action elements. Most of the game is spent manipulating objects in the different time zones which have an effect on a later zone, e.g. planting a seed in the stone age will cause a tree to appear in the later zones. He also may need to bring an object from one time to another. In each zone there is one big puzzle to solve in order to get access to the next zone (the ultimate goal is to prevent the time machine from getting destroyed), but constant traveling between the time zones is necessary.

The professor has a limited amount of mini time machines in his pocket which can be placed on a screen for travelling purposes. However, the usage of them is not limited. The action elements of the game consist of enemies which try to hurt the professor. Those can be disposed of by firing an (automatically recharging) electrical discharge. While those action elements are always present, the focus lies on the puzzle solving.</desc>

		<desc>The game is a strategical puzzle action, where you have to eliminate the playfield filling it with the tiles of different colors until the time will be exhausted. Each playfield represents a certain period of the human evolution such as Prehistory, Crusades, Prohibition or Berlin Wall. On each level some animation takes place, and you should perform your goal until it logically finishes. 

The tiles are triangles of different colors, sometimes combined in groups, appear in one corner of the playfield and should be put in another place based on the player's strategy in the way to do not block the path for other tiles. When four triangle tiles with adjacent tiles of different colors formed a square, this square will be eliminated from playfield with its part and no tiles may be placed or moved here. Adjacent tiles of the same colors will be eliminated from playfield, but playfield will remain untouched. Tiles may be moved on the playfield and rotated over the center of the square. Also playfield may include different obstacles, which may influence on moving/rotation of your tiles to make it more difficult, and they should be avoided in any possible way.

Finishing the level will give you the code, which may be used later to access this level. There are 30 levels available to play.</desc>

Simulman, the protagonist of a similar series, also appeared in an episode of this. The protagonist of the series is Max, a boy who, in the first episode of the series, gives Jessica (his girlfriend) a ring with a strange red stone. A ray of light starts from the stone, opening a portal from which two blue robots emerge, stealing the ring and kidnapping Jessica. Max reaches a friend of his, Lucas, and informs him of the situation. Lucas explains that, while testing a time machine he invented, the stone of the ring produced interference. Max uses the time machine (a scooter capable of opening temporal portals) and reaches prehistory. There he meets Bounty Killer (wearing a superhero costume) and Jack Stone (dressed in hat and raincoat like the detective of the 30s), characters who call themselves "sentinels of time" and give him various advice. Moreover, always in prehistoric times, it finds a futuristic base controlled by the same blue robots (called Skunks) where it discovers that, to travel in time, they use red stones (called "spatial stones") similar to the one on the ring.</desc>

Max reaches a friend of his, Lucas, and informs him of the situation. Lucas explains that, while testing a time machine he invented, the stone of the ring produced interference. Max uses the time machine (a scooter capable of opening temporal portals) and reaches prehistory. There he meets Bounty Killer (wearing a superhero costume) and Jack Stone (dressed in hat and raincoat like the detective of the 30s), characters who call themselves "sentinels of time" and give him various advice. Moreover, always in prehistoric times, it finds a futuristic base controlled by the same blue robots (called Skunks) where it discovers that, to travel in time, they use red stones (called "spatial stones") similar to the one on the ring.</desc>

Simulman, the protagonist of a similar series, also appeared in an episode of this. The protagonist of the series is Max, a boy who, in the first episode of the series, gives Jessica (his girlfriend) a ring with a strange red stone. A ray of light starts from the stone, opening a portal from which two blue robots emerge, stealing the ring and kidnapping Jessica. Max reaches a friend of his, Lucas, and informs him of the situation. Lucas explains that, while testing a time machine he invented, the stone of the ring produced interference. Max uses the time machine (a scooter capable of opening temporal portals) and reaches prehistory. There he meets Bounty Killer (wearing a superhero costume) and Jack Stone (dressed in hat and raincoat like the detective of the 30s), characters who call themselves "sentinels of time" and give him various advice. Moreover, always in prehistoric times, it finds a futuristic base controlled by the same blue robots (called Skunks) where it discovers that, to travel in time, they use red stones (called "spatial stones") similar to the one on the ring.</desc>

		<desc>The ability to move into the future with Time Machines has meant man can monitor activity that may harm the human race and prevent it happening in the present year 2047. You have been summoned to the space-station Historisat for a top secret meeting with the Director himself. Once you have found the meeting place, you get told that one of the androids called Meks will replicate so quickly that all human life will be destroyed in the near future. Meks can't be killed by Humans, only by another Mek with an amulet fully charged. The problem is that the amulet is empty of its power and the only way to charge it is to take it to various historic figures from the past to touch it. You must travel in the time machine into the specific time periods, find the figures and return to the space-station and give the fully powered Mek it to kill the rebel Mek.

Time is an icon driven graphic adventure where the screen represents a console with a screen.

The console part of the screen has various icons that enable you to move your character, pick up/examine/drop/use objects and talk/give objects to other characters. The mouse is used to move an arrow to select your options.</desc>

This video game was originally created by Infogrames in 1987 for various home platforms and converted to MS-DOS by Probe Entertainment in 1989. The aim of the game is to land on the moon while avoiding asteroids and thwarting enemies inside the rocket. Tim and Struppi on the moon was the first PC game with the character Tintin.</desc>

		<desc>The House of Fun is no fun anymore. An evil clown used a magic spell to bring the house into his possession; including all of its inhabitants. The only one spared is the tin man who now has to travel through the side-scrolling levels in order to fight the clown. This game offers the standard platforming action: jumping to avoid falling in holes and touching enemies - if not successful in the latter task, the energy bar decreases which eventually leads to death. However, the player character is not defenseless: he can shoot little sparks at the enemies and he has four spells to his disposal. The latter are basically power-ups which can be activated at will: creating a temporary platform under his feet, floating, invulnerability and a smart bomb. All those spells are limited regarding the number of usages, but refills can be collected during the levels. A boss awaits shortly before each level exit.</desc>

		<desc>This puzzle game has 101 levels, in which you have to guide a varying number of Brainies of four different colors onto a spot that matches their color. You control a cross-hair, and press fire while over a Brainy to take or give up control of its motion. Running out of time costs you a life. The challenge lies in the fact that you can only control the direction in which a Brainy will walk. Once this is set, he will continue to walk until he hits a wall, an obstacle or another Brainy. To make things a bit more complicated, there are various obstacles like arrows that change the direction a Brainy is walking in and items than can optionally be picked up.</desc>

		<name>Tiny Troops</name>
		<desc>On planet Agaris IV, two races fight for power on an endless war. When the Klutes and the Furfurians' dispute made their planet inhospitable, they needed a new battleground. Their troops where teleported to planet Earth, where everything, they discover, is 100 times bigger. Their battles are thus a small event there, taking place out of the attention of the humans.

Tiny Troops is a real-time strategy game, with gameplay similar to Cannon Fodder. It supports up to 2 players in split-screen mode, and mouse or joystick control. Before starting a level, a screen is shown where the player must select which units are going to be on his troop. There's several types of units (foot soldiers, grenadiers, etc). Clicking the general gives a hint and the main objective of the level (that usually is about killing the enemy and destroying their base). Most of the main game screen is occupied by a scrolling map of the level, with the bottom portion reserved for the control windows (one for the mini-map, other for game options like saving and restarting, a third for unit commands and a final one with unit information or a list of group formations). The player controls the soldiers by clicking on them and selecting orders icons from the command window:

- a fist icon is to attack;

- an upward arrow to select the route;

- a wrench to repair things;

- a shield to stand guard;

- a target to surround the unit.

The game has 65 levels spread on a variety of different terrains (garden, kitchen, etc).</desc>

The teams in the game are British but you can edit them using the built-in utilities. 

The game also has a tactics designer and the option to change the kits of each team. You can play either single matches or a full league competition. Tip Off can be played by four players simultaneously, so can play co-op with a friend against the computer, or just compete against one or two other players.</desc>

		<desc>Arthur J. Hackensack, an insane Texas billionaire bent on conquering the world, kidnaps professor Frobisher Goonhilly, a paranormal scientist working on a matter transformation weapon. As a demonstration of its powers, Arthur transforms the Isle of White into a giant custard slice, New York into a bath sponge and the Eiffel Tower into a toast rack. The ghost Blinky, secret agent for S.P.E.C.T.R.E. (Society for the Prevention of Ectoplasmic Crime, Telekinetic misuse and Reality Endangerment), infiltrates the madman's sea ship (the newly raised SS Titanic) armed with an ectoplasmic gun and a case full of disguises.

Titanic Blinky is a platform adventure and a clone of Dizzy, replacing the egg protagonist with a slightly effeminate ghost. As in that game, the aim is to collect objects (by pulling down on the movement controls) to solve puzzles. One main difference from Dizzy is the fact that Blinky carries a gun with infinite ammunition. There's an energy bar at the bottom of the screen that gets depleted every time Blinky touches an enemy. When it's empty, Blinky literally flips over and the player loses one life. The game starts with three lives, and there's no form of saving progress.</desc>

		<name>Titan</name>
		<desc>Titan is a 2D arcade game / puzzle game hybrid.

For some reason, mad professors of the future tend to invent strange entertainment games in which every participant dies. Professor Hybrys’ variant is called Titan and involves a ball, a control unit and 80 labyrinths. Your objective is either to destroy all destructible blocks in each level by hitting them with the sphere, or to pilot it to the exit. The black ball is beyond your control; it will bounce straight or diagonally through the labyrinth with constant speed. You move the control unit, a small box, with you are to position in a way that the ball bounces off it in the desired direction. You can also catch the sphere by quickly moving over it, and then release it in a direction of your choice.

The labyrinths not only contain harmless, destructible blocks, but also increasingly difficult hazards. If the sphere or your control unit hit a skull symbol, one of your nine lives is lost. Teleporters exchange the position of you and the ball, wall pieces can be pushed around or destroyed by your unit, floor tiles will grow into walls when you pass over them too often. The high game speed can be slowed down by holding the space key – a very useful option in tricky situations.

Titan mixes an arcade game foundation (requiring quick reflexes and good nerves) with puzzle game elements (requiring logical thinking to beat the complex levels). The challenge is to control the sphere accurately, yet indirectly.</desc>

The gameplay of Tommy Gun is quite basic. It is a rail shooter with a third person perspective, where you take out your enemies one after the other scrolling from side to side. Each of the five levels have their unique setting and enemies. For example in the super market level you fight against vegetables and in the Paradise Island level you fight against crabs and pirate parrots, just to mention a few.

If you free the prisoners you'll get extra ammo, health packs, shields and other stuff that will help you stay alive a little longer. There is also a two player mode where the second player takes control of the sidekick Big Cheese.</desc>

		<desc>This third-person racing game resembles Gremlin's earlier Lotus series, in terms of its general look and feel, right down to the text font used in the game. Your task is to race through 16 countries, each of which features four races, with many real-world circuits recreated in incongruous locations (such as the Monza layout in Ayers Rock, and the old Hockenheim in Vancouver). 

These four-race blocks each represent their own mini-championship, in which you race against 19 cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, and with the top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, and the respective amount of money in thousands. This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal approach is to buy the more expensive versions ASAP, as you get no saving when upgrading. If you win the four-race championship, you get the next password. 

You get a set amount of nitro boost to use during each race, although bonus nitros, money and instant speed-up token appear on many tracks. Hazards such as puddles, barriers and ramps are also frequent.</desc>

There are various enemies on the screen, which must be hit a number of times to be stopped. The ground-based creatures can then be walked over for points, while the birds simply stop for a few seconds. Your weapons have an arc similar to Kid Gloves, meaning that they hit the ground then rebound to a lower height, making precision aiming important. The level layouts are similar to Rodland, with gaps between platforms, and your character glides in a similar way - some of the disks are suspended in mid-air, and you must control the character's fall to pass over these - thankfully your character isn't harmed by falling. A number of bonus items are on offer, including extra points, extra lives and invincibility</desc>

With a virtually impenetrable stronghold, a bunch of hostages, and a legion of mutants under his command, the evil despot will stop at nothing but world domination. Only two men have the courage and idealistic naivete to take on Akhboob and his forces: Captain Carnage and Major Mayhem, also known as the Doomsday Squad.

As Captain Carnage or Major Mayhem, it is up to you or you and a friend (in simultaneous action) to rescue the hostages while shooting hundreds of mutants bent on your destruction. As you walk and run forward, backward, left, right, and diagonally through 20 battlezones of nonstop action, you'll always have your machine gun by your side. Additional weapons which you can find along the way include grenade launchers, rocket launchers, plasma machine guns, flame throwers, spray-fire rifles, defensive blades, and an assortment of bombs.</desc>

Featuring a low-angle isometric view (not compensated by the d-pad, meaning pressing right will move the player along the half-way line (his right), not in the direction of the right corner flag (the screens' right) like in most games featuring axonometric views, while buttons allow to pass the ball in different strengths or kick at goal. Managing is limited to the choice of eight different formations at the start of the game and half-time.

Options include the usual in the genre: half length (3,5,10,20 and 45 minutes), weather conditions (sunny, rainy, overcast, indoors), referee strictness (full, no cards, no fouls), time stoppages, tie decision (shootout or overtime) and sound (music and sfx, only one of them or none).</desc>

		<name>Total Recall</name>
		<desc>Doug Quaid is a mild-mannered construction worker with a gorgeous wife in an apartment on futuristic Earth.  Plagued by restless feelings and dreams of Mars, he heads to Rekall, Inc to purchase a commercial memory implant of a Martian vacation ("cheaper, better, and safer than the real thing"). However, the implant procedure uncovers latent memories of Quaid's real life as a secret agent for the Martian government. Pursued relentlessly by his former employers, Quaid must fight from Earth to Mars in a battle to reclaim his past and secure his future.

Total Recall for the Amiga and Atari ST has players controlling Quaid as he fights through seven levels on Earth and Mars.  The game alternates between platforming levels and driving levels.  Platforming levels require Quaid to fight guards and find the exit. The player can duck to avoid bullets, and fight back with both captured weapons and meaty Schwarzenegger fists. The first level requires the player to locate items to open the exit, and a later level has the player switching control between Quaid and resistance fighter Melina to solve a puzzle.

Driving levels are high-speed side-scrolling runs, with the player's vehicle moving at a fixed speed.  The player must dodge passing traffic, or blow them apart with weapons. If they survive to the end, they must defeat a mobile "boss" vehicle to end the level.  Cutscenes appear between certain levels that tell the plot of the movie and set up the next scene.</desc>

Each robot's name indicates what their main function and purpose is, and these skills must be combined for success. Each section has its own task - collecting energy pods and destroying mines and bombs for example. The creatures which fill the towers must be avoided, or used to your advantage.</desc>

		<desc>Tower of Souls is set in the land of Chaybore in which seven crystals are responsible for the well being of its citizen. But the evil demon Baalhathrok has taken them and so the player controls Treeac to retrieve them.

In an isometric view, Treeac has to conquer the seven floors of Baalhathrok's tower. The player controls a ball with his mouse and clicks where Treeac should go. Fights are initiated with left clicking on the enemy, for other actions the right mouse button has to be hold while choosing a symbol on the bottom of the screen. Besides of fighting the enemies the player has to open several doors - either by finding the key, pressing the right buttons in the right order or using one of his four lockpicks. When using the lockpicks the player has to beat a mini game where he has to make the correct mouse movements.  

When searching the rooms of the dungeon there are various potions, herbs and magical pieces of equipment to be found. With the herbs the player can mix potions or spells, which are available in four categories: Attacking, defending, transforming and item manipulation. There is no free save system, there are special save points during the game. Every time he wants to save the player has to sacrifice one piece of equipment.</desc>

		<name>Toyota Celica GT Rally</name>
		<desc>A detailed recreation of rallying licensed from Toyota Great Britain. Driving on gravel, asphalt and ice is involved, with each race made up of a series of short stages to complete. After each stage, your times are compared with those of your rivals, whose names are subtly changed from the real drivers of the day. Up to four human players can be involved, taking it in turns.

As visibility is sometimes low, and the exact curvature of a corner isn't always obvious from the apex, a co-driver is provided to give pace notes. These can be adjusted before you take to the track, specifying what is defined as 'hard left' and how early the warning should be given.

The steering sensitivity can be adjusted, and you can choose between automatic centering, and a push-the-opposite-way-to-centre mode, but more unusual is the option to race with the steering directions reversed - definitely one for advanced players.</desc>

		<desc>The Toyottes is a really fun looking game, but unfortunately, the graphics are the best thing about it. Quite humorous graphics can draw you into the game. An average use of colour, but the backdrops are pretty bland. Couple this with lots going on, and you get a very confusing play. Also some good music, with a good variety of sound effects during the game. Overall, they add to the humour of the graphics quite well. The basic idea is pretty good, and fighting the various monsters is quite fun, but once you've seen most of the screens and baddies the game loses its addictiveness and appeal. As far as platform games go, Toyottes isn't that great and not really something I can recommend.</desc>

Call me old-fashioned, but I'm in it for the effects--explosions are good, and the last blue 'rippley-looking level' really hit the eye-cones. Music's good. Overall: difficult, somewhat interesting.</desc>

Short and long-range scanners are available to aid in this.

The game takes place in a maze world containing a number of distinct sectors, each of which has its own type of enemy present. The Communication Centre powers the Cycloids, and are protected by the Defenders. Once these are taken out, the Centerpoint Sector must be destroyed to complete the level.</desc>

Transarctica is a strategic trading and combat game, rather like Elite in many ways. You must keep your train running, and make sure there is enough fuel. When you reach towns you can trade with local people, with each city having a primary function. These towns often contain useful information to put you on the right track in your mission. You are in possession of slaves, who are traded just like other commodities.

Contact with other trains results in combat. Buy upgrades to boost your performance in combat, to increase your chance of fending off the Viking Union.</desc>

		<desc>The basic Asteroids gameplay features of rocks which break into smaller rocks when shot, and the game’s playfield rotating around the player, are implemented in this shoot ‘em up. Besides the rocks, there are lots of spaceships, many of which shoot at the player, and some which are clearly ‘inspired’ by the designs in Star Wars. All of these must be cleared to complete the level.

The player starts the game with 3 very basic ships, having no firepower, flexibility or shield upgrades. On each level, money can be collected, which can be spent on these items. Every item can be upgraded through five levels, although these are increasingly expensive. There is no points system however.

Rather innovatively, the game hands out passwords after each game so the player can continue at the start of the level on which the last life was lost. This means that if more than one life was lost on the same level, all of them will be back, and also any purchased power-up is taken back and the money returned (allowing the player to make new decisions).</desc>

Unlike the other installments in the series the player has only one life without any energy bars to complete the game and is unable to select any particular item from the inventory for use. Items are rolled up through the inventory so the top one is used or dropped.</desc>

Play with perfectly spherical stones of crystallized, colored gems on a hexagon-shaped field, formed by beams of pure-white light from diamond powered laser-beams.
Place your gemstones at the intersections of light. When three of your stones are correctly positioned, the stones resonate with the laser-light to form ideal triangles of shimmering color that control territory and capture your opponent's stones.
Play until your opponent cannot move and you win!
Play TrianGo against a friend or the computer. But beware, for instilled in the computer is the knowledge of Ancient Masters.</desc>

		<name>Trivial Pursuit (Disc 1)</name>
		<desc>This is the earliest home computer incarnation of Horn Abbot International Ltd's classic board game, Trivial Pursuit. The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports.

Two game modes are available: Single Player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and Multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.

The question categories are exactly the same as the board game: Art &amp; Literature, Science &amp; Nature, Geography, History, Sports &amp; Leisure, and Entertainment. However two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music. 

One additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.</desc>

The Elders are all located in different parts of the galaxy, and can only be reached by travelling through the galaxy answering questions correctly, and answering a specific question once you get there. As a result, the gameplay isn't vastly different from the original. 

The six question categories are the same as the original, and there are 50 levels of question to clear, but the big difference is that the question category is random, so players who are only knowledgeable in one or two areas are no longer at an advantage.</desc>

		<name>Trivial Pursuit : The Computer Game, Genus Edition</name>
		<desc>This is the earliest home computer incarnation of Horn Abbot International Ltd's classic board game, Trivial Pursuit. The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports.

Two game modes are available:- single player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.

The question categories are exactly the same as the board game, however two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music. 

One additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.</desc>

		<desc>Troddlers is a puzzle game in the vein of Lemmings. The player takes control of an animal-like wizard who can create and remove blocks; these blocks are useful for both jumping onto and redirecting the path of the little Troddlers that you have to direct towards the exit. The tricky bit is that the Troddlers can climb walls and ceilings, following the edge of the world and the exit is often in the middle of the screen or with an obstacle in the way.</desc>

		<desc>Trog! (Also known as 'Og') was the second game Dave Parsons of Confused Pelican wrote for the Amiga. It was a fairly short, sideways-scrolling game in the Wonderboy style. It used pixel-perfect collision detection routines and ran in 32-colour mode. He revisited it later and made a much more colourful AGA version which had 64 colours, much smoother sky colours and screen fades, and a 1-bit parallax background layer. Outside of the game itself, it's really not very polished, and has pretty awful music.</desc>

		<desc>This platform game features the small blue-haired cutesy creatures that were popular around the time (although surely not with most computer game buyers?). You play a Troll roaming the levels in the hope of rescuing as many baby trolls as possible - each level gives you a set minimum to retrieve before you can leave via the Pigstop.

Initially you have no weapons, and contact with the nasties costs you energy, but a Yo-Yo can be collected, which can be used not only to kill enemies, but also to smash blocks away and open up paths, and even (with practice) tied to a ledge to allow you to swing across a gap. 

Throughout the levels you will find the letters B,O,N,U,S and G released from bonus balloons or on killing an enemy - if at the end of a level your letters spell out Bonus or Bogus you go to the appropriate extra level. The former has a chance to gain extra lives, the latter must be escaped quickly to avoid losing a life.</desc>

		<name>Tube Warriors</name>
		<desc>Isn't life full of surprises? Last month, there was us thinking that Flair's Dangerous Streets had to be the last word in awesomely awful beat 'em-ups but no! Ã¢â‚¬â€ here comes Tube Warriors all set to make us rethink just how bad games can get. The big pity with Tube Warriors is that the basic engine for an excellent Street Fighter 2 clone Ã¢â‚¬â€ or even a perfect conversion of the coin-op itself Ã¢â‚¬â€ is in place. Trouble is, it's obvious that having written it the programmers have no idea what to do with it. The backdrops, for example, move as nicely as any in Street Fighter, with loads of top foreground and background parallax effects, but they're just so drab and unexciting to look at. Likewise, the fighters are poorly drawn (something of an understatement, to be honest) and stiffly animated, but they bounce around swiftly enough. Now I could live with ropey graphics if the gameplay was any good but, to be blunt, it's a mess. The joystick control is sheer crap; if you simply want to walk left and right you have to make the character take each step by tapping the joystick in the required direction, so you can imagine what a nightmare the combat moves are to pull off. There are many other things I could go on about Ã¢â‚¬â€ the crude presentation, the fact that you can't choose your character in one player mode, the duff sound Ã¢â‚¬â€ but I think you get the idea. I took this home to review over the weekend and even my girlfriend, who still thinks Space Invaders is advanced computer entertainment, recognised it as crap. Stay well away for fear of contamination.</desc>

		<name>Tubular Worlds</name>
		<desc>One of the most popular game genres in the late 80' and the early 90's so a bit unusual to see this kind of game made in 1994. Tubular Worlds doesn't offer anything new and in my opinion it looks like Dongleware was a bit too late with getting this game published since they missed the general game market with a few years.

Apart from that Tubular Worlds is a well developed game offering the usual side scroller interface where the entire goal in the game is to shoot up as many enemies as possible. The more you shoot the better your spaceship gets. You can get better weapons, faster movement and other great improvements. The game consists of many different enemies and also multiple levels so there are many hours of game play.

Overall a nice side scroller but both the graphics and sound could have been better considering the age of this game. Of course this is not the most important in a game and the developers have programmed with this on their mind.</desc>

		<name>Turbo Cup</name>
		<desc>Based on sportscar and Paris-Dakar racer René Metge and his Porsche 944 Turbo, Turbo Cup is a racing game viewed from above and behind the car, in a forced perspective. Instead of the sand of the Dakar race, the game features four conventional French racetracks - Paul Ricard, Nogaro, Magny-Cours and Dijon-Prenois. 

After completing a qualifying lap you race against 21 similar cars. Contact with cars from behind causes you to spin but does not affect your rival, although side-on contact is usually beneficial. There are hazards off the track to avoid, and hitting the grass at speed causes a spin.</desc>

There are 16 stages set across the US, gradually moving from east to west, all depicted differently visually. After every 4 levels, you go into a shop screen, with a choice of upgrades. As the title implies, you now have a turbo booster installed, which speeds up the car, although over-use can cause the engine to overheat, and it is not recharged until each shop section. You have 5 continues, and failure to complete the course within the time limit costs you one.</desc>

		<desc>Have any of you out there had a run in with your folks because your Scalextric or TCR cars flew off the track and hit the cat or smashed an ornament? You have? Well this is just the thing for you! Turbo Trax is a slot racing system incorporating all the features of a standard layout Ã¢â‚¬â€œ including crossovers, chicanes and even a pit stop Ã¢â‚¬â€œ without the hassle of causing severe damage to anything else. Good, eh?

Once the options have been set, moving to the OK icon exits the menu and moves to the track. The race is seen as a plan view on a split or single screen Ã¢â‚¬â€œ depending on the selections made. The cars (or car if you're playing a time trial) sit on the grid with their engines running, until the green light appears and they're off!

You steer by pointing the joystick in the direction of the track (except on curves) and get a burst of speed by pressing the fire button. Zooming too fast into crossovers or chicanes will turn you over and cause damage, as will riding fast over rough track. However, repairs and refueling can be carried out by stopping in the red and white zone of the pits. Unfortunately, a crash involving both cars on a crossover causes the race to be abandoned.</desc>

		<name>Turbo</name>
		<desc>Turbo is a traditional top-view scroller, much in the spirit of Spy Hunter. It can be played against the clock, which is enormous but short-duration fun, against another player, which is enormously enormous fun, or over a comms link, which is critically unreliable according the publishers.

The excuse for a scenario is set in the uncomfortably near future. For no adequately explained reason, the populace have decided that commuting is dull and every other vehicle and pedestrian is fair game. Some unknown character has strewn the road with bolt-on goodies, all designed to get yourself noticed. Missiles and grenades fire forwards, the only differences being speed and range. Oil causes anything behind you to lose control, while hub spikes knock out the competition at the sides. Closet kamikazes are also catered for with the turbo wheels, which allow extreme speed at the expense of any control whatsoever.

The graphics work, the sound is suitably grotesque and the whole thing is presented with the panache of a dead stoat. But it is such manic fun to play that that all goes out of the window. If I had to describe Turbo as glibly as possible, I would go about it this: Audio-Visual Jadedness is the disease, Turbo is the cure.</desc>

This side scrolling arcade adventure is split into three stages, taking in the harsh and barren desert, an underground network of caves, and a tough tribal jungle. The natives are hostile to your presence, and weaponry must be found to fend them off, although its use does little to put the natives at ease initially. The machete to cut through the jungle is equally important. At many other points you will need to use objects you have found along the way. The backgrounds are in full 3D and can serve to obscure the character when he is behind trees or rocks.</desc>

The game uses varying camera positions, with top-down views when the ball is close to either hoop, and a side-view when the ball is mid-court - controls remain unchanged for these, so the switch doesn't cause a sudden change in player movement.

As well as playing the matches you have full coaching control. This can involve making substitutions but also assigning marking and game strategies.</desc>

		<desc>After the Cariken family became complacent, the land of Gaspar ceased to be ruled as well. This left the way clear for evil men such as Maldur the druid to step in and slaughter the family, shattering their magical amulet. Only one of the family survived, and the amulet was broken into 23 pieces. 

As Ulopa, the sole survivor, you must reclaim the pieces. They are spread across 23 levels of platforming action, combining surface areas with some underground tunnels. You have 3 types of weapons with different functionality: switching between them at the right moments is vital. You can also collect upgrades from the carcasses of dead enemies. Other upgrades such as springs and a parachute can also be found.</desc>

		<name>Twylyte</name>
		<desc>Twylyte is an arcade 3D shoot-em-up in the tradition of Space Harrier and Backlash. The player drives towards the horizon continuously at enormous speed. There are indestructible barriers which the invisible player ship must avoid contact with, as well as enemies shooting and firing missiles at the player. Beside moving left and right, the ship can also moved up and down, which adds further possibilities to evade the barriers, but also makes it difficult to shot at moving enemies at different height.

The key goal in the game is energy. You lose energy on getting hit, and if the energy falls to low, you even cannot shoot back. If it drops completely, the game is over. Gaining energy can be achieved by collecting green energy blocks and at special stages, in which energy blocks can be collected between barriers without moving enemies. The hint to the energy stones is the radar, on which dots indicate upcoming objects.

The graphics are drawn as polygons, although you can optionally switch to wireframe graphics. Only rare enemy objects are rotating, most static elements are just zooming perspectively, giving the impression of zooming sprites.</desc>

		<desc>After the defeat of the evil wizard Mondain and his mistress Minax in the previous two Ultimas, peace has returned to the land of Sorsaria. Times passes and eventually geological disruptions and a resurgence of the monster populace occur, and it is soon learned that Mondain and Minax had conceived a child named Exodus before their death. Now that child has become an adult with the power to avenge the death of his parents. Obviously, it falls upon the hero from Earth to find and stop him. The third title in the Ultima series was the first to feature a party of adventurers instead of a single player character. The party is created at the beginning of the game by assigning various class combinations and determining the characters' attributes. The game has larger and more detailed towns, populated by NPCs the protagonist can converse with to obtain clues. Like in earlier Ultima games, exploration is divided between top-down overworld locations and first-person 3D dungeons. This installment introduces separate combat screens where player-controlled party fights multiple monsters in a turn-based tile-based system.</desc>

		<name>Ultima IV : Quest of the Avatar</name>
		<desc>The fourth game in the Ultima series features an improved game engine, with color graphics and enhanced character interaction: the player can have conversations with non-playable characters by typing names of various topics. However, the main difference between Ultima IV and its predecessors in the series (as well as other role-playing games) lies in the game's objectives and the ways to fulfill them. Instead of building up a character by any means possible in order to face a villain in the end of the game, in Ultima IV the player is trying to become the Avatar, a role model for people. This means upholding the Eight Virtues, basically trying to become a better person. Making morally conscious decisions and helping other people is not done expecting a material reward, but because it is the actual goal of the game and the main focus of its gameplay. The game frowns on behavior typical of most other RPGs, such as backstabbing fleeing enemies or picking up everything that isn't nailed down even if it does not belong to the protagonist. This different approach established the game's reputation as the first "true" Ultima, influencing the design philosophy of later installments and the overall spirit of the series.</desc>

Lord British, the country's benevolent monarch, has disappeared, and a man named Blackthorn has usurped his throne. The tyrant rules the land by enforcing the virtues upon the will of the people, corrupting their meaning in the process. His fundamentalist visions led him to create a police state, where failure to adhere to the virtues is punishable by death. Behind Blackthorn are the three Shadowlords, anti-thesis to the three principles of Truth, Love, and Courage. The Avatar must understand their meaning and origins, find a way to defeat them, rescue Lord British, and restore the former ethical principles of Britannia.</desc>

		<desc>The Great White Shark (NormanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s obligatory silly golfing nickname) has only recently been knocked off his number one spot by Nick Faldo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ maybe he should practise a bit more on his own golfing sim!

Up to four human or computer players can participate, in Strokepay or Matchplay, with the option of playing Singles, Fourball, Foursome, or Greensome. The skill level of each computer player is determined by setting five factors: Experience, Stance, Grip, Swing, and Fitness. Up to fifty created players can be stored in a database.

After leaving three of your 17 clubs behind (you are only allowed 14), it is out onto either of two in-built courses (or others from planned course disks). From the first tee you are greeted by a 3-D view, a grid of squares raised and sunk at different angles to form hills and bunkers. Additional hazards are posed by trees and water pools. As the flag is often hidden, a map allows you to view the whole hole Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you can even walk to any spot and get a 3-D view from that position.

When you are ready to play the shot, a power meter appears. A power bar rises, stopped by pressing fire. Then, before another falling bar reaches the bottom, you must press fire to stop a swaying direction needle in the middle for a straight shot, or on the marker indicating the amount of sidespin selected on the swing screen. Putting is achieved by aiming an on-screen cursor and selecting power.

Despite the number of options available this is not an excessively fancy game. It is accurate, intelligent and challenging and will prove to be one of the most popular sports sims of the year.</desc>

On each level you will be faced with puzzles and battles and you need to get the high score you pass to the next level.  If your health reaches zero you will die and the game is over.  Fortunately, your health is replenished at the end of each level.</desc>

		<desc>Side-scrolling shoot-em-up, in a similar style to such games as Gradius, R-Type and Scramble. The aim is to wipe out the enemy, which has gathered around the allied airspace of 'Area 88', in a series of military aircraft-based scenarios.
 You choose one of three unique pilots; Shin Kazama, Micky Schymon or Greg Gates, each with varying abilities at damage repair, weapon handling and flying skill, and engage the enemy over a series of challenging missions. The player starts out with the weakest plane, the F8E Crusader, which can only be armed with a very basic range weapons. But, through completing various missions, enough cash can be raised to purchase higher-quality aircraft. These superior planes are more agile, have improved resilience to damage and have a greater range of fire. Furthermore, the more advanced fighters can be armed with superior special weapons, such as napalm.
 The missions include attacks on sand bases, the nuclear submarine 'Seavet' and enemy supply camps, as well as seeing off groups of airborne 'bandits' who swarm-in on Area 88.
 The enemy is plentiful, and the pace is frantic. Shoot at everything on the screen that moves, and the allied forces might just come out on top......</desc>

		<desc>Utopia takes the Sim City gameplay concept and adds a military element to it. The game is set in the distant future, where your job is nothing less than Colony Administrator for a new settlement on some far-flung planet. Your aim is to provide the highest Quality of Life rating for the colonists. 

You do so by ensuring that there is enough life support, power, housing, employment, police and entertainment to keep the citizens of your colony happy. Hindering your goal are random events such as solar eclipses (which can render your solar panels inactive) and also a different, hostile alien race that inhabits the planets in the many scenarios at offer. 

Not only do you have to be a good mayor but you also have to be a good general. Resources must not only be attributed to civilian research but into weapons research, intelligence and the building of tanks and spaceships, if you wish to survive long enough to see your colony flourish into a metropolis. As a rule, you will have built a strong colony before the aliens come, but the final push towards a QOL of 80% or higher can only be achieved once there is no outside threat.</desc>

		<desc>In this prequel to Valhalla and the Lord of Infinity, you play Infinity's mentor on his quest of hatred in which murder is the ultimate goal.

Infinity has been jealous of his brother, the Good King Garamond, for as long as he can remember, and all for a twist of fate. Infinity had been born too late to be king.

Set in the mystical castle of Valhalla, you encounter a horde of brain melting puzzles through four vast levels of dazzling graphics and exceptional gameplay in which the art of communication is the name of the game. 

Use the joystick button to bring up a series of icon that let you access a map of the level, or to look at, pick up, operate, or move objects. The disk icon that is among them allows you to save, load, or restart a game. Some of these icons are available when you choose to use an inventory object on something on the screen. 

There are two bars on either side of the screen. One bar is your stamina. Whenever you stand on a hazard, your stamina decreases. When you have no stamina left, you die and are forced to restart the level. The other bar indicates, if you have picked up a flask, how much time that you have left before it is empty.</desc>

The game is a top-down adventure using a joystick- and icon-based control system. When you walk up to an object you wish to investigate, press fire to gain access to the icons at the bottom of the screen, with which you can look at, pick up or use an object. There are also people who will talk to you.

And I mean 'talk' - the game is full of speech for every action, including your character saying things such as "There's nothing here" and "I can't do that" in response to each instruction. Each level has one disk's worth of speech, and there's no disk swapping during the game.

The level designs include hidden holes in the floor, but there are maps to locate these.</desc>

The field of battle is a toroidal grid on which your tri-colored half-sphere base cells sit awaiting your protection.  The invading cells (also tri-colored spheres) attempt to bond together into groups and destroy your bases.  You destroy the infecting cells by lobbing antibodies (also tri-colored spheres) at them.  Hit an infector with the right color shot and it is destroyed.  The catch is that you have a limited amount of each color of ammunition.  Run out of a color and the game is over.  The situation is also complicated by Spitters, enemies that appear and spew out new attacking cells if you take too long to complete a level.</desc>

		<desc>This one on one future sport combines ideas from a number of real-world competitions, most notably the schoolgirl favourite Netball (I wonder why the ad blurb makes no mention of this?). The action is viewed isometrically, so moving the joystick up moves your droid north-east, down moves south-west, and so on.

The aim is to score more points than your opponent in each match, and be the first to win four matches (against either a human or computer opponent), before moving up to the next difficulty level. There is a goal in the middle at each end, and the ball can be advanced by shooting it (the length of a shot is affected by pushing the joystick up or down with fire pressed) as you can't run with the ball, or hold onto it for long. The main novel idea in the game is the shaping of the pitches, which are viewed in full 3D and have bumps and big divots all around.</desc>

While power in Britain has been restored after the death of King Arthur and the destruction of evil sorceress Morgan Le Fay a terrible force has been unleashed. The demonic Shadowmaster, a dark summoning of the slain witch, is terrorizing Britain entrapping the King and stealing the fair court enchantress, Nineve. You must command the knights of the kingdom to find and destroy the vile beast. 

The gameplay takes place in seven acts or episodes and features a mix of RPG and simple strategy game (for combat) elements. The game world itself is loosely based on medieval Spain, and features dozens of towns, cities, and castles. Traveling from location to location takes place on an overhead map, while each actual location consists of picturesque hand-painted backdrops depicting the type of environment it is set in. The interface is entirely mouse-driven (although keyboard short-cuts are also present), iconic, and streamlined to make it accessible to inexperienced game players.</desc>

This is where the fun really begins! You will meet vampires, two and three headed monsters - the head will fly at you on its own, just when you think you are gaining the upper hand.

The road winds on and on, through tombs containing the bones of former seekers after fame and very much alive Eldrich horrors. Trapdoors and elevators transport you - sometimes to your surprise inside ancient buildings and under lakes and oceans. Collect icons to build up the firepower necessary to fight off your aggressors.

Action and excitement all the way with this macabre and unusual game; which has that elusive extra something to keep you coming back for more.</desc>

Most of the planes come at you in formation, firing easily-visible orange bullets at you, and can be either shot or avoided. The turrets are capable of rotating in 8 directions and aiming at you as best they can, so be careful to dodge their bullets. 

There are also larger vehicles which fly down the screen in a direct vertical line. The helicopters hold power-ups including extra weapons (which you only get for a limited number of shots; this is the one time where holding down fire constantly (on an auto fire joystick) isn't hugely beneficial), speed-ups and energy recharge (once your vehicle's damage reaches 100%, you lose that one of your 5 lives). The planes are huge and fire a constant volley at you, but offer a huge 5,000 points if taken down. At the end of each level an even bigger plane comes at you, weaving from left to right while gradually moving down the screen (and eventually out of the bottom of the screen and back through the top).</desc>

There are 3 different circuits on offer, to be raced in any order, each with a full field of computer opponents to face. The AI has a very rigid feel, and it's one of those racing games where they're better thought of as a succession of obstacles, sticking to the same racing line, and carrying on unscathed from contact even if you spin.

There are several different viewpoints on offer, both 2D overhead and 3D. Especially on the Advanced course, some corners are very tight, and the run-off areas quite sluggish to rejoin from.</desc>

		<name>Vital Light</name>
		<desc>"Vital Light" is one of those innovative games which only appear once a while. In this particular one, you have to control a small paint gun that contains five different colored paints, and destroy blocks that are falling toward you by making them all the same color. Your paint gun is on a roller at the bottom of the screen, and horizontal strips of colored blocks fall from the top of the screen at varying speeds. Holding down the fire button and pushing left or right changes the currently selected color, and sometimes you only just have enough time to get the right color before the blocks smash into you. As the blocks fall at varying speeds, there are times when an avalanche is set off by a slow block being hit by a fast moving block above it. This is a game that gets very, very frantic.</desc>

Each level must be completed within a time limit, but progressing from left to right. She is armed with a whip, a useful weapon for attacking the denizens of dinosaurs on each level. Lots of bonus items can also be whipped to activate them - bonus lives and extra time for example. Tokens to turn into a fox can also be collected - enough of these takes you into a bonus level set underground.</desc>

The player controls one of the 3 Viz characters - Johnny Fartpants, Buster Gonad, or Biffa Bacon. The race takes place in five different scrolling environments; country, town, building site, beach and a disco. During the race you have to dodge traps and other characters from the VIZ comics.</desc>

		<name>Volfied</name>
		<desc>Volfied is a home conversion of an arcade coin-op developed by Taito in the late '80s. The game is very similar to Qix -- the player takes control of an object whose purpose is to roam the screen, forming shapes and removing them from the play field. By way of reward, a picture is gradually revealed in the removed areas of the screen. The borders of the area which the player has not cleared become the border of the area the player's pointer can move along.

The player's object must avoid contact with any of the enemies which float around the screen, as this will weaken and eventually destroy it. Barriers limit which parts of the border boxes can be formed through. The goal is to clear 80% or more of the screen, and each additional percent adds bonus points.

As an arcade conversion this game allows for one or two player games in three difficulty levels, but offers no passwords or saved games across its numerous levels.</desc>

As former POW Luke Snayles, you must destroy each of these fleets of 80 aliens, before they can be dispatched.

Voyager is viewed from on board the craft, and is a first person shoot 'em up using polygon graphics. You start with a laser and a few bombs, but can collect extra weaponry and the ability to fly through the mothership. Not all enemies can be killed simply by shooting them, so there is a tactical element to the slaughter.</desc>

From the time of Vasco da Gama and Columbus (the late 1400s) to the French Revolution (1789), you are put in charge of a nation's imperial destiny.  This means financing voyages, assembling crews, sending out land and sea expeditions, founding colonies, and occasionally engaging other European powers for global dominance.

Exploration may seem familiar to players of Civilization, Colonization, Conquest of the New World, Gold of the Americas, and even Sid Meier's Pirates!, as they borrow from exploration and cover a similar topic.</desc>

		<path>./WackyDarts_v1.0.lha</path>
		<name>Wacky Darts</name>
		<desc>The bar room game of darts involves aiming small projectiles at a circular board. The board is divided into 20 shapes around the edge, each of which has a value from 1 to 20 points, a special double area around the edge and a special treble area in the middle (each of which multiply the shot score). There is also a bullseye right in the middle for 50 points and an outer bull around it, worth 25 points. Players always take three shots at a time. In the 501 game the aim is to reduce the score from 501 to 0, finishing with a double or the bull. If the score reaches 1 or a negative number, any shots in that set of 3 are cancelled out. In Round The Board, the player must hit each target in turn starting with 20, but moving back 2 or 3 for a double or treble, eventually finishing with Double Top. Both of these games are recreated in this simulation. The movement of the cursor you use to aim is slightly skiddy, to recreate natural jitters (or, as some would cynically suggest, the effects of being as drunk as most darts players). Wacky Darts lives up to its name by featuring an assortment of human, alien, and machine opponents of varying difficulties. Each of them has a short profile, and use a different object to hit the board.</desc>

		<desc>You take on the role of Dastardly and Mutley from the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series in this action title with superficial racing overtones. Your aim is to complete each course in a particular position, which is achieved either by waiting for them to suffer enough damage to drop out of the race, or by inflicting that damage yourself. Your car is armed with a forward-shooting arrow to impale the opposition cars, and deal with the many hazards the races throw at you, including boulders and rabbits, which can be taken out for points. 

The action is viewed from the side, scrolling horizontally as you progress, and vertically when you need to jump or duck over the bigger hazards, which must be avoided Moon Patrol style, meaning that you must often time one jump properly so as to be able to make the next one successfully. In some sections of the road you can duck down onto another set of roads, which may or may not be less hazardous. Falling into thin air costs you a life, while heavy impacts deduct some of your energy points. When the view doesn’t show the next section, and the correct course is not clear, an arrow appears to direct you.</desc>

		<desc>J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth is the 16-bit game with additional adventuring features compared to the 8-bit version, loosely depicting the events of the One Ring from the Shire to Mt. Doom. The game starts with the three hobbits: Frodo, Sam, and Pippin surrounded by nine individual units of Nazgul near the Shire. Although the first task is to travel to Rivendell, the player is free to decide how heroes and armies progress, despite the in-game conventional storyline. Victory is attained by successfully sending the ring bearer to Mt. Doom - how this accomplished is completely up to the player. Additionally, any hero including Frodo may die during combat. If the ring bearer dies during combat, a new ring bearer (if they survive the encounter) will be appointed to carry the One Ring. If the enemy gains possession of the One Ring is taken by the enemy, they will attempt to reach Barad-Dur, Sauron's fortress in the heart of Mordor, which will result in the player's defeat. The player will also lose if the enemy manages to seize three major allied citadels.</desc>

The series' main distinguishing feature was the way you always viewed all 4 tanks in a platoon at the same time, via a split screen. Action here is purely mouse-driven. The AI has been significantly updated from previous games in the series. A full roster of tanks and weapons are included, with Iraq mainly using Soviet machinery. A major consideration involves destroying particular buildings for money, and preventing other particular ones being destroyed, also for financial reasons.</desc>

		<desc>The first in the Warlords series. Basically, your mission is world domination. This may be played between up to 8 people all on the same machine. It is a medieval type strategy game that requires the player to control 80 cities in the realm of Illuria. In order to do so you must wipe out your 7 opponents. 

Gold is accrued through the ownership of cities. The gold is then used to create armies. Heroes can sometimes "find" things or be rewarded by sages (there are only 2 and it's a first come first served basis). You can choose between various human and non-human peoples, as well as the ubiquitous evil Warlord. This is a very early version of what strategy games eventually became.</desc>

		<desc>Only you can save the world from destruction, by finding four parts of the weapon to use against the Alien Syndicate's evil leader. This task must be completed within 80 minutes, although you have five lives available.

Gameplay mainly involves propelling your jumpsuit-backed and powerfully-armed character through the levels, destroying the alien forces as he goes. The levels have lots of pieces of ledges and spikes all around, which must be planned around, as well as lava pits. There is extra weaponry and ammunition to collect along the way. Your main weapon can be fired in any direction, but you can't move and fire at the same time unless you're firing to the left or right.</desc>

The game consist of 8 top-down scrolling missions in which you're controlling Arnold-like soldier armed with basic machine gun. Each mission is taking place in different location with little repetitive signs further in the game. Starting point is at the jungle, but you will also visit some kind of stores, sewers and factories. Your task is to get at the end of mission and destroy main boss. Throughout your way a lot of enemies is waiting for you. Expect heavy resistance by infantry armed with machine guns, guided missiles and grenades. Of course, enemies are using plenty of vehicles so prepare for trains, tanks, helicopters, jeeps and even one submarine. Luckily you aren't reliant to machine gun only. Shoot boxes with "W" sign and arm yourself with better/stronger weapons like grenades thrower, flammer, guided missiles launcher or laser. Also watch carefully for hostages. If you release one, you'll be awarded with points or health-pack.</desc>

		<desc>Waterloo, arguably the most famous battle in history, was fought on June 18, 1815 between the French Forces of the Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte and the English and combined Allied forces under the Duke of Wellington and Prussian forces under Field Marshall Blucher.

Waterloo the game was a revolutionary new concept in wargaming when it was published in 1989. Waterloo dispensed with the normal overview given to wargame commanders and instead gave a player the same point of view as real commanders on the field of battle.

Your orders in an age of pre-radio communication must pass through an elaborate chain of command with varying levels of success in the execution of those orders. Your orders may even be ignored if there is better local intelligence or your officers lack the skill or courage to perform them. You as the commander (Napoleon or Wellington) must even deal with a time delay in the occurrence in events and the time it takes for those events to be relayed back to HQ and the time it takes to issue orders and see those orders carried out. A text parser is used to issue orders during the game. The battle ends at 9:30 pm at which time full battle reports will become available and the results assessed. You are also given the option to review the battlefield.The game is solitaire only and the playing time is 10-20 hours.</desc>

in the rectangular playground. But Welltris changes this rectangular arena into a four

wall to wall within the well. Form the pieces into solid rows either horizontally or vertically
on the bottom of the well.

In Arm Wrestling you must pull the joystick back when the arm in the central display has entered a strong phase and press the button to prop the arm up then hope for the best. The Beershooting event requires you to shoot a 5 beer glass targets faster than your opponent, but this is not too easy if you get nervous.Player 1 moves the joystick to the right to draw their gun, while Player 2 must move theirs to the left. Once the gun is drawn, the crosshairs are used to line up the target. Press the joystick button to fire. A beating heart shows the degree of your nervousness in the display. Quid-spitting requires that you bite off the right amount of tobacco and chew it to just the right consistency before you determine what angle to spit it into the pot. This requires some fancy joystick handling. To lift your arm and bite off the quid, you must move the joystick forward.To chew, you must move the joystick fast to the left and right. Don't chew it too long or too short. To stop chewing, you must move the joystick forward. Once that is done you must pull the stick back to determine the strength. Click and hold the joystick button to determine the right angle. Press the joystick button to spit. Timing is the key. The Milking event has a rhythmically heaving udder indicating the beat that you must move the joystick. To fill the cans, the joystick must be moved in a predetermined pattern, but it must be moved rythmically with the udder. You can elbow your opponent to get the upper hand by moving your joystick to the right and pressing the joystick button. Dancing requires a complicated routine of joystick movements to do certain dance moves while keeping the beat. Lose the beat and the other guys bash the piano player on the head causing him to stop playing. You must buy the piano player another beer to have him resume playing. The Eating competition is the final event. Dip the spoon into the stew. Balance the spoon. Slurp. Chew. Swallow. and drink. Simple? No. If you get some out of order, you get delayed by belching. Dip the spoon by moving the joystick back. Balance the spoon by moving the joystick to the left and right.; Once leveled, slurp. Chew by again moving the joystick to the right and left. To swallow, pull the joystick back and press the joystick button. Finish it off with a drink before you dip the spoon in again, by moving the joystick forward.</desc>

		<name>Steve McQueen Westphaser</name>
		<desc>This game came as a pack-in title with Loriciel's light gun controller of the same name. Most light guns opted for a futuristic look and feel, but the West Phaser was inspired more by 19th century Colt revolvers, and aptly enough the bundled game was a Western-themed shooter - with similar mechanics to Operation Wolf, except for the stationary screens.Up to six players can pick their characters from a Who's Who of the American Old West: Doc Holliday, Calamity Jane, Will Bill Hickok, and every other big-name lawman and gunfighter in collective imagination. Outlaws like Jesse James, Billy the Kid and Belle Starr are sowing terror in the murky saloons and dusty streets, and it's your job to stop them if you're after that coveted Sheriff's badge... or the big fat rewards on their heads.Each location throws wave after wave of humorously-drawn attackers at you - bandits, cowboys, Indians, Mexicans, all thrown together into a big pile of cartoonish violence. A burning candle represents your life bar and there's plenty of enemies trying to snuff it out, so you'll have to be quick on the draw (but don't forget to protect the innocent). When the face of the bandit you're after starts blinking on the status bar, prepare for the showdown: nail them and the reward is yours.Apparently the light gun was not the biggest success, and less than three years later the game was re-released, this time with support for other input devices - and a new title, Steve McQueen: Westphaser, despite having exactly nothing to do with any of McQueen's characters.</desc>

		<name>Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego</name>
		<desc>Where in Europe Is Carmen Sandiego? is a 1988 European geography-based educational video game in the detective mystery franchise Carmen Sandiego. It was originally published by Broderbund in 1988 for Apple I , Commodore 64 and MS-DOS , and ported to the Apple IIGS , Amiga and Macintosh in 1989. It is the third Carmen Sandiego title, after world-based Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? (1985) and US-based Where in the USA Is Carmen Sandiego? (1986). Under the guidance of The Acme Agency's chief, the player completes cases to catch Carmen's henchmen; they accomplish this by traveling to European locations to investigate clues relating to the crook's last known whereabouts, and by gaining enough character data to issue a warrant of arrest. Once the player has captured all 15 thieves, they are able to chase after Carmen herself.</desc>

		<name>Where in the USA is Carmen Sandiego</name>
		<desc>The gameplay is similar to that of its predecessor, Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?. The goal of the game is to track Carmen's henchmen across the United States, arrest them, and ultimately arrest Carmen Sandiego, who has escaped from a European prison and has gone to the US to assemble a gang of V.I.L.E. members to steal the country's treasures.

The player, an agent of ACME Detective Agency, must gather information on the suspect and use it to obtain a warrant to reduce the potential suspects to one of the V.I.L.E. members in the database. The player must then track the criminal to the final destination and make an arrest. The player advances in rank throughout the game, eventually reaching the level of Super Sleuth. The player captures 16 of Carmen's crooks before having a chance to arrest her.

The main screen interface is divided into four sections showing the day, time, and location; textual information, an image from the current city, and the available actions. The game was supplied with a special copy of Fodor's USA encyclopedia as a reference guide and a travel guide book.  The deluxe version of the game includes more than 50 digitized photographs, numerous state topographical maps, digitized sounds, and music.</desc>

		<name>Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?</name>
		<desc>Carmen Sandiego is a master thief who leads the criminal organization V.I.L.E. This organization specializes in stealing the world's treasures without a trace. Alarmed by this, the A.C.M.E. Detective Agency makes it their personal mission to foil Carmen Sandiego's plans.

Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? is a game that tests the player's knowledge about geography and general knowledge about different countries. Missions will begin with a treasure being stolen and the player flying to that location. A time limit counts down while they must search the area and interview witnesses to find enough clues to figure out what country the thief flew to next. The player always has a limited selection (usually three or four) of flights available in any given country. This process is repeated until either the villain is found or time expires and they are able to get away.

Along with finding out where the thief has headed, the player must discover who the thief is, by best matching personal characteristics (gender, hair color, eye color, hobbies, notable features) to dossiers on Carmen's gang. There must be enough characteristics matched in order to obtain a warrant, which is essential to legally arrest the suspect once they have been found. Progress in arresting VILE members will expose other members, eventually leading up to Carmen Sandiego herself.</desc>

		<desc>Whizz is one of the few 3D platformers to use an isometric viewpoint. The controls reflect this, with moving the controller to the right actually moving the character down and right, moving it down and right moving the character down directly, and so on. Each level is played out against a time limit, and the paths through the level aren’t always clear-cut. There are four different types of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything you’d logically expect to clear the path). You can avoid the baddies, which may be the best option, as killing them costs you some energy –this reduces the significance of the points system.</desc>

In the first level, the player must drive Benny the Cab to reach the Ink and Paint Club ahead of the Toon Patrol, jumping and swerving to avoid cars and puddles of Dip in the road. The second level is set within the club; here, the player must pick up all the sheets of paper being laid on the tables by the penguin waiters, since one of them is Marvin Acme's will. However, the player has to avoid picking up whiskey drinks or being grabbed by the club's gorilla bouncer. The third level is another race against the Toon Patrol to Acme's Gag Factory, and the fourth requires the player to use various joke items to get past the weasels, stop Doom, and save Roger's wife Jessica from being obliterated by Doom's Dip cannon.

The box includes a short catalog of items available in the final level, providing the player with hints on how to complete the game.</desc>

		<desc>In Wicked, a big evil has come to the world and the player has to drive it back. To do so, the twelve astrological signs (with three levels each) have to be purged. The basic idea is that portals spit out spores which can be either good or evil. The goal is to produce enough good spores to overrun and destroy all evil portals before the screen is filled with bad spores. 

The player has to manage the time resources because everything has to be done manually: shooting at the evil spore growth to drive it back and picking up good spores to create good spore portals at strategically useful positions. Additional gameplay elements are Guardians which fly around the screen and are unhealthy when touched, a night-time-rhythm which influence the spore growth and tarot cards which get revealed in regular intervals. These have either good or bad influences for the one who picks it up. There are three options to set the gameplay: action-oriented, strategy-oriented or mixed.</desc>

Unlike its predecessor the game uses an isometric viewpoint, perhaps because the original FIFA was so popular at the time. A number of vicious moves are on offer, with tackles Vinnie Jones would flinch at along with lethal head-butts and shoulder barges. If a game finishes drawn, it goes into a Ã¢â‚¬ËœPenalty Shoot OutÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, which involves going round shooting the opposition;Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the last team standing wins. The pre-match screens include attacking at defensive play styles, transfers and the chance to buy items such as rocket launchers and shields.</desc>

		<name>Wild Streets</name>
		<desc>New-York, Year 1998. The once most prestigious city in the world, has now become a fighting zone.
Half of the city is left in ruins, and it is in that part of town that the marginals and gangs are living, hunted by every law enforcement agencies. The other half of the city consists of fancy mansions, in some of which the most important drug barons reside.
Unfortunately, they are the ones who run the city using the enormous profits they make from dealing drugs and weapons.
They now have succeeded in endangering the country's economy.

The U.S. government, wanting to avoid a terrible crisis, called the CIA to run several types of operations in order to get rid of this bad substitute of government.
The C.I.A., headed up by "The Boss", has to clean up the city of its crooks.
One plan is to reorganize the city by placing security check-points at strategic positions.
The operation was set up for April 4, and quickly proved to be an unprecedented success.
The badly organized, smaller street gangs, were greatly outnumbered and couldn't match the extremely well armed law enforcement troops.

On May 7, during a successful raid, the state police special branch, took possession of a huge arsenal of weapons and ammunition, worth more than two million dollars.
This raid was an important stage in the whole operation.
Realizing the sticky situation they were in, the heads of the crime organizations now started making plans for themselves: They needed to regain their control over the city and above all, secure their territories.
On May 15, they kidnapped "The Boss" in order to get from him the names of his operatives involved in the C.I.A. fight against organized crime.
This way, they were convinced they could stay in control of the situation and become even more powerful.

Your mission is to liberate "The Boss" and to bring him back safely.

You're gonna be dropped from the chopper with your panther at the spot where "The Boss" was last seen.
You have your 357 Magnum ready and the panther is trained to protect you closely.

You'll have to travel through the various parts of the city, in search of the hostage, and you will find that your street fighting skills will prove to be very useful.

In each part of the city, you will confront various enemies and their gang leaders.
They will become more and more skilled in combat as you progress. Some of them are so powerful that it would be wise to save bullets for these particular fights.
Once you reach the point where "The Boss"</desc>

The player takes control over a single car which can be shown in various camera positions, most prominently directly behind the vehicle or top-down. There are also special fields on the field which grant advantages when passed. 

The single-player portion basically consists of a series of elimination matches with the goal to win all leagues of increasing difficulty levels. Between matches, the points earned with goals can be reinvested into new cars with better statistics - additionally they are also divided into five categories with different roles during the matches. The game features two control modes: in professional mode the player rotates the car when pushing left or right while arcade mode allows direct turns.</desc>

		<name>Wings of Death</name>
		<desc>Wings of Death is a vertically scrolling shoot'em'up with a fantasy setting. You start out as a small insect, flying through a deranged castle filled with hostile animals and monsters.

The upgrade system is rich, and differs somewhat from genre conventions. As you upgrade, your insect turns into a more powerful bat or a mighty dragon. Shooting enemies reveals the various upgrades, and picking up several upgrades of the same kind upgrades that particular weapon level after level. Enemies may also release anti-powerups, marked by a skull. These will downgrade your weapon or draw your energy level.

After fighting the end boss of the castle, a three-headed dragon, you move onto a jungle, a swamp and further... That is, if you survive. Wings of Death has an unparalleled number of bullets and enemy objects on-screen for its time and platform, the maximum number being reported as 95. Coded by former demo programmers, the game also runs in full 50 or 60 Hz scrolling while playing digitised music even on an Atari ST, thanks to inventive hardware tricks used in few other commercial games. It also utilises the extra colour palettes of the Atari STe.</desc>

		<name>Wings of Fury</name>
		<desc>Wings of Fury is an action game with some minor simulation aspects, in which you are the pilot of an American F6F Hellcat plane. The setting of the game is the Pacific during World War II.

It is your job to defeat the Japanese by destroying enemy bunkers, machine gun nests and barracks on a series of islands. Barracks and gun nests can be bombarded with regular bombs, while you'll have to use rockets to take out the concrete bunkers. After a successful bombing run, return to mow down the Japanese soldiers with your machine guns. You also have to sink Japanese battleships with torpedoes and engage in dogfights with enemy fighter planes.

 
You start each mission by taking off from an aircraft carrier, which you'll have to protect from assaults by Japanese torpedo planes. Whenever you run out of fuel, bombs, rockets or machine gun ammo you can replenish those by returning to your carrier. Your carrier is also the place to repair damage to your plane.

The Gameboy Color version of Wings of Fury has a toned down violence level. You no longer mow down Japanese soldiers with your machine guns, instead you bombard jeeps &amp; trucks. Also missing in this version are the Japanese torpedo planes and the small 1st-person view window. New are some extra manoeuvres for your plane like a barrel roll and a review of your ammo consumption after each mission. Using less ammo than allocated gives you bonus points.</desc>

In Downhill skiing, you must avoid the obstacles and make it to the bottom of the hill, by swerving left and right and adjusting your speed by pushing the joystick forward and back. The Slalom is similar, involving skiing around flags.

In the ski jump, you must position the skis for a proper landing. In the bobsled event, you must carefully control the angles so your bobsled doesn't flip. The Biathlon event combines skiing to shooting ranges and shooting the targets archery-style.</desc>

Choose a vineyard in southern Germany, cultivate and harvest grapes, press wine and sell it on the national or international markets. The quality of your wine depends on the type of vines, when the grapes are harvested and how they are fertilized.

You must deal with hiring personnel and buying equipment, registering your wines with the authorities and advertising your products. You can also sabotage your competitors or illegally water down your wines.

You win by reaching a score of 1000 points. Points are awarded by registering wines, creating high quality sparkling wines or placing high in regional or national wine competitions.</desc>

However crashes into the walls or an energy trail loses the match. Random appearing power ups give advantages if picked up, e.g. going through the opponent's trail. The camera is placed behind the shoulder and the screen is always split.

This is all embedded in leagues on different planets. The ultimate goal is to get better and better until the player is invited to an ultimate championship with a great prize. Between matches, the player can upgrade the hoverboard, e.g. adding brakes or a better engine, or bet on the outcome of AI matches. All planets have a difficulty rating which influences the rewarded fame and money for winning.</desc>

		<name>Wizardry : Bane of the Cosmic Forge</name>
		<desc>It is said the the Cosmic Forge is a magical pen possessing an enormous power: whatever is written with it instantly becomes true. A group of explorers ventures into the castle that where the king, the queen, and the wizard who created the pen used to dwell. Nobody knows what has been happening there for the last hundred years, since nobody dares to enter the haunted castle. As the heroes step in, the doors behind them close forever. They are left alone to discover the truth about the Cosmic Forge and the drama that occurred between the castle's inhabitants.

Bane of the Cosmic Forge is the sixth entry in the Wizardry series. While retaining the basic premise of creating a party of up to six adventurers to roam first-person dungeons and fight enemies in turn-based combat, this installment contains numerous enhancements and new features. It is the first game in the series to feature full color graphics and a mouse-driven interface. Combat options are more detailed, with precise weapon moves (such as thrust and bash) available. Magic is divided into six different schools, the spellcaster's powers increasing if he or she concentrates on one of them. Picking locks or disarming traps by thief-like classes is done actively by participating in a simple minigame. Characters can learn skills unique to their class when leveling up. These skills range from weapon proficiencies to field abilities that can be used outside of combat.

In addition to the traditional races of humans, elves, dwarves, hobbits, and gnomes, the player can choose between the Lizardman, the cat-like Felpurr, the canine Rawulf, the pixie-like Faerie, the intimidating Dracon, and the furry Mook. Each race has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as predispositions to certain classes. Exotic character classes such as Valkyrie, Alchemist, Psionic, Ninja, Samurai, and Monk are also available during character creation, though they require a higher amount of bonus points received during the initial dice roll. It is also possible for characters to switch to another class during the course of the game.

Conversations with NPCs have been extended, the player being able to talk about various topics with the same character. The game also features a branching storyline: depending on the player's choice to believe or mistrust a key character, the plot will split into different directions, resulting in several different endings. The entire game takes place within the castle and its surroundings, without</desc>

		<name>Wizball</name>
		<desc>In Wizball the player takes the role of the friendly wizard Wiz who can turn himself into a green ball that is able to defend his world against the color-sucking enemies who have turned his once brightly colored Wizworld into a drab planet. With his trusty feline companion Catelite, the wizard will restore the colors to the world by retrieving them from defeated enemies.

The player starts out as a bouncing green ball that can shoot and be put into more or less heavy rotation to move slowly or faster, physically correct through the side-scrolling levels. The first task is to upgrade the ball by shooting the first non-moving enemies, and collect the green bubbles that are left by them. In order to stand a chance against the following moving enemy waves, some upgrades are a must. First and foremost, complete control over the ball should be activated (i.e. flying through the levels), a shield sheltering the top and bottom of the player's should be acquired, and two-way fire (left/right) should be obtained.

But the extra needed to advance in Wizball is your friend Catelite who will, once summoned, take the form of a small green satellite that will imitate the ball's movement, or can be directly controlled by the player. Besides upping Wiz' fire power, Catelite is able to collect paint drops left by a certain kind of defeated enemies until the respective color pot is filled up. There's three colors available (red, green and blue), and several different combinations of them must be collected to complete a level and restore it to former colorfulness. Every color combination collected will send Wiz to a bonus stage, then to his laboratory where one of the power-ups can be made permanently.

The game also features a bunch of multi-player modes, there's even a two-player cooperative mode amongst them.</desc>

As Saul, it is your job to traverse five different areas on your way to Draxx. When Saul collects enough power-ups, he turns into his wolf form and gains a special psychic shot attack, which can be improved by collecting futher power-ups. However, if Saul loses health, he turns back into his human form and only has his fists to fight the numerous enemies.</desc>

		<name>Super Wonder Boy</name>
		<desc>Eleven years have gone by since Tom-Tom rescued his girlfriend Tanya from the clutches of the evil King. Word of Tom-Tom's dangerous adventure soon spread throughout Wonder Land. The people were very proud of him and gave Tom-Tom the highest honor of all - the legendary name of Wonder Boy. With the evil King defeated, Wonder Land returned to its peaceful state, and for over one decade, the kingdom was a paradise, and everything and everyone lived happily together.

Eventually, the peace was broken when a ferocious fire-breathing dragon appeared out of nowhere and took over Wonder Land with an army of evil, monsterous henchmen, causing Wonder Land was immediately thrown into utter chaos. Defenseless that they were, the people were quickly taken over and the tranquil and serene kingdom was transformed into a land of demons and devils. Wonder Land was now a Monster Land. Tom-Tom was summoned to set out on a journey, destroy this dragon, and restore peace once again. Tom-Tom is Wonder Land's last hope.

There are twelve locations in which Tom-Tom must venture through, including (but not limited to): the city of Wonder Land, Valley of Peace, The Coastal Town of Baraboro, The Mam Desert, and Pororo Islands. During his journey, he must defeat monsters with the sword that he got at the beginning of his adventure. These monsters will leave either gold coins or bags of cash, which he can use to buy better weapons, shields, armors, and boots. At the end of each location, there is usually a boss that Tom-Tom must defeat in order to obtain a gold key that will unlock the exit gate, as well as plenty of gold coins or bags of cash. If he touches any enemies, or is shot at, he will lose health. During his travels, Tom-Tom must take note of the hourglass; if the hourglass display sands at the bottom, he must get another one that appears out of nowhere, or he'll also lose health. There are two ways in which he can restore it. He can either go into bars to have a drink that will restore it and get a hint about what lies ahead as well, or go into hospitals and heal himself to restore the lost health.</desc>

		<desc>Wonderland is a computer text-driven adventure game developed by Magnetic Scrolls and published in 1990 by Virgin Games.

Wonderland is based on Lewis Carroll's classic children's book Alice in Wonderland, with the player taking on the role of Alice. It does not involve anything from that book's sequel, Through the Looking-Glass.

With this game, Magnetic Scrolls introduced a bespoke windowing system dubbed "Magnetic Windows". The player's inventory, the location's graphic, the map and so on are all in separate windows that can be moved and resized independently.[2] (A similar system is used in unrelated adventure games like Deja Vu.) The developers stated they believed it would make the game more accessible, giving it a much wider appeal.</desc>

The game plays out as a regular platformer in which Woody walks through the level, collects power-ups, avoids obstacles (e.g. blocks with nail traps or others which crash when touched) and defeats enemies by jumping on their head.</desc>

		<desc>In World Championship Boxing Manager the player can develop the careers of aspiring heavyweight boxers. The option are selected through an icon-based system, representing the manager's office.

Training the boxers involves deciding which areas they should work on, considering their strengths and weaknesses and any damage inflicted in previous fights, and those of their next opponent. There are 97 of these in the game, so reaching the top of the rankings will take about 15-20 fights. Choosing a beatable opponent who can get the fight as high up the Friday Night bill as possible, as well as negotiating the best financial deal and a mutually agreeable dare, are the main considerations.</desc>

The game uses a top-down perspective for matches and features the full World Cup structure and all the 24 teams who were involved. Multiple formations and team selections are available before each match. The ball sticks to the feet of the players, who can be tackled either by doing a block tackle, or attempting a slide tackle, which risks giving away a foul. Matches can vary between 4 and 90 minutes, and each player has differing skills and behaviour style depending on his team's relative ability.</desc>

		<name>Wreckers</name>
		<desc>Wreckers is an isometric sci-fi action game with strategy elements.

Robotic droids roll quietly through the corridors of space station Beacon 04523N, automated computers calculate routes for interstellar traffic. Three human officers sleep in cryogenic tanks, awakened only for routine system checks – or in case of an emergency. With a hum, the cryogenic control springs on-line as Beacon’s long-range sensors detect incoming lifeforms.

Controlling one of the on-board officers, you have to defend the station against swarms of plasmodian spores (the “Wreckers”) showering down on Beacon and seeping into its four sections. While the spores approach, you can suck them out of space with a gigantic hoover-like space hose. Once they settle onto the stations hull, jump into the space suit and spray infected areas with a cleansing agent. Undetected spores will seep into the station’s corridors, where you must hunt them down with a plasma shots and avoid being shot in return.

In addition, up to ten droids are under your (indirect) control. Ranging from cleaners to fighters to engineers, these automatons will act independently, but can be sent to key locations within the station -- i.e. infected areas. As your officer gains experience through battles, he will be promoted to higher ranks, enabling him to construct more efficient fighter robots in the station’s droid factory.

Since plasmodians running rampant in the station will cause system malfunctions, your main goal is to clear infections quickly and make sure that Beacon continues to function properly. To make things worse, an self-destruct mechanism will explode the station in 60 minutes unless all signs of spore activity cease. 

Effective droid construction and assignment, quick reactions to approaching swarms and good reflexes thus combine into a challenging race against time that makes Wreckers stand out as a clever twist of the “alien invasion” action archetype.</desc>

Combat takes place both in and out of the ring, although you can't spend more than 10 seconds at a time outside the ring. Once you stun an opponent you can throw them, which inflicts real damage to their energy bar. You can make lots of combination moves, including jumping off the ropes and landing on an opponent to pin him.</desc>

		<name>WWF Wrestle Mania</name>
		<desc>At the height of the World Wrestling Federation's European fame came this crunching recreation of the elaborate hammed-up action. Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior or the British Bulldog can come under your control.

You play either in practice matches (against the hopefully-misnamed Mr Perfect) or in a sequence of 5 matches to win the Wrestlemania Belt. Your opponents have different special moves - watch out for The Warlord's Full Nelson and Sgt. Slaughter's Camel Clutch, for example. Before the fights start, your opponents will deliver a taunt, which you must respond to as creatively as possible.

The game is a beat 'em up viewed from a forced perspective above and behind the action. Your aim is to pin your opponent to the ground for 3 seconds, which can only be done once he has been weakened. Kicks, punches and throws will reduce an opponent's strength bar. When a strong opponent is down, stamping on him will pay off more than attempting a pin.

Avoid leaving the ring for too long - 20 seconds out and the match is void, which counts as a defeat. As in real WWF, the frame of the arena can be used to perform moves. Once players are in close contact, waggle the joystick to ensure you win the grapple.</desc>

		<name>Xenomorph</name>
		<desc>You have landed your crippled ship at the Atargis mining station. The platform was deserted and no one answered your radio calls. Now you are forced to enter the station and find a way to get off the asteroid. Hopefully whatever happened to the 200 personnel in the labyrinth of mines under the station won't happen to you too.

Xenomorph is a first person RPG. Like the Dungeon Master series everything happens in real time. You move around in 10 foot steps and can turn 90 degrees. You have two hands to fight and use items with, a belt and holster for quick access to weapons as well as an inventory for carrying things.

The objective of the game is to find parts to repair your ship. You must also find food and water for sustenance and guns, grenades and mines for self defense. Other items can help you during your mission such as environmental suits, security passes and a motion detector. Data disks found throughout the station will fill in the story.</desc>

		<name>Xenon</name>
		<desc>Xenon is the obscure and mysterious predecessor to the much better known Xenon 2: Megablast. The game is actually nothing like its sequel, with completely different control scheme and gameplay. The plot overlaps however, with the Xenites making their first attempt to control the galaxy.

Xenon is essentially an overhead shooter, where the player controls the ship and moves around the screen. However, the difference between Xenon and its sequel is that here the player actually controls the movement of the playfield (up or down) by simply moving the ship in the direction of choice. To do this in the sequel, players need to slam your ship against the bottom of the screen and pull back on the stick in order to reverse-scroll the playfield.

It also features a 3D playfield (some enemies, for example, will be mounted on hills of sort, where players can't shoot them). To combat these the player can transform its tank into a plane. The game then switches to the more familiar gameplay style as seen in other vertically scrolling shooters. The plane has to transform back into a tank again to combat most ground units.

In Xenon, upgrades are taken from destroyed enemies.</desc>

A small band of engineers has been dispatched to combat the Xeno threat before it takes over all the space stations and, eventually, your homeworld.  Assemble your band of engineers and fight the Xenos on each station, striving to either clear it or abandon it.  You start out with a standard issue laser, but can pick up additiona weapons as you find them, including Phasers, Lightning Rifles, Poofer guns, and bombs.

Xenophobe was originally an arcade coin-op by Bally/Midway, released in 1987.  Gameplay premise and setting is heavily inspired/influenced by the movie Aliens.</desc>

		<desc>Viewed from above, the task in each level of X-It is to create a path to walk through to the exit, by moving blocks around a walled arena. The movement physics are fairly true to real life - most blocks can only be pushed if there is a block's worth of space behind them, and nothing immediately ahead of them. 

The levels are full of gaps, through which blocks can be pushed - this has the double effect of freeing up extra room in the level, and allowing you to walk over those spaces. Other hazards include ice which prevents blocks from stopping until they go past it. Falling through holes loses you one of your 3 lives - you also have 5 attempts at each screen.</desc>

Through five levels, you have to shoot countless enemies, complete with the obligatory mid-level and end-level bosses. The most innovative part of this game comes after a level when you get to purchase new weapons - instead of simply buying upgrades, you can customize your ship by placing your new weapons anywhere on it.</desc>

The game environment is much fuller and wider than typical sprite based racers, with full freedom of movement and some Mode 7-style effects. Not only is a course designer included but a sound editor is as well. 

The difficulty level is highly customisable, and the cars don't cheat in terms of artificially keeping up with you or pushing you out of the way and continuing at unabated speed. There are lots of weapons on track to be picked up and fired at will, giving it a Mario Kart feel. Multiplayer options are highly versatile, allowing for up to 8 human players if you link 2 systems, similarly to Super Skidmarks.</desc>

With either one or two players, you must move through a series of Gauntlet-style underground mazes, killing the bad guys and collecting health and other bonuses from flying saucers (underground? SLIGHT logic gap there, methinks).It's designed to be played co-operatively, although bullets from one player can harm the other.

The Xybots are out to stop you, of course, and many have advanced attack patterns as well as bullets to fire at you. Being able to view round corners is useful, allowing you to plan a strategy - often it's good to send one player forward and let the other play the waiting game, as in Gauntlet.</desc>

The game is a flick-screen maze game viewed from a high elevated angle as you control Yogi. You have to search the surrounding areas looking for your friends and toys while avoiding or shooting various creatures. You are armed with sweets to shoot the creatures but these are limited. If you are touched by a creature or certain obstacles then you lose part of a food gauge and when this is empty then it is game over. As well as the toys and your friends, there are other items that can be collected and they are coloured keys to open the same coloured door, cans of pop to double your speed, extra sweets and jars of honey to make you invincible for a limited period. Bubble gum needs avoiding as these will stick you to the spot for a limited time.</desc>

On one search, Yogi over hears an awful telephone conversation with Ranger Smith that the Park is closing and all animals must be caught and transferred to a zoo. Not wanting to live in a cage or enclosure, Yogi has decided to escape and thus the beginning of his adventure. You have to guide Yogi over six levels (ending in New York) keeping ahead of a tracker and his dog. You must complete each level in 2 minutes 40 seconds or it is game over. On the way there are obstacles like holes and water, as well as other characters to get in your way. Touching these loses one of three lives. Scattered over the levels are various food items which will give you 100 points as well as invisible ones giving 250 points. If you want a bigger score then on certain levels you can collect six items which reward you with 7500 points.</desc>

		<name>Zarathrusta</name>
		<desc>Based on the classic Thrust, Zarathrusta is a cave-flying game with orthodox gameplay but an actual story behind it. Apparently, the resistance forces have captured a number of space ships, which could aid in the struggle against the empire. However, these ships need fuel, and that fuel is find in the form of "klyston pods", which must be recovered from a range of hostile environments. 

Your task is to fly your small spaceship above and below ground, capturing the pods. Your spaceship can rotate in 360 degrees, allowing for easy movements through the cavesystems, if it wasn't for gravity pulling you down, and intertia which means you could crash into walls or other objects if you don't turn around and thrust in the other direction. 

Each level is cleared by recovering the klystron pods, which are the same thing as the ball you pick up in Thrust. Pick up the pod with your tractor beam, and a towing line will be attached. Towing the ball means that you have another object altering your course, though; if you break quickly, the forces of intertia will make the ball travel forward, pulling you in its direction. At later levels, the pod becomes heavier, and must be pulled using a force field. Travelling too fast will make the ball slip out of the field, forcing you to pick it up again, possibly from a very dangerous area.

The levels are guarded by cannons, which can be shot down using either your conventional cannon or a laser cannon. Beware, though, for the laser eats up your fuel supplies very quickly. Refueling is possible by activating the tractor beam above the fuel pods stationed throughout the levels.

Whereas Thrust used vector graphics, or something with a similar look, Zarathrusta uses detailed bitmap graphics, making for a different look for a similar game.</desc>

		<desc>With a similar gameplay as the isometric Desert Strike, Zeewolf offers arcadesque helicopter-combat in a 3D-surrounding. Despite its mainly action-oriented gameplay, the 32 levels often involve support, transport and rescue missions - dropping or refueling friendly units in the combat zone, for example. In exchange, other units serve you as rearming points or help you fighting the enemy.

The order of the levels can be chosen freely and the game may be played with joystick or - a little unusual - with the mouse.
Although the range of sight is somewhat limited, the 3D graphics are very appealing and perform smoothly while playing. Here the game uses a 3rd person-engine looking at the helicopter from the side and displaying a certain amount of landmass in a square around it.</desc>

		<desc>At its most basic level, Zero Gravity can be thought of as a Pong game, as the player controls a bat which must be used to hit a ball as it comes towards you. The main twist is that the gameplay is completely 3-dimensional, with control over the horizontal and vertical positions of the bat. The game uses a split-screen view, with the top half viewed from the perspective of Player 1, and the bottom from that of Player 2, even when only one of them is human.</desc>

The player controls a spaceship-like aircraft that is trying to survive amidst the fire of hostile ships and other enemies. There are five stages in the game altogether; each contains a fight against a boss enemy at the end. Small spheres are dropped by enemies; collecting these spheres bestows the player-controlled ship with various power-ups. These include two additional small ships above and below the main one, an ability to shoot backwards, and missiles that can be shot diagonally.</desc>

		<desc>In Zombi you control a team of four intrepid travelers, who have landed their helicopter on the roof of a shopping centre in the hope of finding fuel. The problem is that, with Hell full, Zombies are walking the earth, devouring humans as they please.

Zombi is a point and click adventure game in which you control the four characters (Alexandre, Sylvie, Yannick and Patrick) in turn, taking each of them individually through the abandoned complex. Lots of potentially-useful items have been left behind, some stored in cupboards - work out what they could be used for. 

Try to find a weapon with which to attack the zombies - bare-hands fighting only works for a few attempts before your character is worn out. Dead zombies should be placed in the freezer in the basement to stop them re-emerging. You have free rein over the shopping mall, and can use the bed shops to rest and the food shops for nourishment. Be wary of the dark and zombie-filled basement though.</desc>

Zool 2 is a platform game where you control the titular "Ninja of the Nth Dimension" (or his girlfriend, Zooz, who can complete each level in a slightly different way) as he rampages through a variety of levels, collecting countless tasty treats, shooting any enemies that he encounters and finding bonuses (there's a variety of special power-ups Zool can find - for example, a bomb that follows him and can be blown up at any time to remove on-screen enemies, or a temporary invulnerability). New to the sequel is Zool's ability to scale walls and his new spinning attacks. 

On each level you have to collect a certain amount of the featured fruit within an allocated time limit, and then find the exit across the multi-directionally-scrolling levels. There are lots of hidden areas to see, including a bonus Breakout game starring Zool's pet 2-headed dog.</desc>

Whilst some shoot 'em ups are much easier with a second player, Z-Out takes design steps to legislate against this. In a 2-player game, most power-ups are unavailable, and even those which are only come into effect on level 3. Another variation is that the 1-player mode uses restart points, but the 2-player mode does not, so as to keep both players in the same place.</desc>

		<name>Zyconix</name>
		<desc>Zyconix is an arcade puzzle game.

Colored blocks raining down on a playfield, we’ve seen that before. Zyconix takes the Columns principle (align three or more bricks of the same color to make them disappear) and adds a few twists of its own:

1. First, there are no groups or columns of stones, only single blocks.
2.  Second, several of them slide down at once, and you select and move them with a cursor.
3. Third, only horizontal and diagonal lines disappear, but not stacks of the same color.

Add a few special objects from bombs to drills to a breakout ball that you can actually deflect grabbing a brick as a paddle, mix with four play modes (normal, pre-filled playfield and two time trial variants), and the result is a fast-pasted, tricky test of agility. 

Two players can compete in split-screen mode, where each removed line turns the corresponding number of bricks on the opponent’s field into indestructible obstacle blocks. Soloists adjust the difficulty level by tweaking the number of blocks in a line (from three to six), number of colors and frequency of new stones appearing.</desc>

		<desc>Another World, also known as Out of This World in North America and Outer World (ã‚¢ã‚¦ã‚¿ãƒ¼ãƒ¯ãƒ¼ãƒ«ãƒ‰ AutÄ WÄrudo?) in Japan, is a 1991 cinematic platformer action-adventure game designed by Ã‰ric Chahi for Delphine Software. The game tells a story of Lester, a young scientist who, as a result of an experiment gone wrong, finds himself in a dangerous alien world where he is forced to fight for his survival.

Originally developed for the Amiga and Atari ST and later released for the Apple IIGS and DOS platforms, the game was widely ported to other contemporary systems. Later efforts resulted in several game engine recreations for the game that permitted it to run on modern computers, consoles and mobile phones. In 2006, Chahi independently released a 15th Anniversary Edition for Windows which allowed the game to be played on modern computers with original or enhanced visuals; following up in 2011 for its 20th anniversary, ports of the game were prepared for iOS and Android based devices.

Another World was highly innovative in its use of cinematic effects in both real-time and cutscenes, which granted the game praise amongst critics and commercial success. It also influenced a number of other video games and designers.

Another World is a platform game, featuring a control scheme wherin the player uses either the keyboard, joystick or gamepad to make the protagonist run, jump, attack and perform other, situation specific actions such as rocking a cage back and forth. In the initial part of the game, Lester is unarmed, as he is able to kick at small creatures but is otherwise defenseless.

Later in the game, the player acquires a laser pistol from a fallen foe. The pistol has three capabilities: a standard fire mode, the ability to create force fields to block enemy fire, and a powerful charged shot that can break through force fields and some walls.[3] Eventually, Lester also gains a plasma ball that can be used like a grenade to defeat foes (not featured in the original Amiga release). Enemies also have the same capabilities, requiring the player to take advantage of the three gun modes and the environment to overcome them.

Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and the game ends immediately if either of them is struck by a projectile or comes in contact with an animal or an environmental hazard.[4] However, the game uses numerous checkpoints enabling the player to keep restarting at the last point indefinitely. On the Amiga and older</desc>

There are 11 different enemies to meet you, and Krauer, the Death Bringers leader who protects the ship and is 4 meters tall.

The game starts with a single shot, then the weapon is expanded over the game, we pick up weapons more and more powerful. Note that the contents of the crates sent from the sky by the Astro Marine can be changed by the Death Bringers, so you can die suffocated by green carnivorous plants.

Phase 2 of the game takes you to the Death Bringers ship that drops you on their planet, and you have to exterminate them in a limited time, and contains 13 different enemies and the end boss, Great King Alien.</desc>

		<name>MicroProse Formula One Grand Prix</name>
		<desc>MicroProse Formula One Grand Prix is a racing simulator released in 1991 by MicroProse and created by game designer Geoff Crammond.

One of the first games to implement something that resembled "real world" racing physics, accurate track modelling and car handling that required skills somewhat similar to real-world driving skills to perform well. Also one of the first to offer meaningful options to tune the behaviour of the cars. Although not quite on the level of later simulations, the most important variables, such as gear ratios, tyre compounds and wing settings were available to tune and, more importantly, proved to make an actual difference when driving. Important were also the functional rearview mirrors and an "instant replay" system with a wide range of adjustable camera settings not seen in other games of the era.

The accurately modelled tracks meant that the player could actually recognise their location on the real-life circuit. The detailed physics engine provided a more realistic driving experience than had been seen before, drivers could easily experience the differences in handling depending on how you entered a corner and how soon or late you accelerated out of it. Unlike other racing simulations of the time, the accuracy of the simulation actually made the 1/1000 of a second chronometer meaningful, as races could be won or lost by a few thousandths of a second. Vitally, the combination of graphics and physics meant players could actually "feel" whether they were driving fast or slow, and could predict how the car would respond. Even details such as tyre wear were modelled throughout the race, qualifying tyres are an extreme example of this: players could not drive more than a couple of laps without beginning to lose grip and eventually spinning out on nearly every corner. Together with the 16 tracks and the atmosphere-packed rendition of complete Grand Prix weekends, it made F1GP a favourite with Formula One and racing sim fans for many years, and is still referred to occasionally in current reviews as a classic benchmark.</desc>

However, Lemming Island is now in danger, and you must complete 10 levels for each tribe in order for them to reunite and reassemble the Talisman from the 12 pieces.

Across the 120 levels there are over 60 skills, although no more than 10 are in use on each screen. The Classic tribe has the ones from the original and is perhaps the best option for first-time players.</desc>

		<name>Maniac Mansion</name>
		<desc>The Edison mansion has always been a creepy old house on the edge of town. There have been rumors of strange experiments going on and of odd creatures living amongst the Edison family. There is even a story that a meteorite once crashed near the home nearly 20 years ago. More immediately, a girl named Sandy has gone missing from the local highschool and her boyfriend Dave swears that he saw Dr. Fred abducting her. Dave knows that he cannot do it alone and will need help from two other students if he has any hope of infiltrating the mansion and rescuing Sandy.

Players start by choosing 2 students to accompany Dave to the Edison mansion, and can then switch between these three characters at will. Most actions are carried out by selecting verbs on the screen and applying them to an object (such as "OPEN Door"). Each character maintains a separate personality and may have a different way to solve a problem from his classmates. Thus many of the puzzles can be overcome in different ways depending on the character being used. If any one of the kids are captured by the Edisons, they are thrown into the dungeon and must be rescued themselves by any character who still has their freedom.</desc>

		<name>Qwak</name>
		<desc>In this game, you play a duck and the object of the game is to get the highest score without losing all your lives. This can be achieved by getting all the fruit and gems in the level, or killing off enemies. There are 80 levels to complete and once you complete all of them, the levels are repeated. 

You exit each level by collecting all the gold keys then entering through the door that opens. You have a certain amount of time to complete the level before spikes fall down the level. There are eight areas, all consisting of ten levels. At the end of each area, there is a guardian waiting for you, and again, you have a certain amount of time to defeat them.

You kill enemies by throwing orange-colored eggs at them, and in the earlier levels, they go down in one or two shots, but in later levels, you'll find out that all of them take more than two shots to bring down, so your orange balls would be useless here. The solution is to get a special power-up that will give you chocolate eggs.

Besides gold keys, you can also collect silver keys. This lets you unlock a gate, giving you access to more shots or power-ups. There are also booby traps in the level, such as spikes, and some parts of a level are blocked off by spikes. Get a mushroom and they turn into flowers that you can pick up. Beware, getting another mushroom will make them turn into spikes again. 

Apart from the normal levels, there are challenges where you have to complete a level and get all the fruit as you can under a 20-second time limit. Depending on gameplay, there are  also tricks where the last key you have to get flies away and you have to catch it. Other tricks include turning on the lights to see enemies, and running away from the "happy ghost". You'll receive bonus points at the end of the level if you manage to collect every gem in the level.

Qwak can be played as either a one or two player game. The game was released at budget price, and later on a CD double pack with Alien Breed '92.</desc>

		<desc>The first instalment in the Skidmarks series is a slightly-from-above racer for one or two players in the vein of Super Sprint. There are four different cars to choose from: a rally sports car, a high-wheeled muscle car, a monster truck and a buggy. There are two sets of six tracks each, each track measuring roughly three by two screens in size. Apart from the usual simultaneous two-player option, where both play on the same computer, there is a (null) modem link option, allowing four players to compete at the same time. Additionally, messages can be sent via the serial line, so as to taunt the opposing team. Depending on the available memory, there are either one, two or four kinds of cars partaking in the race.

An additional AGA enhancement disk, for Amiga 1200 and 4000 systems, updates the game to use sub-pixel scrolling and makes the sprites high resolution with greater colour depth.</desc>

(Digital Armoured Virus Exterminator) and eliminate the enemies before it's too late. The levels are split into worlds with four levels each, and each world has its own theme. For example the first world is sport themed so you will drive over football fields, billiard tables and racing courses. 

The gameplay is the one of an isometric shooter, where you roll around the levels and shoot the enemies with one of several weapons. The weapons covers the whole range from fast but not so powerful weapons to more powerful (but slow) like mortars. The action can be enjoyed by one or two players both turn-by-turn or simultaneous where one player controls movement and the other the weapons.</desc>

Rendered in 3D, seems from behind your head.

The game is set in the years 1916 through 1918, and to loosen things up a little, we get to read a page of our character's new entry for the diary-like journal in his company between every mission.</desc>

There are 3 different colours of marbles, which a quota to recover from each level. Collecting enough of each particular colour sees all similar ones turned to coins, which can go towards extra lives and points bonuses. Switches are built into the levels; these act as restart points.</desc>

Football-style tricks of keeping the ball in the air and under control are especially useful - headers and overhead kicks can be played with practice. You gain access to the pieces by collecting 11 Player Cards across each world.

There is a saving feature that gives you the ability to save between each country (but not between individual levels).</desc>

		<desc>Bubble Bobble is an arcade comical action platformer video game by Taito, first released in 1986 and later ported to numerous home computers and game consoles. The game, starring the twin Bubble Dragons Bub and Bob, tasks players with travelling through one hundred stages, blowing and bursting bubbles, jumping on and off blown bubbles to navigate level obstacles, dodging and eliminating enemies, and collecting a variety of items including some that carry 'power ups' and significant bonuses.</desc>

		<desc>Sixteen levels (in four groups of four) await you in this long-developed Bitmap Brothers title. The basic gameplay is similar to Gauntlet, but in an open air setting, with bridges across rivers and such in the maps. The visuals are in the 'metallic and blue' style the Bitmaps appeared to favor.

There were 6 characters available in the game, each with different strengths and weaknesses, and different starting prices. In 2-player mode you each chose a character and played co-operatively, but in one-player games you also choose a character for the computer to control, with its Artificial Intelligence allowing it to open doors, pick up power-ups and take on baddies away from the ones occupying your character.</desc>

Fortunately your Tiny has special powers. It can transform himself into a swimmer, rock eater, fireball spitter, or rope swinger during its quest.

The game takes place on a huge island separated into eight regions: Desert, Lagoon, Forest, Pyramids, Mountains, Factory, Village, and finally the Castle.

For the US release, the title was changed to 'Pac-In-Time'. It's exactly the same game. Only the characters were changed : the not-so-known European Tinies (from the Skweek, Super Skweek, Tiny Skweeks/Brainies/Tinies games) were replaced by the widely known Pac-Man.</desc>

Each of the moves scores a different number of points and if you come last in a particular round you are eliminated.

There are some sub-games too, involving your karate-master holding a shield and defending himself against bouncing balls from both directions, and kicking bombs off the screen before they explode.

The gameplay takes place across worlds themed around particular types of toys, such as sporting goods, candy and aircraft. The levels scroll sideways, although a small amount of vertical movement is included. On each level Pond must collect 2 penguins and reach the exit, although there are usually multiple exits and lots of secret areas to explore. After completing each pair of two worlds (each of which has three sub levels), a boss must be faced.</desc>

		<name>Rise Of The Robots</name>
		<desc>Rise of the Robots emerges from the hype and reveals itself as a good-looking but rather unwieldy beat-em-up. The game, in all of the currently available versions, is just not that good.

In terms of pure beat-em-up action, Rise of the Robots is outclassed by the barely-better-than-16-bit BODY BLOWS games. ROTR is quite poor in the "special moves" area of beat-em-up gaming. The graphics? Well... the animations are good. The characters, when still, look very good too. When moving they are anything but realistic looking. Their movements are jerky and very repetitive. What's different in each version? Not a lot. All of them suffer from the poor control and jerky animation.

The non-AGA version takes less time to install on the hard drive than the AGA version because some of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“cinematicsÃ¢â‚¬Â have been taken out. They're not much of a loss really. This version also looks pretty good considering the number of colors onscreen. It seems to play a tad faster too.

Disappointment is the key word here. The game promised so much and delivered so little. I guess one good thing is that, for once, the PC suffers from the exact same problems.</desc>

		<name>Lotus Turbo Challenge 2</name>
		<desc>This sequel to Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge is again a behind-the-car viewed racing game. It takes in eight distinct circuits, adding surface and weather effects such as desert and snow. Later in the game, you must race through two-way motorways with oncoming traffic, (incorporating civilian cars and trucks), and face tough levels aided by speed and time boost pick-ups.

You are no longer racing directly against other cars or over laps; instead, racing is on time as you have limited time to reach each checkpoint.  Reaching each of these extends your time, and any remaining time is turned into bonus points if you successfully complete the track.

You have two cars at your disposal, which the game chooses automatically for each level, hence the loss of the word 'Esprit' from the title. The Lotus Esprit form the original is joined by a Lotus Elan convertible, which is slower but has better grip. 

You can play through the set of tracks either full-screen or in split-screen mode with another player. On Amiga and ST the game allows you to link two machines, each of which can have two human players. If one player successfully completes one of the 8 courses, all players can continue onto the next one.</desc>

		<name>Worms</name>
		<desc>Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.

Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends. 

There's a lot of weapons available - the standard ones as bazookas (which is affected by the (random) wind settings and gravity) and grenades. The others include a Fire Punch, dynamite, air strikes, and utilities such as ropes and girders.

There are 10 styles of terrain, ranging from forests and deserts to Candy land and the moon (complete with affected gravity). Shots leave craters in the ground, and complex tunnels can be formed.</desc>

		<name>Alien Breed</name>
		<desc>Alien Breed is a top-down science fiction shooter somewhat inspired by the movie Alien in terms of plot and atmosphere. Gameplay, though, was obviously inspired by the Atari arcade classic Gauntlet. The game tells a typical sci-fi story of an alien invasion on the space station ISRC-4. Two space marines, Johnson and Stone, are the only human beings left to clear the base of aliens.

Moving around an alien-infested complex in a top-down view, you must at all times keep an eye not only on your energy level, but also be conservative with ammunition. Though you will find new ammo cartridges strewn around the levels, they are consumed quickly by respawning aliens that may come crawling out of the floors and walls when you least expect it. On the floors, you will also find keys for passing through locked doors. Keys must also be used with care, or you may find yourself locked out of a room containing the remaining keys that you will need in order to complete the level. Other doors are one-way, and will electrocute you if you try to pass it in the other direction.</desc>

Many of the enemies have good hiding places and can emerge surprisingly, Commando-style.

As your only skill is advanced race-driver training, you decide to enter the Saturday Night Races tournament of illegal highway challenges. As chance would have it, you run into an old friend down on his luck. In order to recoup some of his lost wealth, he sells you his prized Lamborghini Diablo at a rock-bottom price. This uses up all but a few thousand dollars of your life savings. Despite your lack of funds, your sights are firmly set on reaching the first division of this competition. To do this, you must start by winning easy races in Division 4, until you have enough skill and money to enter more difficult ones.

When you feel confident enough in your driving abilities, you may try the Division Challenge. If you succeed, you will progress to the next division. Races become more challenging as you progress, but you can buy more sophisticated equipment and win greater prices.</desc>

The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.

These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.</desc>

Wandering through the map, you can visit enchanted places, towns where you can buy equipment or try your luck in gambling, but mostly visited places on the map will be cabins which represents the places where certain enemy beasts are.

		<name>Pinball Fantasies</name>
		<desc>After the success of Pinball Dreams on several systems, a sequel featuring four new tables was created. The gameplay is much the same as the first game, with realistic physics, multi-player options and a high score table to aim for. The tables are Partyland, Speed Devils, Billion Dollar Gameshow and Stones 'n' Bones, taking in a funfair, racing cars, a tacky game-show, and a graveyard. Each one has a range of ramps, combos, light sequences and targets to shoot, as well as general themes which are less influenced by real tables than those in Pinball Dreams.</desc>

These contain ramps, bonus areas and combo sequences to set up. All the artwork were produced in true 256 colors from the ground up for AGA Amigas and the PC, rather than originating in 32 colors on older Amigas.

New to this version is multiball: Pinball Illusions supports up to six balls simultaneously, in which case it switches to high resolution mode. CD versions use CD audio for music.</desc>

		<name>R-Type II</name>
		<desc>R-Type II is a horizontal scrolling shooter arcade game developed and published by Irem in 1989. It is the second game in the R-Type series.

The player controls a ship called the R-9C (or R-9 Custom), which is an improved version of its predecessor game's ship; the R-9. The ship's design was changed slightly, and the wave cannon was given homing capabilities. Two new types of weapons (the Search Laser and Shotgun Laser) were added, bringing the total number of weapon types up to five. A new anti-ground unit bomb was also added to the missile inventory.

Though the number of levels was decreased from the prequel, the number of enemies, their durability, and the number of bullets they shoot were greatly increased. Enemy movements and terrain were also made trickier, bringing the game's difficulty up considerably. The same revival system is used as in the prequel, where the player is brought back to a checkpoint whenever their ship is destroyed.</desc>

		<name>R-Type</name>
		<desc>R-Type is a side scrolling shoot 'em up best known for its extremely tough and strategic gameplay.  You control the R-9 spaceship as it launches a last-ditch effort to repel the evil Bydo empire.

The R-9 comes equipped as standard with a small gun which can only take down the smallest of enemies without firing several shots. By holding down the fire button, it can be loaded up so as to release a large burst of energy, eliminating all but the strongest enemies in its path. From time to time, pods will come flying in your direction. Upon being shot, they release an upgrade. The first one will invariably be the one called "The Force", which is a weapons pod that clings either to the front or the back of your ship, absorbing any enemy bullets or acting as a bumper with which you can fly head-on into them. You can also use it as an offensive weapon by firing it and pulling it back in. Mastering the Force is vital to surviving in R-Type, since it must be used both as protection against bullet clusters, as a remote controlled cannon, and in order to clear the screen from obstacles. Other upgrades give you target-seeking missiles or a bigger main gun. Different gun types, differentiated by their colour, serve different purposes. The blue one sends laser beams bouncing across the screen (good for tunnels), the red one fires straight ahead, and the yellow one follows any walls it may encounter (good for artillery emplacements).

The stages of R-Type are made in an organic style, certainly inspired by H. R. Giger's artwork for the Alien movies. When it came out, it was considered trend-setting since it broke off from the stereotypical sci-fi mould of other shoot'em'ups. In part, the levels themselves are your enemy, which is exemplified by the fourth, where spider-like creatures weave webs that cover the screen and block your path, or levels with intricate tunnel systems. Still, the levels are best handled with a combination of strategy and reflexes, without the memorisation that is required of R-Type's contemporary rival, Gradius.</desc>

		<name>Slam Tilt - The Pinball Game</name>
		<desc>The final Amiga pinball game released by 21st Century is handled by Liquid Dezign, consisting in part of members from the original Digital Illusions team that made Pinball Illusions. After the relative failure of Pinball Mania, the team banded together one last time to send off the Amiga properly. They don't disappoint here. Even print publications agree: SlamTilt was the last game to score higher than 90% in Amiga Power magazine, before they went out of publication.

Included in SlamTilt are four new tables designed from the start for AGA-capable Amigas, meaning the tables look as smooth as ever. The palettes used here are quite a bit darker, thematically, than others. Lots of navy blues, less saturated colors. And Liquid Dezign doesn't pull any punches as far as content, either: all of the tables have multiball modes, ball savers, kickback features, video modes, and more combo bonuses than you can swing a flipper at. (Terrible joke, yes.) The ball looks a lot nicer and actually appears to be rolling instead of simply being a tiny bitmap flying around the screen. Flashers and table lights will appear to illuminate everything else. The dot matrix display above the table is animated really smoothly and has all kinds of fun little videos that play for things like bumpers being hit, or losing your ball.</desc>

One player controlled a helicopter and the other a jeep, with the jeep transforming into a boat when the vehicles passed over water. As well as a host of blaster fodder the game also included a mid-level enemy inspired by the "Goose" enemy from the earlier title Silkworm. Pieces of this enemy would fly onto the screen and assemble into one vehicle before commencing to fire at the players' vehicles. When destroyed the "goose" would drop power-ups.</desc>

Similar to the first Uridium, you face increasing numbers of unfriendly fighter wings and stationary defenses while sweeping over the carriers. The real challenge here is to avoid the many walls on the back of the vessel while you are under attack.
After the exterior has been cleaned from most of the enemy presence you take care of the ships' reactor core in a jump-and-run-like sequence. While floating in a non-gravity surrounding, lower the core's shields and then destroy it.
The game also gives you a number of extra weapons that can be collected by either flying over pick-ups left from dead enemy wings or by catching them after the power generator has been destroyed.</desc>

Players can compete either against computer-controlled Worms or against each other. 

The weapons are more extensive (and destructive) than in the previous game, including the first appearances of the Kenny-on-a-Rope, Concrete Donkey, Priceless Ming Vase, Old Woman and Holy Hand Grenade. Also included is a level editor that allows players to create their own battlefields.</desc>

		<desc>Back to the Future II is a collection of five arcade and puzzle games.

Based on the second installment of the popular Hollywood series Back to the Future, this movie conversion has Marty McFly and Doc Brown travel through time to stop their arch-rival Biff from changing the future. The game consists of five parts, each inspired by one of the movie's most memorable scenes:

1. Hoverboard Chase: A Paperboy clone without newspapers, but with isometric levels and lots of enemies to dodge.
2. Jennifer Rescue: Guide Marty's girlfriend Jennifer out of the house without her meeting one of the four family members. Open and close doors to make the persons go from one room to the next in this top-down puzzle sequence.
3. Beat Biff: A side-scrolling beat-em-up sequence in the tradition of Double Dragon. Fight your way through a grim 1985 by jumping, hitting and kicking at Biff's lackeys.
4. Band Puzzle: Rearrange the mixed-up parts of an animated picture of the school band in this sliding block puzzle. The clock is ticking.
5. Hoverboard Chase 2: Another hoverboard sequence, similar to the first one, only this time set in 1955.</desc>

		<name>Dune II - The Battle for Arrakis</name>
		<desc>Dune II is often considered the first mainstream modern real-time strategy game and established many conventions of the genre. Even though set in Frank Herbert's famous Dune universe, the game is only loosely connected to the plot of any of the books or the films based from them. Controlling either of the three Houses, the player must fight a number of battles against the other Houses. In the early levels, the goal is simply to earn a certain number of credits, while in the later missions, all enemies must be destroyed.

The single resource in the game is the Spice, which must be collected by harvesters. The spice is converted to credits in a refinery, which are then spent to construct additional buildings and units. There are two terrain types: buildings can only be constructed on stone, while the Spice is only found on sand. However, units moving on sand attract the large sandworms of Dune, who are virtually indestructible and can swallow even large units whole. As levels progress, new and more advanced buildings and units are made available, including structures like a radar station, a repair facility or defense turrets and, for units, various ground troops, light vehicles and tanks. Each House can construct one unique special unit, and, after building a palace improvement, can unleash a unique palace effect.</desc>

		<desc>With April O'Neil held hostage by The Shredder's thugs, Bebop and Rocksteady, once again, it's up to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to come to her rescue!  Play as all four of the turtle heroes, rescue April, and then rescue your sensei Splinter from Mecha-Turtles clutches than go after The Shredder deep in the bowels of The Technodrome itself.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an action game based on the late eighties/early nineties cartoon series of the same name. Play as Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael (one turtle only, but the ability to swap between turtles at any time) as you save your friends and battle The Shredder and his cronies. There are no 'lives', as such - when you lose a turtle, he becomes 'captured', and you cannot use him again until you rescue him from a place hidden in the overworld.

Gameplay takes place in two perspectives: a top-down view, which lets you run around and explore buildings, sewers and other places. When entering places from the top-down view, the perspective shifts to a side-scrolling view, where most of the battling takes place. In addition to each turtle's main weapon, sub-weapons (such as shuriken) can be acquired, to use at foes - these have a limited use.</desc>

		<name>Turrican II : The Final Fight</name>
		<desc>Turrican II: The Final Fight is a platformer/shooter as typically seen on consoles, but designed for home computers from the ground up.

Its plot is - naturally - very simple: an evil mega-robot called The Machine attacks the United Planets Ship Avalon 1, slaughtering all who resist. All - except Bren McGuire, who manages to escape and slips into the experimental Turrican bionic armor. As Turrican, he strives to show The Machine who's the boss.

Unlike other games of its type, this game contains three levels of horizontal shooter action in the spirit of R-Type or the developers' own Katakis. Six large worlds are to be explored, where you are basically free to go everywhere you want, since there is no automatic scrolling and the levels are packed with hidden extra lives and weapons. All those levels are very different: the first one in the rock desert is pretty colorful with parallaxing rainbow background and happy music, while the following worlds get darker and darker.</desc>

		<name>Lost Vikings, The</name>
		<desc>Three Vikings, Eric the Swift, Olaf the Stout and Baleog the Fierce, were kidnapped by the alien Tomator, the evil Croutonian ruler, who is collecting unique life forms to display in his gallery. The three Vikings will have to combine their unique skills to defeat Tomator, as well as a vast array of aliens, robots, giant snails, big lizards and more.

The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.

The player controls one Viking at a time, but can switch between them at any point. The Vikings have limited space in their inventory which they can use to keep various items. Each Viking has three health points, and if he loses them all from confrontations with dangers, he dies (some threats kill instantly), and the level must be restarted.</desc>

		<name>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons - Pools of Darkness</name>
		<desc>Pools of Darkness is the fourth of Gold Box series of classic-style AD&amp;D-based role-playing games. The gameplay is quite similar to other games of this type. At the start of the game, the player creates a party of characters (up to 6). Classic AD&amp;D races (dwarf, elf, half-elf, gnome, etc.), character classes (fighter, paladin, monk, wizard, etc.), alignments (Good/Evil and Lawful/Chaotic axis), and statistics (strength, intelligence, wisdom, etc.) are there for the player to choose and adjust. Once the party is created, the player begins the exploration of the city of Phlan. Upon exiting the city, the player explores a top-down map, visiting dungeons and other locations of interest, as well as engaging in combat.</desc>

		<desc>At the end of First Samurai, the Demon King was able to flee back in time to ancient Japan, so our hero follows him back in time, and has 10 levels awaiting him. Unlike the original, each world is split into sub-levels, with a boss at the end of each one, emphasising the arcade side of the gameplay, which still combines hacking and slashing with puzzle-solving.

As in the first game, you start without weaponry but can pick up swords and daggers as you progress through the levels. There are lots of hidden sections as you progress, which open up more of the end sequence to you, as well as several subgames including a shoot 'em up mode.</desc>
