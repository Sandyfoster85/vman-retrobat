		<name>Fire Pro Wrestling Returns</name>
		<desc>Fire ProWrestling Returns is a 2D-graphic based wrestling simulation game. The game has a north-south/east-west-axis movement system. This allows for dual-plane movement rendering it to play like a 3D wrestling game (although the moves are still done in 2D).

The edit mode allows you to create wrestlers, referees and even entire wrestling organizations (with their own ring and logo). This mode features over 1,648 moves and holds you can assign to your wrestlers, and you can then tweak their CPU logic, so as to make them behave as you like when controlled by the computer. 
 
The new features for the Fire ProWrestling series debuting in Fire ProWrestling Returns are North American cage matches, face layering on edit mode, and ring seconds (aka managers) that accompany wrestlers to the ring. It also features over 20 brand new moves, including some reanimations of old moves.</desc>

		<desc>EA Sports' Fight Night Round 3 from EA Chicago lets you make your own fighter, train them up, and literally take on the world.  
 
Start by creating your own champ and customizing how they look, what equipment they have, their fighting style, their weight class, their signature move, and even their own illegal hit. Get equipment and trainers for your fighter to enhance his look and performance. 
 
Then take your fighter to career mode where you'll play fight your way up from the local gym all the way up to five-star venues. Get trainers to enhance your training and boost your speed and power. Play against randomly generated fighters all the way up through the ranks till you beat them in points or to a pulp. Certain fights may get you a bit of extra money as an incentive, or give you a promotional deal, but pick your fights carefully because strategy inside the ring won't matter if you mismanage your fisher outside. 
 
Fight smart during the fight by using the total punch control system to throw the punches you want to by using the analog stick. The total punch control system maps your fists to the analog stick getting rid of the need for senseless button mashing. 
 
You can also play in historical fights like Taylor vs. Hopkins, Gatti vs. Ward, or Robinson vs. Lamotta in the ESPN Classic mode to play in the fights that made boxing history. 
 
Once you've got the computer down for the count, you can play with any fighter or user created fighters or any of the ESPN Classic fights in local multiplayer with a friend. You can also take the fight online and prove your the real champion of the world against any opponent anytime, anywhere.</desc>

Throughout the game's seven chapters, which contain a total of over 60 individual missions, the player's character must use interpersonal skills to charm, intimidate, and otherwise manipulate key residents of the game's Apple City setting. By building relationships with these NPCs, players gain important information and access to new contacts, allowing them to network up the ladder of celebrity and gain even more power and influence. 
 Unlike in the Sims games, players take direct control of their characters in 7 Sins, steering them through more than 20 different Apple City locations and having them meet as many as 100 different NPCs. Each NPC has an individual set of wants, needs, and worries; it's up to players to learn what these are and use them to their advantage. Player characters can improve their social skills with each successful encounter, acquiring a better sense of humor, civility, culture, or other social attribute which could make future encounters even more beneficial.</desc>

Regardless of the mode chosen, once in the air the player will have control over speed, direction, altitude, gun cannon, missiles and special weapon of their aircraft. A new feature from previous Ace Combat games, is the concept of Wingmen and being able to issue simple orders to them in the air. This allows the player to better coordinated group attacks as well as giving each wingman a personality of their own. Additionally, the player as squadron leader will be asked to make decisions ("Yes/No") while flying in the air. Between missions, the story is progressed through a series of cutscenes.</desc>

		<desc>Cookie and Cream are two cartoon bunnies who are on their way home on the night before their clan's yearly moon festival only to find out that the moon has decided to run away, and if Cookie and Cream aren't able to find it, there will never be another festival. Fearing this, the duo sets out to make sure that it doesn't come true. 
 
The Adventures of Cookie &amp; Cream is designed for cooperative gameplay with two players. The goal of each level is to get to the end in a limited amount of time.  
There is basically a straight road from A to B where the players have to overcome obstacles in their way. This includes standard platforming or puzzles which need both players to solve, e.g. one has to press a button so that the other can progress. Because the way is not the same for both characters the game uses a split-screen view. Power-ups increase the time limits but certain obstacles decrease it again if touched. There are overall 35 levels. 
 
It is possible to play the game alone but then the player has to control both characters at once. The game also features a unique 4-player mode where each character is controlled by two people and one joypad.</desc>

		<name>Aggressive Inline</name>
		<desc>Borne in the same vein as titles such as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and even Z-Axis' own Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX, Aggressive Inline is an extreme inline skating title with an emphasis on tricks, combos, and outlandish stunts. The game offers ten professional skaters to choose from in addition to a handful of original characters. In Career mode, players can select a virtual avatar from the likes of Jaren Grob, Taig Khris, Chris Edwards, Franky Morales, Sven Boekhorst, Sam Fogarty, Matt Lindenmuth, Matt Salerno, Eito Yasutoko, and Shane Yost and take him through seven levels, with the aim of improving skills and attributes along the way. 
 Each character has a rating in seven different categories, ranging from jump to speed to wallride. By repeatedly performing specific tricks and moves, the relative attributes will gain more character points than other less-used attributes. Continued use of specific moves will thus improve the skill of your chosen skater.</desc>

The main creatures he transforms into are a Werewolf, a Merman, a Garuda, a Wendigo, a Fire Minotaur, and a Thunder Dragon.  
Its storyline differs from the original Altered Beast games where during the game, you gain a serum that allows you to change at will.

 Familiar characters return, and players will still find the games' assortment of unlockable power-ups and special equipment as useful as ever, but in Pumped &amp; Primed they may spend as much time racing through platform levels and duking it out in chaotic melee battles as they will sneaking up on escaped apes.  
 Ape Escape: Pumped &amp; Primed offers two main modes of play. The "Story" mode leads players through over 40 levels of athletically themed action, with eight boss battles. The "Versus" mode is designed for two to four (with a Multi-tap accessory) players, and presents more than 20 tournament-style party game challenges.</desc>

A large arsenal of gadgets can be used to make it all a little easier, with the catching net being the most important weapons of them all. Other gadgets include a RC Car, to drive over monkey's and collect objects, an Ape Radar, to detect the nearest monkey, a baseball bat, to hit monkeys unconscious, and a magnet, to move certain objects in the maps. 
 
Your quest is to catch all monkeys in the levels and to stop the evil Specter from taking over the world. All monkeys in the levels are somewhat unique with their own character abilities and their unique name. Some monkeys just sit on their place, while others attack you with projectiles or run away quickly.</desc>

Even the previous heroes of the series - Jimmy, Spike, and the professor - are all caught up in the insidious TV shows.

Kei and Yumi take the lead as the new heroes. Their quest is to capture all 400 monkeys. You control either Kei or Yumi. The gameplay involves using various methods and weapons to catch them all. The game has many levels with different themes, such as a Haunted Castle, a Racing level, Jungle settings, TV studios and other settings. You can slow the animals down with various objects such as a stun club or a slingback shooter, and then you can capture them with a net. 

New to the series are the morphing abilities, eight in all. You can morph into various characters, like a knight and perform a powerful attack or a gun fighter and shoot em up or a ninja and run along walls. You can also vehicles such as a race car to knock down the monkeys. Other features are the familiar Monkeypedia and the unlockable Mesal Gear Solid mini-game (a Metal Gear Solid spoof).</desc>

Frylock had been admitted into the prestigious and exclusive Jersey Pines golf course... while Shake was rejected (he didn't actually apply, but that doesn't stop him from complaining about it). So, Shake decides to challenge Frylock in a game of golf just to prove that he's just as worthy as Frylock to be playing on that golf course. Who cares that Shake has no clue how to play golf? He's angry. 
 
The game plays like a mix between a quite simplified golf simulator, an action game and has golf cart racing elements thrown in for good measure. 
 
The game features lots of extras as well, such as 4 full episodes of the show (one of which is unaired), artwork and movie clips.</desc>

Viruses born in the Altar of Apostles have begun to appear, though normally not in physical form have now taken on the form of monsters and could destroy the world.

Players become a hunter who must travel the world and take on jobs, usually revolving around taking out enemies in real time using magic and special abilities. Collect cards from battle and events and equip them to gain new skills, all the while following an RPG-like storyline. You view the action from overhead, with a camera zooming in and out depending on the intensity of the action and occasionally switching to other angles for dramatic effect. You attack enemies in real time, tapping X once for a simple attack and repeatedly for a combo. You can also guard against attack, dash at an enemy, and press a button to run about the play field faster. The game places heavy emphasis on magic use, with the magic meter recovering automatically and quickly following each spell.</desc>

		<desc>Arc: Twilight of the Spirits is the fourth entry in the Arc the Lad series. Like its two immediate predecessors, the game has tactical battles which allow free positioning and movement of the characters on the combat field. However, the game is closer to being a "regular" Japanese-style role-playing game rather than a tactical RPG. The player controls a relatively small party (up to six active combatants), and is able to explore towns and dungeons in a standard RPG fashion. In the beginning, the game puts the player into control of Kharg, but afterwards the chapters alternate between the human hero and Darc, each with his own party. Characters can use a variety of techniques, accumulating SP (spirit points) in battles and them using them to learn special attacks.</desc>

		<name>Area 51</name>
		<desc>Inspired by the 1995 coin-op by Atari Games, which featured alien-blasting action with a light gun peripheral, Area 51 on PlayStation 2 once again finds players deep within the mysterious military base. Players assume the role of Lt. Nick Cross, a biohazard expert sent to investigate the strange happenings inside the famed research center. Cross soon resents his assignment, however, after being infected by a virus of alien origin. Now he finds himself slowly developing new abilities as a result of the alien DNA strands bonding with his own. Area 51 has been redesigned as a first-person shooter without the weapon peripheral, meaning players are free to explore the top-secret installation on their own without following a scripted path. 
 Of course, players will be armed to the hilt with high-powered rifles, infrared sights, grenades, and various other tools of the trade. Along the way, secrets will be revealed in the areas of alien autopsies, cover-ups involving lunar landings, and experimental work on advanced technology like cloaking devices. With newfound superhuman strength and other biological enhancements courtesy of the virus, Nick Cross must battle aliens, soldiers, and other surprises while also solving puzzles. Area 51's creatures were designed by Stan Winston Studio, the effects team behind such films as Aliens, Predator, and Jurassic Park.</desc>

		<desc>The genuine sequel to the original Armored Core. Thrown into the world of AC mechs, you must complete the objectives set for you by a range of different companies, each with a hefty pay packet attached. If the mission is completed, the money goes towards upgrades and repairs to your mech. 
 
The collection of items to upgrade your mech is fully stocked with weapons, defense systems, rocket packs and guidance systems to increase accuracy and speed. Certain missions require a particular upgrade for the mission to be completed correctly, so spending the cash wisely is important to your career. 
 
Once your mech is ready for battle, you can also take on a friend in arena mode, where one-on-one battles rage on for as long as you wish in huge outdoor areas.</desc>

Through 15 stages, you engage in fast paced all-action gameplay that features multiple mission objectives. Shoot your way through Colombian drug lords, Russian mobsters, and even dirty cops. Sometimes you will need to protect your computer controlled partner or collect some evidence.  You can often duck behind a wall or around a corner, from where you will be able to pick off your targets with less chance of being hit. You will be accordingly rewarded on your successful actions and achievements on a "Bad Boy" rating system. You can follow all the laws and avoid unneccesary damage or take the opposite approach and be a Bad Boy. There's a good amount of different weapons from pistols and shotguns to automatic assault rifles and grenades. Environments are fully destructable. You can use a quick aiming and shooting Action mode, or search for clues and evidence using the Explore mode.</desc>

Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II can be played solo or cooperatively with one other player, each choosing from 5 playable characters. The gameplay is the same as its previous incarnation: kill monsters and bad guys to collect treasure, items, and experience. By talking to townspeople in Baldur's Gate the player can learn of optional maps filled with more dangerous monsters and additional treasure. Equipment can be enchanted by the player this time, and given various magical effects such as additional fire damage, absorbing mana, or boosting stats.</desc>

		<name>The Bard's Tale</name>
		<desc>The Bard is a cynical, opportunistic musician who roams the country in search of carnal pleasures. However, this impatient and selfish fellow is compelled to accept the greatest quest of his life: save the princess Caleigh from a demonic cult that has kidnapped her. The unlikely hero must now explore the land in search of the princess, accompanied by the omnipresent Narrator who obviously can't stand the Bard and uses every opportunity to sarcastically comment on his actions. Furthermore, Fionnaoch, the mysterious abductor of the princess, does everything he can to stop the Bard, sending his minions after him. 
 
A self-proclaimed "quest for coin and cleavage", The Bard's Tale is an action RPG that is more of a whimsical take on role-playing games than a remake of the classic series. As the Bard, players can fight off hordes of foes with blade and bow, and summon companions through magical Bard Songs. Leveling up allows the player to raise the character's main attributes and invest specialization points in the different types of weapons he can use. Magical companions must be sought out and then summoned during battles. After being summoned, they act pretty much like AI-controlled party members; some of them specialize in physical attacks and offensive spells, while others can heal the hero. 
 
During conversations the player can choose "nice" or "snarky" responses for the protagonist. While mostly used for humorous effect, some of these responses may affect subsequent events. The game uses the Dark Alliance engine and has a similar camera and control scheme.</desc>

		<name>Biker Mice from Mars</name>
		<desc>On Mars, a battle wages on between the race of mice, known as the Martian Freedom Fighters, and the invading Catatonian Empire. Both sides are fighting for the rights of one important machine: the Regenerator. This machine has the ability to terraform Mars, creating a safehaven for all mice. The Catatonians wish to claim it so they can take over the planet. Freedom Fighter General Stoker is the only one who knows how to build the Regenerator. As a result, he is not present on the battlefield, but is instead on Earth looking for molecules vital to the device's construction. 
 
The mice later mysteriously lose contact with Stoker, so another general, Carbine, sends the Biker Mice from Mars. After their arrival, they land in Chicago and meet up with Charley Davidson, who runs and owns the Last Chance Garage, which becomes the Biker Mice's base of operations. Not long afterwards do they realize the Catatonians, led by General Hairball and Cataclysm, have come to Earth in search of Stoker, so that they can ensure their claim of the Regenerator. Evil billionaire Ronaldo Rump (a parody of Donald Trump and Ricky Ricardo with an oversized butt) also seeks Stoker, since he owns a Regenerator of his own, and uses it for his evil money-making schemes, but it is running low on power.</desc>

		<desc>Newton's third law is put to the test in Black, a first-person shooter from the development team behind the acclaimed Burnout franchise. Players are cast in the role of Jack Kelar, member of an elite tactical squad, whose team is assigned to Eastern Europe on a hunt for an American traitor. Rather than slinking through environments making quick, covert strikes, players in Black perform a full-on assault through nine levels of explosive action. 
 A total of 13 cutting-edge weapons are available to eliminate the enemy threat, but the most distinguishing aspect of Black is its physics engine: fully destructible environments allow players the freedom to shoot inanimate targets as well as live ones. Instead of firing at a patrol of soldiers, for example, players can instead target nearby vehicles or barrels to trigger explosions, shoot out windows and balconies, and more. As Kelar blasts through the besieged cities, snow-covered wilderness, and other levels, shell casings, glass, dust, and debris will fly across the screen as plumes of smoke and raging fires dot the war-torn landscapes.</desc>

The player controls from behind Kain's shoulder and can move him in different directions, attack, jump, use "dark gifts" and grab on to ledges. Kain's life energy steadily depletes and must be replenished constantly by drinking blood. Blood is found by consuming any living creature nearby, often requiring defeating an enemy through combat first. As Kain consumes blood, his meter is filled up. Once full, Kain gains additional health. Kain also learns new dark gifts throughout the game, by defeating boss creatures. Some gifts include: the ability to blend into mist, fire projectiles, use projectile telekinesis or make a great horizontal leap. Many of these abilities can be used to perform "stealth kills" which will instantly defeat a foe. Kain will fight using his bare hands, or by picking up daggers, swords, axes and other weapons. These weapons all attack differently, eventually breaking, and can also be thrown at enemies from afar.</desc>

		<name>Bloody Roar 4</name>
		<desc>During the XGC (X-Genome Code) Incident one year ago, riots raged over the earth by beasts that did not show the XCG, and all over the country small earthquakes shook the land. The cause was unknown, but as the Crest Incident came to an end and the rioting and earthquakes subsided, people began to claim that all was due to the influence of the Stone Seal. Although the Stone Seal has been locked away, the rioting and earthquakes have returned. This time, the incidents are on a larger scale than those of a year ago. What could be behind it all?    Bloody Roar 4 is the last title in the series, and is once again a full-3D fighting game featuring the series' trademark transformation abilities. Unlike previous titles in the series, the beast gauge now acts as its own health bar; if a character's health gauge is depleted, they will automatically transform. The game features 18 playable fighters and a variety of game modes, including standard arcade, versus, time-attack, training, and survival modes. Of special mention is the career mode, in which fighting battles will earn so-called "DNA points," which can be spent on abilities and equipment to customize a character for use in other modes.</desc>

		<name>Bomberman Hardball</name>
		<desc>Bomberman Hardball is divided into four games. Battle mode (the standard Bomberman game), is joined by tennis, golf and baseball games. At the center of all this is the Living mode, a character building feature in which the player can design a Bomberman for use in any of the battle modes. 
 
Battle Mode is the centerpiece of this and all other Bomberman games. This mode is essentially the standard Bomberman formula; in the game, players navigate grid-based mazes, planting bombs in an attempt to hit other players (while avoided being hit by a bomb themselves). There are several different variations of Battle Mode, although they all center around the standard Bomberman gameplay. 
 
Classic Battle: A standard deathmatch-type game. 
Star Battle: Collect the most stars. 
Crown Battle: Find the crown in the level to win the game. 
Point Battle: Earn the most points by killing opponents 
Replay: Watched game sessions saved to memory card.</desc>

		<name>Breath of Fire : Dragon Quarter</name>
		<desc>Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter is a radical departure from the previous titles of the Breath of Fire series, and in some ways from standard Japanese-style role-playing games in general. The game is built like a huge dungeon crawler, with no overworld map. The combat is tactical: each character has action points (AP), which can be used to move around the screen during an enemy encounter, and perform a variety of combo attacks. There is no magic in the game, and many of the items found in dungeons are random. All the enemies are visible on screen. Depending on who first initiated a physical contact, the party or the enemies get an extra turn in battles. 
 
The game allows (and even encourages) the player to restart it from the beginning, keeping the items and the party experience. The game also features a special counter - Ryu can use his traditional dragon transformation abilities, but the counter raises with each such transformation, and when the counter reaches 100, the game is over. Raising the D-ratio allows characters to access new areas every time the game is replayed.</desc>

		<path>./Broken Sword - The Sleeping Dragon (Europe, Australia) (En,Es,It).gz</path>
		<name>Broken Sword : The Sleeping Dragon</name>
		<desc>Broken Sword - The Sleeping Dragon is an adventure game released on Windows, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 in 2003, while in Japan, the PlayStation 2 version (released only in Europe and Japan) was released in September 2004. A Nintendo GameCube version was planned, but was cancelled. It is the third instalment in the Broken Sword series, released six years after the previous instalment, The Smoking Mirror. The Sleeping Dragon moved the series to 3D graphics, and is the only game in the series not to use a point and click interface. The player assumes the role of George Stobbart, an American patent lawyer who flies to the Congo to write a patent for a scientist who claims to have found a source of unlimited energy. 
 The idea was first discussed in 2000. To make the game feel like a film, Revolution brought in a cinematic consultant, Bob Keen, who made sure the game conveyed emotions and atmosphere appropriate for each scene. The game was originally planned to have similar cartoon-quality visuals as its prequels, but the developers decided to aim at a style similar to Japanese animated films. Unlike the first two Broken Sword games, which used the Virtual Theatre engine, The Sleeping Dragon was built with the RenderWare engine. The game's music was composed by Ben McCullough, and Rolf Saxon returned to voice George Stobbart.</desc>

		<name>Brothers in Arms : Earned in Blood</name>
		<desc>The story is essentially told as a "reflection" on the events that took place earlier, as Army historian Colonel S.L.A. Marshall is interviewing paratroopers 15+ days after D-Day. The story is divided into three parts. The first part of the game is recollection of Hartsock's time in Sergeant Matt Baker's squad during the initial D-Day invasion. The second part picks up when he takes command of 2nd Squad, 3rd Platoon during the liberation and defense of Carentan, and the eventual link up between 82nd and 101st Airborne Division at the town of Baupte. The final part will take place in and around Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte. Although the first part takes place under Baker's command, every mission is one not included in Road to Hill 30. The player commands Desola, Allen, and Garnett from 3rd Squad, and some soldiers from 2nd Squad at first. Then the game switches the player to command the entire 2nd Squad after the Battle of Bloody Gulch (Hill 30). 
 
Hartsock's squad consists of the remains of the original 2nd Squad (Cpl. Franklin Paddock, Pvt. Dean "Friar" Winchell, and Pfc. James Marsh) and the remnants of 1st Squad (Cpl. Jacob Campbell, Pvt. Will Paige, and Pvt. Derrick McConnell). In addition, the player will also be in command of Corporal (later promoted to Sergeant) Seamus Doyle of the 82nd Airborne during the initial D-Day invasion in early parts of the game.</desc>

		<name>Bully</name>
		<desc>Bully is a subtle sandbox game set in a school environment. The player takes control of teenage rebel James "Jimmy" Hopkins, who from the opening cutscene is revealed to be a difficult student with a disruptive background. The game concerns the events that follow Jimmy being dropped off at Bullworth Academy, a fictional New England boarding school. The player is free to explore the school campus in the beginning and, later on in the game, the town, or to complete the main missions. The game makes extensive use of minigames. Some are used to earn money, others to improve Jimmy's abilities or get new items. 
 
School classes themselves are done in the form of minigames, broken into five levels of increasing difficulty. Each completed class brings a benefit to gameplay. English, as an example, is a word scramble minigame, and as Jimmy does well in this minigame, he learns various language-skills, such as the ability to apologize to police for small crimes. Chemistry also an example, is a button pushing minigame, and if Jimmy does well, he gains the ability to create firecrackers, stink bombs, and other items at his chemistry set in his room at the dorm.</desc>

		<desc>In Burnout Revenge, players compete in a range of racing game types with different aims. These take place within rush-hour traffic, and include circuit racing, Road Rage (where players cause as many rivals to crash as possible within a time limit, or until the player's car is wrecked), Burning Lap (a single-lap, single-racer time attack mode), Eliminator (a circuit race where every thirty seconds, the last-placed racer's car is detonated; the race continues until only one racer is left), and Crash (where the player is placed at a junction with the aim of accumulating as many "Crash Dollars" as possible). A new gameplay feature in Burnout Revenge is the ability to ram same-way small to medium traffic, known as "traffic checking", propelling the rammed car forward; the event in which a "checked" car hits a rival is considered as a Traffic Takedown. Traffic checking is the focus of a new race type, Traffic Attack (whereby a player must earn a set amount of Crash Dollars through checking traffic), which can be used later on.</desc>

After his betrothed, Sara, was kidnapped and taken to a large castle, Leon asked the Church for permission to command his underlings to attack the castle. Because of the Crusades going on in the East, he is denied such. But because of his love for Sara, he denounces his title and leaves, going with no weapon or clue to the castle. He is stopped by an alchemist named Rinaldo, who was once a vampire-hunter himself. He gives Leon the Whip of Alchemy, offers to help him further in his quest, and sends him on his way.</desc>

		<name>Circus Maximus : Chariot Wars</name>
		<desc>Circus Maximus is a racing game that takes place in ancient Rome, and as such you'll be racing chariots around various tracks, including the famed Colliseum. 
 
You'll be in control of both the driver and your partner, the warrior, whose job is to attack the other racers to make them fall over.  Chariots are controlled by whipping horses and trying to balance an on-screen meter that keeps your chariot balanced while taking turns fast. 
 
There are four different race modes available; Training, which gives you the basics on how to play, Arcade, which is your standard race, Multiplayer, which lets you face off against three friends (or foes), and Career, which tracks your progress over a period of time. 
 
There are seven different environments and 19 tracks, all set throughout the Roman Empire. 
 
Each course is littered with obstacles, power ups, weapons, and special moves, designed to give you an edge in combat.</desc>

In the distant future, a solar system called Theophilus is once again attacked by a mysterious alien race, called "the menace". The brave bounty hunter Sho, who wields a special sword which he can also use as a gun, is determined to put an end to the invasion. During his adventure he encounters a girl named Feanay, who will help him on his journey.

In this action game you control both Sho and Feanay. Some of the missions can be accessed by both characters, while some are available only to one of them. Feanay uses energy pistols and dual laser swords as weapons. Both Sho and Feanay use the so called "neo-psionics", which are the magic spells of the game. There are also slight role-playing elements in the game. Defeated enemies drop special items that can be later used to upgrade your weapons. You also gain set amounts of experience points after missions.</desc>

Dr. Kosugi, a scientist working for the A.R.M.A. corporation, has created three "mutanoids" - powerful bio-engineered fighters who regard him as their father. When they find out that Dr. Kosugi is missing, they venture into the dangerous areas of the city to bring him back and punish the culprits.

Crimson Tears is an action game with role-playing elements. Controlling either of the three protagonists (Amber, Kadie, or Tokio), each with their own strengths and weaknesses, the player explores randomly generated, enemy-infested stages, disposing of the foes in combo-based hack-and-slash combat. Experience points are gained from battle victories, allowing the characters to level up and become stronger.

Weapon components can be collected from fallen enemies and combined to make new weapons. Like the characters themselves, weapons level up, increasing in attack power and reducing the necessity to repair them. The protagonists have access to ranged attacks, blocks, and powerful area attacks. The player should also keep an eye on their temperature meter, preventing them from overheating.</desc>

Denton, a cybernetically augmented agent of the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO) who is up against National Secessionist Forces (NSF), re-packaged Triads and the shadowy underground known as Silhouette.</desc>

		<desc>Half Man. Half Demon. Pure Vengeance. Legends tell of two millennia ago, in the darkest reaches of Hell, a demon swordsman named Sparda awoke to justice and a rebelled against the devil to wage a one-man war to save the human world from damnation. Now, 2000 years later, a dark figure named Dante finds clues that the Devil is rallying to rise up again against mankind. Who was Sparda and how does Dante fit into this gothic puzzle? Deep within Dante's blood lies the power of ancient demons and the key to defeat the hordes of the dark realm. Somewhere between a man and a demon lies our only chance for salvation. If he succeeds, even the Devil May Cry.</desc>

		<name>Dirge of Cerberus : Final Fantasy VII</name>
		<desc>Set after the events of Final Fantasy VII and the Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children movie, Dirge of Cerberus lets players take the role of the mysterious Vincent Valentine. 
 
After a new organization arises from the events known as "Meteorfall", Vincent is called to the surviving town of Kalm by Reeve Tuesti, an old ally who controlled Cait Sith. Vincent has been invited to the town's celebration, but during the festivities, a group of soldiers attacks the town, killing and capturing the people. It is up to Vincent to protect the innocent once more, and find out why these soldiers are also after him. 
 
While set in the world of Final Fantasy VII, Dirge of Cerberus is an action shooter that runs through twelve chapters. The on-screen action can be controlled by the analog controller, or via the Playstation 2's mouse and keyboard accessories, making it more in line with PC-style shooters. Being a character driven shooter, the perspective can be changed from first to third person on the fly to navigate through the multi-level environments. 
 
Several items and characters from the series make their return, as well as the Chaos break limits system, which allows Vincent to take the monstrous forms he changed into from Final Fantasy VII to inflict more damage on the enemy. Taking a nod from its RPG-based parent, the game does allow Vincent to find the usual healing items, materia spells and gil from the Final Fantasy universe, in which he can buy and sell for other new items. 
 
The game also features a weapon customization system, which allows the player to mix and match weapon parts to form more powerful attack items and abilities.</desc>

		<desc>After a two-year sleep, Prince Laharl awakens to find his father, King Krichevskoy, dead and the Netherworld in the middle of a civil war over who takes the throne. Not willing to give up his rightful place as the next king, Laharl joins with his subordinate Etna and her underlings to fight back. 
 
Disgaea is a tactical role playing game. Battle gameplay takes place on a map divided into a square grid. The player controls a squad of humanoid units and monsters, which each occupy a single square of the grid and do combat with a group of enemies. Depending on the character and attack selected, the player will be able to deal damage to a specific enemy unit or a designated region of the map. Combat ends when all enemy units or all of the player's units are destroyed. 
 
Humanoid characters may lift and throw other units across the map in order to allow allies to move further or force enemies to keep their distance. This even allows the player to capture enemies by throwing them into the base panel; these enemies then become allies, and can be used on subsequent maps. The chance of capturing an enemy in this manner depends on several factors. Failure to capture the enemy will result in the death of all characters inside the base panel, and the enemy will survive.</desc>

		<desc>In order to lift the curse placed upon the inhabitants of Veldime 15 years prior, the protagonist's mother attempts to summon the evil Overilord Zenon so that her son Adell can defeat him and lift the curse. Instead his daughter, Rozalin is summoned, and Adell commits to returning her home to her father, as well as to defeating her father when they find him.  
 
The game is a turn-based strategy RPG in the vein of Final Fantasy Tactics. Classes gain abilities by gaining character levels, and can level up those abilities through use. New items and equipment can be bought or won in battle, and can be powered up up by entering and winning battles inside a given item. Characters can also "gang up" on enemies by performing combos that are activated by positioning other characters near an attacking character. This action only uses the attacking character's turn, leaving the others free to attack again. Clever coordination can have characters attacking quite a few times per turn. New characters can be created (or even reborn as other classes or just more powerful versions of the same class) by petitioning (or even bribing with special items) the Dark Assembly with "Mana" you earn by defeating enemies.</desc>

First team to get the other team out is the winner, be it through the one-shot system or a "life system" where the object is to lower the opposition's players health to zero. If both teams are still in by the end of the game, the team with the most players wins the game. If teams have an equal amount of players left then the team with the least damage taken wins. If equal damage has been taken by either team then the game ends in a tie. 
 
Play as one of six teams who each represent a certain country, spearheaded by a figure from history or national folklore - Japan (Nobunaga), Germany (Bach), Greece (Pythagoras), Norway (King Harald I), Great Britain (King Arthur) and the United States of America (Wyatt Earp). There are three other teams to unlock as the game progresses. 
 
Either play through the single-player World Tournament to become Dodgeball World Champion, play against a friend in a Team Battle, or team up with up to three friends for a Multi-Player Battle against the computer.</desc>

		<name>Drakengard</name>
		<desc>Drakengard follows the story of a kingdomless prince named Caim who fights for the Union against the Empire. Under the Union's protection are the Hierarchs and the Goddess, currently Caim's sister Furiae, who is a human manifestation of one of the four seals that protect the world from being broken. As the game begins, Cain is fatally wounded in a battle with the Empire. Encountering a captured Red Dragon who is also near death, Caim makes a fateful choice. In exchange for both their lives, the Red Dragon and Caim will enter a pact. This pact will forever chain their lives to one another and link their souls, at the cost of something irreplaceable. Recharged with the fires of a Dragon, Caim's vengeance burns over the enemy... 
 
The player controls Caim on his quest. The game is separated into three distinct modes: Aerial combat, Ground combat and Event Combat. In Aerial Combat, Caim rides dragonback against a variety of airborne foes breathing fireballs (strong single shots and weaker multiple lock-on shots). The Dragon is agile and is able to evade incoming threats, turning around completely in a moment. In Ground combat, the game is shown in 3rd person though usually large, open areas. Controlling Caim, his primary ability is the use of a variety of weapons found on the battlefield. These are leveled up through continued usage, and specifically through the killing of individual enemies. Though magic (determined by weapon choice), timed attacks and evasion, Caim breaks through enemy armies. Characters recruited as allies by Caim can also be summoned during battles, steadily losing health until control is returned to Caim. In ground combat, Caim may also call forth his Dragon to ride and strafe enemies from the air. The Dragon's movements are generally the same as in aerial combat but more limited and less agile. Event combat is similar to Ground combat, but shown isometrically, restricted to a single weapon and without the aid of a dragon. It is used mainly to tell story sequences. 
 
Levels that have been visited before might become "Expedition Missions" which are optional and contain new objectives, enemies and weapons. Additionally, any level previously played in the storyline may be revisited at any time. Depending on Caim's choices (and prerequisites for those choices), there are five different endings to Drakengard.</desc>

		<name>Drakengard 2</name>
		<desc>This sequel to the Square-Enix action game continues the multifaceted air and ground combat of the original. Drakengard 2 (known as Drag On Dragoon in Japan) takes place 18 years after the events of the original. The whereabouts of the original's hero, Caim, are unknown to anyone. A new young knight called Nowe serves as the playable main character. Together with his dragon, Legna, Nowe takes part in land and air-based battles, just like in the original, albeit with more refined gameplay. The kill-all mechanics and upgradable weapons of the original return with this title, with the promise of faster action. While on the ground, the game now lets you change freely between characters, with no limit. You'll want to switch characters in order to best match the enemy at hand. Other additions include new mega attacks while airborne.</desc>

		<path>./Drive to Survive (USA).gz</path>
		<name>Mashed - Drive to Survive</name>
		<desc>Mashed is an action-packed top-down arcade-racer. On 13 tracks (which must be played free in single-player first) you need all your driving skills to survive and make it to the finish as the 1st with one of the four different cars available (from slow ones to really fast ones). 
 
The heart of the single-player mode (besides the quick battle against the AI) are the bronze, silver and gold challenges for every track you need to complete to play free the next track. Each challenge is one of the seven (eight in multiplayer) game modes available in Mashed. From normal race-events (just be the 1st) over battles where you need to kill all your enemies before they do to the ultimate survival mode where everyone doesn't really like you. 
 
To make things much easier there are nine different power-ups and weapons scattered on the tracks which you can pick up. From simple oil slicks over mines to deadly mortars there's everything you need to kick the enemy drivers out of the race. Of course they can also choose from the equipment. As you can only survive a few hits you need to make sure they can't use them on you. And to make it even worse there are many small passages (or the track is just one small passage...) with nothing on one or both sides of the track in which you or your enemy can fall very deep.</desc>

		<name>Driver : Parallel Lines</name>
		<desc>Driver: Parallel Lines is the fourth game in the Driver series, following the story of TK. In 1978, TK (who was then an 18-year-old driver-for-hire who had just graduated from high school) was sentenced to 28 years in prison for a crime he did not commit, and is released from prison in 2006. Now, with his driving skills, he seeks revenge against the police department for having to serve time for something someone else should've gone to prison for! 
 
Unlike Driv3r, Driver: Parallel Lines mostly takes place behind the wheel, returning back to the formula that made the first game a classic. The game still has a GTA-style open-ended design, though, and you can still exit your vehicle for some on-foot action. However, there's no reason to exit your vehicle unless it's damaged and you can no longer drive it, as almost all of the game's missions involve cop car chases. If that's the case, then you can either go to the repair shop to repair your vehicle, or just steal someone else's vehicle! Until then, you can punch the cops with your fists and steal their weapons when they're dead, so that you can use them for future on-foot combat.</desc>

 Echo Night: Beyond is a 1st person adventure game. Controlling Richard, the player armed with nothing more than a flashlight after a tragic moon shuttle crash moves around picking up and interacting with objects, including security cameras and computer logs. He remains in his space suit which provides a flashlight as well as a heart monitor. As he explores his surroundings on the moon, he's bound to become fearful and a little creeped out. If Richard's heart rate ever goes above 300, he'll die and the game is over.</desc>

The story takes two roads of two different heroes who run around fields killing monsters in real time action a bit like in Zelda games. The hook in this game, or not so much of a hook, but the thing that separates it from most of other RPG is that the characters don't level up. The power of character is measured by his equipment so when you get a better sword, you kinda level up that way. The weapons and equipment are also customizable so if you like playing with your tools, this is the game for you. This was the first RPG to appear on PS2 in Europe.</desc>

		<desc>On December 24, 2005, Sergeant Dennis Riley, member of the special U.S. Marine Team Red Light receives a distress call from Fort Stewart, a top secret research facility in Antarctica. The signal requests an immediate air strike on the base. The team is sent to investigate the matter, but their plane crashes in the tundra. When Dennis arrives at the facility he finds out that something horrible has occurred, and must fight for his life as he encounters mutated creatures and is in danger of getting infected himself. 
 
Extermination is a survival horror game. The player character has limited ammunition for his firearms and in many cases it is advisable to run away from monsters. Besides the traditional health bar Dennis also has an Infection Rate, which may gradually grow when attacked by monsters. Once his Infection Rate reaches 100% he becomes very weak and would eventually mutate into a monster. Infection can be countered by applying MTS vaccines.  
 
The player character's default weapon, a special purpose rifle, can be customized with enhancements such as zoom scope, flashlight grip, radar, and parts which convert it to other weapon types such as flame thrower, shotgun, or rocket launcher. Dennis can also fight with a knife. Throughout the game batteries must be collected and used for activating various machines and saving the game.</desc>

		<desc>This fireworks-based puzzle title is notable for being the only title available from Sony on the PlayStation 2's launch date. In a manner similar to Missile Command, the goal is to select and detonate matched groups of flares. Using the analog stick to point from flare to flare, a player must link three or more similar flares and set them off in a chain of fireworks explosions. The bigger the chain, the higher your score. 
 Each level has a predetermined length and a set course, scrolling through cities, outer space, and unknown territories. With a limited amount of energy, players stay alive by detonating as many flares as possible, and by grabbing various power-ups as they appear onscreen. Collecting enough "star" power-ups releases a "Starmine" flare -- a sort of bonus round, rapid-fire succession of flares. 
 Upon successfully completing a level, you can watch a replay using various camera angles and add different lighting and weather effects. You can also store your best rounds on a memory card and show your fireworks displays off to your friends. Skilled players will be able to unlock a few extra options once they complete the regular game, including a Master Chain mode.</desc>

		<desc>Miku Hinasaki is young girl with a strange sixth sense. Her brother, Mafuyu, and his mentor, Junsei Takamine, went to investigate a mansion that once was inhabited by a powerful landowner who had absolute control over the area. Unfortunately, they never returned from their investigation. Miku enters the mansion, armed with only an antique camera given to her by her deceased mother, to try to find her brother. 
 
While inside the mansion, Miku will encounter ghosts and other spiritual apparitions. In order to overcome these spirits and survive, she must use the magical camera to capture the ghosts on film, thereby trapping them forever. Ghosts range from invisible fragments hidden in scenery, to memories of the past that appear only for a moment before vanishing, to full body apparitions that will attempt to attack and kill Miku. 
 
In order to defeat an aggressive ghost the Camera Obscura's shot must first be "charged" by keeping the ghost centered while it is visible. If Miku snaps a shot while the ghost is attacking or is vulnerable then she will drain even more energy from it, resulting in more spirit points being earned. Points can then be spent to improve her camera's attributes or give it special abilities, like slowing a ghost or pushing it away. The Camera Obscura can also reveal clues and dispel illusions, which Miku will need to utilize to solve puzzles within the mansion.</desc>

		<name>Fatal Frame II : Crimson Butterfly</name>
		<desc>Twin sisters Mio and Mayu, while visiting a vacation spot from their childhood, become lost in a dark forest. The path disappears behind them as they enter the Lost Village, a place that vanished from the living world years ago. Ghosts of the townspeople walk the streets and search for the twins, intent on completing a dark ritual long left unfinished. Mayu begins to grow distant from Mio as well, and she begins to speak as if she were another person entirely. By chance Mio finds the Camera Obscura, and with its powers she searches for a way out get her sister and herself out of the village. 
 
Fatal Frame II has mostly the same gameplay as the first game in the series, although with a few tweaks. The camera no longer has to charge up a shot, but different film types now have loading times that can leave leave Mio defenseless if she takes a picture at a bad time. Special abilities for the camera no longer require a disposable item, and are instead charged by taking good shots of attacking ghosts. The stats of the camera and special abilities are still upgraded/unlocked with spirit points, but an item must first be found and spent as well to upgrade each level of a stat. 
 
The Xbox release of Fatal Frame II includes an additional difficulty level, an additional ending, several extra unlockable cosmetic accessories, six additional unlockable pairs of costumes for Mio and Mayu, an unlockable survival mode with an additional ghost type, and an optional first person control/view style.</desc>

Here she is frightened by images of her dead fiancÃ©. The game incorporates the camera mode from the previous games, used to capture ghosts. You use the camera obscura not only as a weapon to capture ghosts but as a guide by taking pictures of the ghosts and creepy objects in the house in order to solve the mystery and get rid of the curse. You walk around with a strobe light looking for clues to the mystery. 
 
Throughout the course of the game you can play as three women and switch between a dream world and real-life. All in all, it carries over the same Japanese horror theme as the first two.</desc>

		<name>Fight Club</name>
		<desc>Fight Club is based on David Fincher's film adaption of Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name. Fed up with consumerist American culture, a fight club is founded as a new type of therapy through bare-knuckle fighting. The game focuses on the fights and uses many characters and environments from the original story. You can create a new fighter or clone one of the generated characters. There are three general fighting styles to choose from: grappling, kung fu or brawling. The moves range from basic punches to devastating moves with broken bones, ripped clothes and real-time facial deformation. After each successful fight, you earn Character Development Points (CDP's) which can be used to upgrade or heal your character. 
 
Aside from the regular arcade, survival and training mode, there is a story mode in which you need to work your way up as a rookie to become a key player in Project Mayhem in a storyline very loosely based on the original plot. Both the PS2 and Xbox version have an online multiplayer mode as well.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy X</name>
		<desc>Square's acclaimed role-playing series makes its PlayStation 2 debut with Final Fantasy X. Players assume the role of Tidus, an athletic teenager who witnessed the destruction of his home city by an evil entity named Sin. While his life was spared, Tidus' contact with Sin opened a portal through time. Some 1,000 years have passed since the encounter, and Tidus now finds himself in a strange land with unfamiliar faces. As Tidus struggles to find a way back home, he will meet a variety of characters, including Yuna, a girl faced with the daunting task of defeating Sin.   Final Fantasy X features a number of new features over previous installments. Backgrounds and characters are rendered entirely in 3D, with real-time facial expressions visible on each character. When characters are surprised, for example, they will raise their eyebrows or open their mouths in astonishment. For the first time in the series, dialogue has been recorded using professional voice actors. The U.S. version features voices in English, with optional English subtitles selectable from the menu screen.</desc>

		<desc>The game's story follows the character Yuna from Final Fantasy X as she seeks to resolve political conflicts in the fictional world of Spira before it leads to war. 
 
The story begins as Yuna, Rikku and Paine recover Yuna's stolen Garment Grid from the Leblanc Syndicate in the first of several encounters in which they vie for spheres. The game is punctuated by a narration of Yuna addressing Tidus, as though she is recounting the events of the game to him as they occur in a style reminiscent of Tidus' own narration in Final Fantasy X. Although Yuna's quest is to find clues that may lead her to Tidus, much of the storyline of the game follows the clash of the factions that have established themselves in the time since the coming of the Eternal Calm in Final Fantasy X, and the uncovering of hidden legacies from Spira's ancient history. A significant portion of the game's events are unnecessary for the completion of the main storyline, but much of the depth of the story?including characterization and background details?are featured in the optional content, which generally follows how each part of Spira is healing in the time since the passing of Sin.</desc>

After the end of a fight one evening, Kyle and Cody decide to meet at the local bar to celebrate with some beers and a round of pool; however, Cody has some unspoken business that delays his arrival for an hour. After Kyle arrives at the bar, he plays a game with his girlfriend and bar owner Vanessa Simms, while waiting for Cody. Kyle later finds out that Cody is using a powerful strength-enhancing drug called "glow", which helps the arthritis in his knees. Kyle later discovers that glow is being made by a psychotic priest named Father Bella, who hopes to use the drug to bring about the apocalypse. When Kyle finds Bella on the roof of his church, Cody is with him, mutated by a concentrated dose of glow. It is later revealed that Bella is actually the younger brother of Belger, the antagonist of the original game, just before he and Kyle begin to fight.</desc>

		<desc>Blending high-speed races and dynamic crashes along with a cinematic storyline, FlatOut comes to the PS2 with a number of features designed to set it apart from previous racing titles. Players can leave their car before entering a race to check out the competition at the pit areas, glean some information at the local bar, perform tune-ups, and embark on brief missions to further the story. The heart of the game is the racing competition, where players hit the pedal to the metal on a variety of outdoor venues. The environment is also interactive, to the point where cars can smash through wooden barriers, send piles of stacked tires bouncing along the road, and knock orange cones flying into the distance. A number of jumps are also available, to catch some air. 
 Real-time damage modeling is another highlight in FlatOut, with details such as engines, transmissions, and the driver viewable after smashing, crashing, and bashing into rival vehicles. Each part is designed to dent, crumple, crack, or fly off, and parts hurtling through the air can damage other vehicles as well.</desc>

The story begins when the characters have to dock to the island to survive the raging storm. 29 years earlier, all the island's inhabitants disappeared in a blackout and you will need to investigate this mystery. 
 
The sequel adds new features in the game, which most notably you will notice, apart from the original Shibito zombies, as the new Yami Bito demons. The sequel also has a new alert system which functions through the controller's vibration function and alerts you of any nearby danger. 
 
Stealth plays an important role, as well as light and darkness, as the creatures are sensitive to it in different ways. Just like in the previous game, you can sight-jack enemies and animals, to view the environment through their eyes. There are over 30 weapons to collect and there are three difficulty options.</desc>

Following a plot of justice and vengeance, you take the role of the gifted Paul Atreides to lead the mystic Fremen tribes against the House of Harkonnen, which massacred his family and stole his birthright in its greedy quest for power. 
 As Paul Atreides, you must complete a series of missions to prove your worth to the Fremen, including evasion or killing of Harkonnen soldiers. Gameplay elements include stealth (knifing guards from the side or from behind) and overt methods using a variety of projectile weapons. Healing your character of damage requires water -- on the desert planet, water is life. As water is limited in natural form, surprising and killing an enemy soldier with a knife allows you to take a portion of his body's water for healing purposes.</desc>

		<desc>Freekstyle is a EA Sports' take on motocross racing. This game is all about going fast and doing cool tricks. There are essentially two games here: first there is a straightforward racing game, where you race three laps around a circuit and attempt to finish first. The second part of the game is a freestyle competition, where you perform tricks to score points, and attempt to rack up the biggest total. 
 
The racing game, or "Freekstyle" mode, combines racing and tricks. You will race around a circuit track, and attempt to perform tricks at the big jumps you encounter along the way. Performing tricks fills your boost meter, which then gives you a speed boost you can use at your discretion. If you perform enough tricks, eventually you can break into "freakout" mode, where you can travel at ludicrous speed. 
 
Freekstyle features the voices and likeness of several real-life motocross stars.</desc>

Previously released in Europe, Garfield: Lasagna World Tour gives North American gamers the opportunity to take the normally sedentary feline through Mexico, Italy, and Egypt on a PAWS TV sponsored treasure hunt for his favorite dish. Players can also use Odie in tricky situations, and Garfield can climb on the back of his canine companion for high-speed chase sequences.

		<name>Gauntlet : Seven Sorrows</name>
		<desc>Gauntlet is back for yet another iteration. The Emperor has crucified his four loyal heroes to a magic tree, driven by a maniac thirst for their immortality. Hundreds of years later, as only a ghost, he came to regret all the wrong deeds he has done and frees them, asking them to defeat his six former advisors in an attempt to undo what he has done. 
 
This version of Gauntlet goes back to the roots: The warrior, valkyrie, elf, and wizard fight their way through hordes of enemies to make their way to the six bosses. The game is mostly a hack'n'slash affair, puzzles are limited to finding keys and pressing buttons that open doors and portals. Every character has a unique set of moves and attacks: The warrior has rather powerful attacks, the valkyrie has quick moves, the elf can shoot powerful arrows, and the wizard has several magical range attacks. 
 
Defeating enemies gives you experience points that may be used to increase your three stats; some chests in the levels contain better armor or weapons. Also, new moves can be purchased with gold. 
 
The game can be played both in single-player as well as cooperative multi-player, where up to four players fight together. 
 
The newest feature of this game (other than the much better graphics) is the online gaming feature. Played online, the game is identical to a regular multiplayer game, with each player on a different box.</desc>

		<name>Genji : Dawn of the Samurai</name>
		<desc>Based loosely on the influential, 11th century romantic novel The Tale of Genji, Genji: Dawn of the Samurai is a combat-focused adventure set in a feudal Japan rife with magic and mystery. Players alternate between control of two lead characters: the young, lithe Yoshitsune, who wields twin samurai blades, and the grizzled, burly Benkei, who fights with an enormous club. Success in battle allows players to gradually upgrade their characters' skills. The game's story leads them on a journey of discovery and honor, through a foreign land where they are often met with distrust and aggression. 
 Acting as the historic hero Genkuro Yoshitsune or his trusted companion Benkei, the warrior monk, you set out on a mission to release the oppressed from the evil forces of the warlord Kiyomori and restore the Genji dynasty to power.</desc>

		<desc>Mark Hammond is an ex-gangster who wants to forget his past and live honestly with his wife and little son. Everything goes horribly wrong when London's most vicious criminal, the organized crime boss Charlie Jolson, decides that he needs Mark's services and obtains them in a twisted and cruel way: Mark's wife is murdered, he is framed for this murder, and his child gets kidnapped.  
 
Jolson makes it clear: unless Mark does what he orders him to do, the boy dies. Using the helpless man in his plan to bring down other criminal organizations of the city, Jolson sends Mark on suicidal missions during which Mark has three terrible choices: walk away and lose his son, get killed in a battle against overwhelming odds, or single-handedly help Jolson to get rid of his adversaries. 
 
Once the player completes Mark Hammond's story, a new scenario opens, in which the player controls Frank Carter, a vigilante cop who won't stop until he brings Charlie Jolson to justice. Frank's scenario is parallel to Mark's, shedding more light on events that remain somewhat unexplained during Mark's scenario.</desc>

Set in a run-down, supernaturally afflicted Detroit, Ghost Hunter begins in earnest soon after Lazarus and his partner unwittingly disturb an otherworldly experiment and unleash forces of the beyond. 
 One of these freed entities bonds with the hero, gifting him with a number of special powers and abilities. Unfortunately, Lazarus' partner Anna Steele does not fair so well. She is, quite literally, spirited away. Players lead the game's hero on a brooding, spooky quest to save her, and the rest of the world as well, from the dangerous ghosts they accidentally set free. 
 STORY: 
 Few people have the ability to see ghosts, and few spirits are able to communicate with the outside world, but the earth is nonetheless full of supernatural forces the remnants of every creature killed before its time. Some degenerate into monstrous creatures, others exist for centuries increasing in power and retaining a human mind. A number of these creatures have formed 'The Parliament of Spooks' and their sole aim is to steal back life from the living.</desc>

Players control one of four available ships over the constantly scrolling landscapes and need to earn a high score (and survive!) by shooting the various enemies that appear and dodging numerous bullets and obstacles. The game is a "bullet hell" style shooter and there are a significant number of bullets to dodge, sometimes hundreds at a time covering the entire screen. Each of the available ships has three types of attacks. The first is the basic attack. Next is the reflect force; this acts as a temporary shield and any bullets that are encountered are gathered and then fired back at the enemy. The final attack is a bomb and is the most powerful attack affecting everything on the screen. The four ships each have different attack abilities and flight characteristics. As is typical in arcade style shooters, weapon upgrades can be acquired to increase your firepower.</desc>

		<desc>God of War is an action-oriented adventure game with a strong focus on fast-paced combat. Players take control of Kratos, a mystically powerful hero in the ancient Greece of classic mythology. Kratos can perform super-human leaps, agile dodges, and magically enhanced combo attacks, which all flow together in a stream of intense engagement. The fast-paced, over-the-top fighting, combined with the tense environments and computer-directed camera angles, give gameplay the feel of combat-adventures such as Devil May Cry or Otogi.   Unlike those earlier blends of survival-horror presentation and combat-minded control schemes, however, God of War is set in a world more immediately familiar to all fans of western fantasy. The ultimate goal of Kratos is a conclusive confrontation with Ares -- the god of war himself -- but the hero must face a deadly succession of monsters and villains from Greek mythology as he pursues this end. The Hydra, Medusa, the Cyclops, the Minotaur, and other legendary creatures will all have their chances to destroy Kratos before he meets his final destiny.</desc>

Players now accumulate points by winning races in the normal first-person driving mode, called A-Spec mode. Each race event can yield up to a maximum of 200 A-Spec points. Generally, a win using a car with less of an advantage over the AI opponents is worth more points. Points can only be won once, so to win further points from a previously-won event, it must be re-won using a car with less of an advantage over the AI. There are also the 34 Missions which can yield 250 points each. Despite this, A-Spec points are experience points, not money.</desc>

The leader of the organization for whom he used to work, Sonny Forelli, fears that Tommy's presence in Liberty City will heighten tensions and bring unwanted attention upon his organization's criminal activities. To prevent this, Sonny ostensibly "promotes" Tommy and sends him to Vice City to act as their buyer for a series of cocaine deals.[7] During Tommy's first meeting with the drug dealers, an ambush by an unknown party results in the death of Tommy's bodyguards, Harry and Lee, and the cocaine dealer. There is another survivor, the pilot of the dealer's helicopter, who flies off and escapes. Tommy narrowly escapes with his life, but he loses both the Forelli's money and the cocaine.</desc>

		<desc>Vice City Stories is a prequel to Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2 years earlier) and it is the sequel to Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories. Set in 1984, players take on the role of Vic Vance, an army soldier who loves his country, family, and himself. One bad decision turns everything around and he is kicked onto the streets of a tough city. He has to build an empire to survive, or be left to die. Together with his brother Lance, a drug addict, the siblings try to take over Vice City. 
 
Just like other GTA titles, gameplay consists of third-person shooting and driving sequences in an open environment. You will meet new enemies and gangs, and old foes. The missions require you to kill with a selection of weapons, steal vehicles such as a car, a boat, or a plane, rob to make it big, or just to have fun.</desc>

Running around wildly, they created monsters who disturbed the peace in the world and provoked two mighty nations to start an all-destroying war. After years of battles and pain, the two nations finally decided to sign a peace agreement. Now they wish concentrate together on hunting down and eliminating the insane Spirits. You control a young boy named Evan, who wants to become a Ranger (a fighter who possesses unique abilities), like his father. But before he can be initiated as a Ranger, he has to fulfill an important mission and help to save his world from the Spirits. 
 
Grandia Xtreme is the first Grandia game to be originally released for Playstation 2. Its combat system is virtually the same as in the previous two games, a mixture of strategic planning and combo attacks. Your party members can run around, avoid enemy attacks, and their attack power depends on their distance from the enemies. Grandia Xtreme is heavily based on combat, with more dungeons, more fighting, and less story than the two previous installments of the series.</desc>

Much like its predecessor, Gungrave: Overdose offers up several action-packed levels that simply don't allow the player to let up on the fire button. This sequel ups the ante with even larger hordes of enemies to blast through along with a slew of destructible environments to wreak havoc in. Along the way, Grave will team up with newcomers Juji and Billy. Juji fights using a unique combination of close-range guns and swordplay, while Billy defeats his enemies with the sheer power of his electric guitar. 
 
Gungrave: Overdose features character designs by Yasuhiro Nightow (creator of the anime/manga Trigun) and Kosuke Fujishima (known for his work on Sakura Wars, Ah My Goddess, and the Tales series), and soundtrack composition by Tsuneo Imahori (composer for Trigun, Hajime no Ippo and the Gungrave anime series).

The third expansion for the original game, it features two-player cooperative gameplay (in split-screen) with the two female scientists Gina Cross and Colette Green as the protagonists. It is meant to be played with two players at the same time as it is more puzzle-oriented than the original game and the first two expansions. Singleplayer is also possible, but then switching between the two characters is necessary to advance. When not active, the other character is AI controlled for basic actions.</desc>

		<name>Harvest Moon : Save the Homeland</name>
		<desc>Harvest Moon: Save the Homeland marks a significant shift in focus for the series, becoming more of a "life simulation" than the "farm simulation" it once was. Unlike previous incarnations where the main objective was to resurrect a dying farm and ultimately turn a profit, this PS2 title presents players with a slightly more desperate predicament: The land upon which the village is built has been earmarked for the development of a new resort complex. Construction begins in exactly one year and in that time you'll have to find a way to save the village. Incidentally, there are nine different ways that this can be achieved, providing nine different game endings. 
 Harvest Moon: Save the Homeland is also the first title in the series to make use of 3D environments, and has included a user-definable camera that can be manipulated as needed with the aid of the right analog stick. The game also makes use of "cel-shading" -- a technique that has become synonymous with cartoon-style games.</desc>

		<desc>Haven: Call of the King is an epic adventure starring a young man on a quest to free his enslaved world from a tyrant named Lord Vetch. The one relic with the power to rescue his people is the Golden Voice, a bell magically forged to help those in dire need. As the warrior Haven, players will venture across futuristic lands while avoiding all manner of dangers. In addition to traveling on foot, Haven will race across waters in a boat, speed across land in a vehicle, and even explore the depths of space.

The action is driven by a cinematic storyline that sheds new light on the world Haven is trying so desperately to save. 
 
 
 The King Athellion has left his homeworld to fight in an intergalactic crusade. He left behind a huge bell - The Golden Voice - for his people to call him should they ever be in danger. During his absence however, the evil Lord Vetch invades the planet and enslaves Athellion's people by infecting them with a deadly virus. A virus, that requires a constant treatment with an antidote called catana. As the only one controlling the catana-support, Lord Vetch was easily able to force everyone to work for him. In order to prevent Athelion's return he has hidden The Golden Voice and soon it was forgotten along with the king's promise. Forgotten until Haven, one of the slaves, starts having dreams about a hill and a bell; dreams whose meaning he does not understand. When the news of the Haven's dreams reach Lord Vetch, he orders to murder him.

		<desc>Enter a dark future where bounty hunters rule the streets and human organs are the preferred currency. Take the role of Jack Wade, a man whose memory has been stolen. Follow a story of violence and mystery in a quest to bring heartless killers to justice. The action takes place from both first- and third-person perspectives, in 3D locations ranging from seedy biker bars to futuristic laboratories. Headhunter is one of two Dreamcast games ported to the PS2 by Acclaim in 2002. Along with Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future, this title has been optimized in its move to the Sony console. 
 Welcome to the future. In the early 21st century, gang warfare and crime have lead to the creation of privatised law enforcement. The Anti-Crime Network (ACN) employs bounty hunters known as ?Headhunters? to track down the most wanted criminals, using combat skills and high-tech weaponry.</desc>

		<name>Headhunter : Redemption</name>
		<desc>As bounty hunters in a disturbing future, players must sneak by, strong-arm, and shoot down those who would flee from justice. This action-adventure is built upon the story and gameplay of the original Headhunter (also developed by Amuze), released in 2001 for European Dreamcasts and ported to North American PS2s the following year. Unlike the original, however, Headhunter: Redemption offers two main characters and two different, urban game worlds for them to patrol and protect. 
 
 Played primarily from a third-person perspective, Redemption has players taking the role of either headhunter veteran Jack Wade or his new associate, a punky street kid called Leeza X. Acting as a force for order, the two will travel to the city's wealthy, well-lit "Above," as well as its dark and downtrodden "Below," to enforce a justice once common to both of these two, disparate places.</desc>

		<name>Heroes of Might and Magic : Quest for the DragonBone Staff</name>
		<desc>Heroes of Might and Magic: Quest for the DragonBone Staff is really the old classic King's Bounty from New World Computing for the PC with revamped graphics. Very little else has changed, in fact even the text was the exact same with the original. 
 
 For those who are not familiar with the history of the series, King's Bounty was a spin-off of the Might &amp; Magic RPG series which was then still in its early chapters and was inspired by board games. The gameplay resembles a simplified Heroes of Might &amp; Magic game with only one Hero and no city improvements. Combat is turn-based using a set grid and stacked units. 
 
 The goal of the game is to discover an ancient artifact by collecting pieces of a map and identifying its location before time runs out. Of course the player must have amassed a strong army by then because he will have to face the evil Dragon overlord before the end.</desc>

Sticking to the series' successful mix of approachable interface and realistic action, the game offers players numerous perspectives of each lie and shots are made through button taps, timed to a fluctuating bar that determines power and accuracy.   Hot Shots Golf Fore! offers a dozen courses (some of which were featured in Hot Shots Golf 3), and an even greater selection of characters to play through them. As in earlier games, certain characters are available from the start and players will need to unlock the others, but all can be customized with different clothing and equipment. A number of caricatured caddies are also available, to offer support and advice (sometimes, whether it's wanted or not).   A favorite feature from the PlayStation's original Hot Shots Golf returns in this version: the ability to play 18 holes of carom-friendly miniature golf. Hot Shots Golf Fore! is also the first in the series to offer online play. PlayStation 2 gamers with the PS2 Network Adaptor can log in to join other virtual golfers from all over the country. The online mode supports text chat, allowing two players to talk back and forth in real-time via keyboard.</desc>

		<name>Indigo Prophecy</name>
		<desc>Indigo Prophecy (Fahrenheit in Europe) is a psychological thriller in which the player is able to control different characters on both sides of a murder - the killer and those who are trying to find him. The game's core gameplay style is adventure. The three protagonists explore various locations, talk to other characters, and interact with the environment in order to advance. However, the game is heavy on various action-oriented sequences, from tasks that must be completed within a limited amount of time to quick time events, which require the player to press the correct button during a scene. 
 
The game emphasizes realism in the player's interaction with the environment. For example, picking up a rag and cleaning the floor requires the player to move the mouse or the analog stick back and forth, imitating the actual movements of the object. Dialogue with character often imposes time limits on the player; failure to choose the optimal response in time will prompt the game to choose another, not always the optimal one. The player's choice will sometimes influence the subsequent events and the outcome of the entire story, eventually leading it to one of the three possible endings.</desc>

		<name>Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy</name>
		<desc>The creators of the beloved Crash Bandicoot series bring out a new duo of heroes for 3D platforming on the PS2 with this release of Naughty Dog's Jak and Daxter. While Jak is a handsome young hero with big blue eyes and bushy blond hair, his companion Daxter has been transformed into a small weasel-like creature by a strange dark curse. The two heroes set out to seek the forgotten secrets of the Precursors, an ancient race that inhabited the land many ages ago. Only by seeking the wisdom of the ancients can they hope to change Daxter back to his natural form. 
 
 The game is designed to provide a large 3D world populated with towns, ruins, and diverse wilderness areas and it does not follow any strict level progression. The storyline is open-ended enough to allow Jak and Daxter to find their own way through the adventure, searching the land, accepting quests, and taking on powerful boss characters in the order the player chooses. By helping local inhabitants Jak and Daxter can earn power cells, which help to open up new areas. The heroes also find new weapons and gain new spell as they journey through the land.</desc>

		<name>Jak II</name>
		<desc>The sequel to 2001's best-selling Jak and Daxter once again follows the exploits of the elfin hero Jak and his churlish sidekick, a weasel-like creature named Daxter. Using the same 60 frames per second graphic engine as its predecessor, albeit with a number of refinements for more dramatic visual effects, Jak II takes place in a darker, more futuristic world than the original game. The titular hero, now older and wiser, has a number of new moves and abilities this time around, all of which are available right from the start. As players make their way through this mystical world, acquiring power-ups and interacting with an assortment of characters, they will unravel over an hour of cinematic cut-scenes to further the story. 
 
 
 Jak's new skills have him zipping around the world atop a hoverboard, using multiple weapons such as a laser rifle to neutralize foes, and performing a number of acrobatics to escape from harm's way.</desc>

Summoned to Kras City to hear the reading of Krew's will, the duo find that they have been thrust into a deadly plot where everyone present at the reading has been unknowingly poisoned. In order for the antidote to be administered in time, Jak and Daxter must race in the Kras City Grand Championship. 
 Featuring over a dozen customizable vehicles designed with unique handling characteristics, players will race their "whip" through 20 tracks in eight different terrain arenas. With an assortment of power-ups available, including projectile weapons, mines, ranged weapons, turbo boosts, shields, and smart bombs, players should have the means necessary to ensure they're the first (and last) to cross the finish line.</desc>

Just Cause has Rodriguez attempting to overthrow a fictitious South American island's regime by instigating a revolution. Players will accomplish this by working with citizens, political factions, rebels, and even drug cartels in a series of explosive operations. 
 In the tradition of games like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Just Cause features a free form world with an estimated 250,000 acres of territory to traverse by plane, car, boat, or in some cases, parachute. Since the island of San Esperito is filled with cities, towns, resorts, jungles, and mountains, players can acquire more than 100 vehicles throughout their tumultuous stay. The main storyline includes over 20 missions with objectives that can be accomplished by any number of means. Hundreds of side and bonus missions are also available for fun or profit, with stunt challenges like parasailing, vehicle leaping, or skydiving part of the itinerary for tropical thrill-seekers.</desc>

		<name>Katamari Damacy</name>
		<desc>The King of All Cosmos accidentally destroyed the stars andâ€”having recoveredâ€”wants the prince to rebuild them. Unfortunately the prince stands a little less than half a foot tall, so recreating the stars will require some effort. Enter the Katamari, a sphere the prince can push around our world to â€œroll upâ€  items increasing the Katamariâ€™s size until itâ€™s suitable for the King.    Taking place in stylized versions of Japanese houses, cities, and environs, the prince pushes the Katamari around collecting items which adhere to it. At first, the prince can only pick up smaller items, but as the Katamari grows, the more it can collect. Push pins and paper clips cling to the Katamari increasing its size so it can roll over obstacles and pick up bigger items. Over many levels, the Katamari can eventually pick up people, cars, and other bigger items.    Players steer the Katamari from a third-person perspective using the analog sticks on the PS2. A tutorial stage takes the player through the controls and sets up the story as well as introducing a side story about a Japanese girl who can feel the cosmos. Wanting to challenge the prince, the King sets requirements on the Katamariâ€™s size and sets time limits on the level. Bonus missions restore constellations and have their own restrictions.     The world of Katamari Damacy is brought to life with off-beat animation and a catchy soundtrack. Players can find presents hidden in the levels that contain accessories for the prince. Two players can also battle head-to-head in a Katamari competition.</desc>

 While the predecessors focused on the same style of swordplay, the victor of the battles was unclear until the very end.

 Kessen is the story of two warring clans waging war against each other for control of the entire land, during 15th and 16th century Japan. Tokugawa Ieyasu is a very strong and powerful leader and is tired of seeing the country ruled by his archenemy, Toyotomi Hideyoshi.</desc>

		<name>Kessen II</name>
		<desc>It is a time of war. Many leaders from different factions fight to control their land. One such leader, Liu Bei, has only one wish: peace. But war stands in his way, after his land Shu is attacked by the kingdom of Wei, led by the warlord Cao Cao, who abducts Liu Bei's beloved Diao Chan, the keeper of the Imperial Seal. Liu Bei has to flee, but swears to return, exact revenge on Cao Cao, and liberate the kingdom of Shu. 
 
Kessen II is a real-time strategy game, and a follow-up to Kessen. Unlike the first game, it is set in the Chinese Three Kingdoms period. The account of historical events is heavily fictionalized in the game, liberally adding new sub-plots (such as the entire romance angle of the story) and supernatural elements. The player can choose to command the armies of either Liu Bei or Cao Cao in their respective scenarios. 
 
The gameplay is similar to that of the previous game, the most notable change being the shift to supernatural warfare, including the addition of magical attacks such as tornadoes, lightning strikes, earthquakes, meteor showers, etc.  The player can now control 500 units at one time, as opposed to 100 in the previous game. New unit types (elite horsemen, elephant cavalry, etc.) have been added.</desc>

The two main aspects of this game are planning and engaging in battle. Select officers and strategically place them on the field of battle, assign commands and issue orders. When on the battlefield, each of the officers, including Nobunaga, will have his/her army at their disposal which can be controlled at any point.

The King of Fighters XI features a roster of 33 "team" characters, 7 PS2 exclusive characters, 5 mid-boss characters and 2 boss characters. In total, this allows a player to choose between +40 characters. Many of the characters are returning fighters from the other games in the KOF series, though notable new faces exist in the effective forms of Oswald, Duck King, Bonne Jenet, Elisabeth Blanctorche and Gai Tendo.</desc>

 The whole game revolves around the strange events at a medieval Japanese manor and the nearby shrine. Yin Phase revolves around a sheltered girl named Utsuki. Her father is a civilian exorcist who has been summoned to investigate the manor. When he does not return, she and her sister travel to the manor in search of him. At the manor, eerie hymns put her sister into a trance, and she vanishes into the gloom. Utsuki must now find both her father and her sister.</desc>

Moebius the Timestreamer tells Raziel that Kain is at the Pillars of Nosgoth, and Raziel goes and confronts him. Kain reveals he has plans to transform history to avert the consequences of his decision, when his past self refused to sacrifice himself to restore Nosgoth and doomed the land to eternal decay. Kain vanishes, and Raziel continues northward and finds the vampire Vorador, who hints at a profound secret that the deceased vampire Janos Audron once knew. Deciding to speak with Janos, Raziel returns to the Sarafan stronghold where he again meets Kain, who tells Raziel the Soul Reaver is the only way history can be changed, as he did so when battling William the Just with a future incarnation of the Reaver in Blood Omen. Kain hands Raziel the material Soul Reaver, and the spectral Soul Reaver Raziel has coils around it. Raziel is faced with a dilemma: kill Kain and submit to fate, or establish his free will by refusing. Raziel avoids dealing the death blow, changing time again before Kain vanishes. Raziel finds Moebius in his timestreaming chamber and forces him to send him to the past before the vampire purge of the Sarafan Order, but Moebius tricks him.</desc>

		<desc>Manhunt is a third-person stealth horror game. The game consists of twenty levels, and four bonus levels that can be unlocked; the levels are referred to as "scenes". Players survive the Scenes by dispatching enemy gang members known as "Hunters", occasionally with firearms but primarily by stealthily executing them in gruesome, over-the-top ways. 
 
The player is rated at the end of each level, primarily dependent on the gruesomeness of the killings and the speed of completion, from one (unimpressive) to five (extremely competent) stars. Executions are preferred in order to gain a higher score, thus encouraging players to play as viscerally as possible. The game's locales are full of "dark spots" and shadows where the player can hide while being chased by the Hunters; hiding in these dark areas makes the player invisible to opponents.</desc>

In the oppressed city of New Radius, you need to establish your name as an artist by laying down tags, burners and full pieces, but rival crews and law enforcement (Civil Conduct Keepers) are always on your tail. You will also uncover a conspiracy that plagues the city. 
 The game is story-driven with linear level progression. Most missions have platform elements and require you to lay art, varying from tags and stickers to complex pieces with full color, lettering and characters, on often difficult to reach surfaces. As it is not a friendly environment, Trane can deliver a host of punch and kick combos, use grabs, humiliate other artists, and interact with the surroundings. Your art arsenal includes markers, brushes, cans and rollers. All available pieces are kept in your black book, and new styles are unlocked while playing.</desc>

		<desc>Finnish developer Remedy Entertainment's embittered vigilante cop has put his troubled past behind him and is ready to begin a new chapter in his life with Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne. The stylized third-person shooter, which initially turned heads with its combination of gritty environments, film noir style, and use of bullet-time effects for dramatic shootouts, returns with an enhanced graphic engine and completely new storyline. The Fall of Max Payne chronicles the title character's romance with a sultry siren named Mona Sax. Things are never easy for Payne, however, as Sax just so happens to be a murder suspect who leads him down a dark path from which he may be unable to walk away.</desc>

		<desc>The game is based in the Ghosts'n Goblins universe and features original character designs by Japanese illustrator Susumu Matsushita. 
 
The character is controlled by the player and can move freely within areas by running, jumping, crouching, and performing other various motions. Gameplay revolves around defeating large numbers of enemies, which can be accomplished by attacking with a sword and shield and combos and special moves. Maximo fights wearing armor, if he is hit, he will lose corresponding pieces of armor and eventually be reduced to wearing his boxer shorts, with another hit resulting in him losing a life. If Maximo loses all his lives, he can continue by giving Death Coins to the Grim Reaper. However, every time he loses all his lives, the required cost for a continue increases.</desc>

		<desc>The sequel to Maximo: From Ghosts to Glory, which was loosely based on the classic Ghosts 'n Goblins series, Maximo vs Army of Zin puts players in the role of Maximo, a master swordsman with a penchant for battling undead creatures. The action picks up where Ghosts to Glory left off, as the title hero must abandon his kingdom in order to search for his missing girlfriend. The developers at Capcom promise a more engrossing story this time around and have removed the hub screen, meaning each level flows into the next. There are 26 levels in all spread across six different environments. 
 As in earlier games in the series, Maximo wears boxer shorts beneath his armor. However, the underwear in this game actually serves a functional purpose beyond comic relief.</desc>

		<name>Mega Man X7</name>
		<desc>The plot of Mega Man X7 takes place in the 22nd century during an age when humans coexist with humanoid robots called "Reploids". As some Reploids participate in violent and destructive crime, a police organization called the "Maverick Hunters" was established to stamp out this activity. As the Reploid conflicts proceed after the Nightmare phenomena event of Mega Man X6, the world is slowly recovering. But as always, Maverick crime is rising in newly constructed cities. As this new crime wave hits, X finds himself trying to answer moral questions that have plagued him since he joined the Maverick Hunters: "Are we doing the right thing to solve this matter?", leading him to the decision of "I've had enough of this violence." Unable to assuage his conscience, he drops from the battle frontlines and assumes a more strategic support role at headquarters. With X's retirement, a massive power vacuum ensues and many independent groups develop, trying to fill the void left by the hunter. Prominent among these groups is the "Red Alert Syndicate", growing large enough to become a dominant force. The Red Alert is a new group of Reploids, similar to the Repliforce, but consisting of vigilantes. They claim to hunt Mavericks, but apparently do more than that. One of their members, Axl, decides he's had enough of their "murdering" and tries to leave the group. Red, the group's leader, is angered by Axl deserting, and goes on a rampage to get Axl back.</desc>

		<desc>Like its immediate predecessor, Megaman X8 presents its 2D-style platform-shooter action in a 3D game world. Mega Man X is joined in this adventure by two close associates, Zero and Axle, and each character has different strengths and abilities. Players can switch between two characters in the heat of battle, to solve a platform puzzle or fend of a particular enemy type, and the two characters not controlled by the player will try to help out in combat if the leading character becomes overwhelmed. 
 Characters not controlled by the player recover more quickly when the hero onscreen is performing well. As in most games in the long-running Mega Man series, defeating a boss character earns the ability to use its special weapon. Other defeated enemies may leave behind metal bits, which can be collected and used to create custom power-ups. In addition to the side-scrolling platform levels, some boss fights and other events are played from alternate perspectives.</desc>

In fact, this release combines elements of two separate arcade releases, Ver. A and Ver. B of Act Cadenza.

		<desc>Hideo Kojima's critically acclaimed "tactical espionage action" series returns to PlayStation 2 in the anticipated follow-up to 2001's Sons of Liberty. Instead of slinking around futuristic installations, knocking on metal to distract guards, or crawling underneath a cardboard box, players are given a whole new Snake to wrangle. Drawing its inspiration from films like First Blood and Rambo: First Blood Part II, Snake Eater drops players in the middle of a thick jungle teeming with wildlife and, of course, terrorists.   Heavily armed enemies dressed in camouflage gear will patrol the dense forests, waterfalls, and surrounding areas, so players will be able to climb trees, fire pistols while hanging down from branches, and crawl through hollowed out logs to stalk their prey. Along the way, Snake will have to find sustenance by catching fish or other wildlife, while being mindful of natural hazards such hornets nests, cliffs, and rapids. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater was first revealed in a 12-minute preview displayed at 2003's E3 in Los Angeles, California.</desc>

In some stages, the player can choose freely to play as Crockett or Tubbs, switching between them by the click of a button. They have different abilities (Tubbs, for instance, is tougher and can kick in doors, Crockett is more agile), and different weapons (Crockett has a pistol as primary weapon, Tubbs has a double barreled shotgun). The characters can also carry a secondary weapon, from among 14 types (9mm pistols, .45 pistols, silenced 9mm, Uzi-like sub-machineguns, etc.). Each character can use only certain types of weapon, Tubbs carrying usually the heavier ones. The primary weapons have unlimited ammo, the secondary ones don't.</desc>

 Ethan Hunt has a variety of gadgets under his care, from chaff grenades to neutralize surveillance equipment to various cameras, sensors, and recording devices to elude alarms and enemies. If players find the guards to be unavoidable, Hunt can quickly dispose of them with a flurry of punches and kicks or a selection of weapons.

		<desc>Though advertised as a sequel to the PSOne game of a similar name (which was actually a localized Gunbird), Mobile Light Force 2 is in actuality the American repackaging of Alfa System's Japanese shooter Shikigami no Shiro. Changing its original inspiration's storyline completely, the game sends the US-only MLF team to Tokyo in an effort to combat hordes of invading demons. Along the way, one or two players can team up for simultaneous blasting with six different characters through four unique stages of traditional top-down shooting. The Japanese version of the game, however, utilizes completely different plot devices, has transitional cutscenes between each level, and has the option to increase the size of your viewable area.</desc>

		<desc>Monster Hunter is a third-person action RPG, similar in style to EA's The Lord of the Rings games or Sony's Champions of Norrath. Monster Hunter features both online and offline components, allowing players to adventure on their own or form a party, with up to three friends, for a cooperative adventure using the PS2 Network Adaptor. 
 
 
 As in most role-playing games, players begin by creating a character and customizing their hero's appearance, voice and other attributes. Monster Hunter also has players creating and customizing their characters' equipment. While basic weapons and armor may be purchased from NPCs, the most powerful items in the game are made by the players' characters themselves, from the hides, teeth, scales, claws, and other parts of conquered monsters.</desc>

		<desc>Monster raising and creature contests move into the 128-bit generation as the popular Tecmo series sets up shop on the PlayStation 2 in this release of Monster Rancher 3. Though many characters and places are recognizable from earlier releases in the series, monsters in this game are represented in a cel-shaded cartoon style, similar to that of the Dreamcast's Jet Grind Radio or the contemporary PS2 release Yanya Caballista featuring Gawoo. 
  
 
As the game receives improved graphics and some additional features with its move to the more powerful console, many of the rules of play and monster-raising conventions established in earlier games remain in this version. Monsters develop according to the training and treatment they receive and players are encouraged to explore the game world to find new training opportunities. Players can generate monsters using other forms of media, as the game creates creatures according to data on music CDs and movie DVDs. While some aspects of creation are random, certain albums and movies may generate creatures specifically related to the artistic content on the disk.</desc>

This game improves upon previous installments by allowing more than one monster to be raised at once, interaction with the main character and the monsters, improved explorations, a customizable ranch, tag-team battles, improved 2P mode, a re-vamped battle system, and more detailed monsters. This game also features the longest most involved storyline of any Monster Rancher game to date. 
 
Your goal is to raise monsters to win in-game tournaments, explore for items, and improve your ranch. You can also test your raising skills by battling your monsters against a friend in 2P mode. 
 
The game still uses the innovative system of having a player insert music CDs, game discs, or DVDs into the PS2 to be read and used in making monsters. If you have a good sized collection of music, games, or movies, you can have access to a large variety of monsters very fast.</desc>

		<path>./Okage - Shadow King (USA).gz</path>
		<name>Okage : Shadow King</name>
		<desc>Okage: Shadow King is an RPG with a slight twist: it's humorous. 
 
The game's premise is that a boy (nameable by the player with the default name of Ari) makes a deal with an evil spirit to cure his sister of a curse that's caused her to speak entirely in pig Latin. The spirit, Evil King Stanley Hihat Trinidad XIV (or Stan for short), assumes the role of your shadow and orders you to track down the lost remnants of his power, which have been siphoned away by impostor Evil Kings over the last few thousand years while he was trapped in a bottle. And, while you're at it, Stan would also like you to help him take over the world. 
 
The game plays similarly to most JRPGs. Ari will visit towns and fight (turn based) battles against monsters - which in this game happen to be things like wild cows and man eating onions. Party members level up and gain new skills as they gain experience. Ari can respond to the story and other characters with a number of different dialogue options, such as a nice response, a rude response, or a silly response, and how he acts will affect how different party members feel about him.</desc>

Shiranui and Nagi are unable to defeat Orochi, but manage to seal the demon away.   In the game's present, Susano, a descendant of Nagi and self-proclaimed greatest warrior, breaks Orochi's seal due to the fact that he does not believe in the legend and wants to prove it false; Orochi escapes and curses the lands, sapping the life from every living being. Sakuya, the wood sprite and guardian of Kamiki Village, calls forth Amaterasu, the sun goddess, known to the villagers as the reincarnation of the white wolf Shiranui, and pleads for her to remove the curse that covers the land. Accompanied by the artist Issun (an inch-high creature known as a Poncle), Amaterasu is able to restore the land to its former beauty.</desc>

		<name>Onimusha : Warlords</name>
		<desc>Onimusha: Warlords is set in 16th century Japan during the period of the civil war dominated by Nobunaga Oda. You play Samanosuke Akechi, who dies during an attempt to stop the kidnapping of young princess Yuki, the sister to Yoshitatsu Saito. However, Akechi is given another chance at life, and is handed the gauntlet of the Ogres.  
 
With this new power Samanosuke must fight through the monster-filled halls of Inabayama Castle. As monsters are defeated, their souls are absorbed by the gauntlet, increasing its power. Some souls restore Samanosuke's health and magic, while others can be used to power up weapons, armor, and items. Powering up weapons will increase their damage and the strength of their associated magic, and is also required to pass by special locks throughout the castle. Items will need to be found in one part of the castle to unlock doors or otherwise bypass obstacles elsewhere in the castle, and sometimes the player will take control of Samanosuke's companion Kaede while Samanosuke is incapacitated in some way. Kaede can reach some locations that are beyond Samanosuke as well as pick locks and throw kunai, but she can not absorb souls or open any lock intended for the wearer of the Ogre gauntlet.</desc>

		<desc>Another village has been brutalized by a host of ghastly creatures. Ten years after Samanosuke Akechi battled a resurrected demon lord in Onimusha, Nobunaga has returned to terrify and oppress innocents across the country. Fortunately a young samurai, Jubei Yagyu, has noticed the spread of evil and resolved to battle the demonic forces wherever he finds them. 
 The famous Japanese actor Yusaku Matsuda, best known in the U.S. for the 1989 movie Black Rain, was the model for Jubei Yagyu. Matsuda died in 1989 of cancer, but returns for a starring role in Onimusha 2. Capcom also hired Keita Amamiya as character designer, director, and illustrator to insure a high-quality product. Onimusha 2 includes twice as many cut-scenes as the original, and the quality of these cut-scenes has been dramatically improved. Action stars were hired to add additional realism.</desc>

Working closely with Williams to ensure authenticity of each of the games, the collection is highlighted by some of the most popular and innovative Williams pinball tables, including Gorgar, the first-ever talking pinball machine, Black Knight, which introduced "Magna-Save" and Bonus Ball, and Space Shuttle, which took the pinball industry by storm in 1984. Every table has been meticulously recreated to bring players the visuals, sound effects and gameplay that made these games legendary successes. Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection harkens back to the arcades of the 1980s. Players begin Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection with access to four pinball tables, and the remaining four tables are unlocked as the game progresses. Players can spend as little as two minutes on a quick pinball challenge, or delve deeper into the game, gaining rewards in a token-based system as they unlock each of the pinball tables. Single-player Arcade and Challenge modes provide hours of solo entertainment, and a Multiplayer mode lets players face each other head-on.</desc>

The Predator's arsenal includes a staff, maul, glaive, explosive mines, spear gun, and a set of claws that appear from the forearm. With those weapons the player is able to skin, slice, stab, crush, and mangle the many enemies in the game, ultimately hunting the alpha male whose skull would make a worthy prize.</desc>

As part of his academic "studies," Raz must enter classmates' minds to solve their problems, ranging from childhood trauma to borderline personality disorders. Accomplishing these feats involves using the character's unusual talents to manipulate the strange worlds created by the subject's mind. 
 Raz literally walks through an individual's fears, delusions, and rage to solve various object-oriented puzzles and to eliminate potential threats. The human brain guards itself against foreigners poking around the subconscious and will manufacture enemies and barriers to stop Raz before he can resolve whatever psychological ailment is plaguing the host. Among the special powers Raz can call upon are invisibility, confusion, mind control, psychic blasts, and telekinesis.</desc>

R-Type Final is designed to bring on the tense, fast-paced feel of the original coin-op game while adding console-friendly features such as customizable ships, multiple difficulty settings, and a mode that allows player to battle against AI-controlled versions of their own ships. Following the four games it introduced stateside in 2002, Fresh Games publishes R-Type Final in the U.S. and Canada, returning to its strategy of bringing distinct Japanese console games to North American gamers.   In R-Type Final, your enemy is the Bydo, an evil (and living) weapon capable of reproducing itself. Humanity has fought the Bydo four times so far, and each time was victorious. However, each time the Bydo appears it is stronger than before, and now it's back and you need to destroy it again!</desc>

		<name>Ratchet &amp; Clank</name>
		<desc>Ratchet &amp; Clank is a platform/adventure game in a similar vein to the 3D versions of the Rayman, Sonic, Mario, or other games. It involves the two protagonists Ratchet, a furry alien creature, and Clank, a nerdy little robot, going on a quest to find Captain Qwark and ultimately to help save the galaxy. 
 
Ratchet &amp; Clank includes many of the best features of previous similar games, but makes itself unique in a number of ways. Firstly each of the game's levels are huge sweeping vistas with extremely detailed buildings which are visible at all times (i.e. there is no distance fog). This means that a building on the horizon is not just a "backdrop"; in all likelihood Ratchet will be exploring it in a few moments time. Secondly, the game includes a number of sub-games, such as a space fight sequence and a number of turret shoot-outs which are akin to Missile Command in the first person. 
 
The game has over twenty levels (planets) and includes as many real-time cut-scenes which tell the story. Also of note is that the story is non-linear, requiring the player to return to previous levels to complete objectives and to choose between multiple paths forward. There is also a respectable array of weapons, gadgets, and accessories to find or buy as the game progresses, which offer some unique gameplay features.</desc>

The storyline involves Ratchet and Clank, along with Al, being kidnapped and forced to compete in a underground reality show called "DreadZone" run by the media mogul Gleeman Vox on the outer fringes of the galaxy.  
 
The game differs from its predecessors in that it focuses more on shooting than platforming and puzzle elements. The game allows you to use two bots to fight along side you, which can be upgraded over time with better weapons and firepower. There is a total of  10 weapons in the game, significantly less than the other games. However, modding these weapons is more emphasized than before, with different kinds of Alpha and Omega mods. Omega mods can be used on any weapon, and range from the freeze mod to the magma mod. Alpha mods are weapon-specific, and increase the rate of fire, ammo capacity, and power. The game also features online multiplayer. 
 
Clank is not a playable character in this game, although he gives advice to Ratchet over his communication link.</desc>

		<desc>This game is a mix of different types of games. It has been described as a fighting, action, and shooter game rolled into one. RPG elements are also apparent as players have the option of upgrading certain attributes of a character depending on how well levels are completed. 
This story is based on The Red Star graphic novel, set in a futuristic, magic-using Soviet Union, which uses floating Skyfurnaces (gigantic magical ships, reminiscent of all-metal blimps) and Warkasters (sorcerers) to conquer its enemies.</desc>

		<name>Resident Evil : Outbreak</name>
		<desc>Resident Evil - Outbreak takes a turn from previous outings in the survival horror series by featuring a multiplayer online component. The narrative is broken down into chapters, allowing up to four players to experience the world of Resident Evil together for the first time. Players initially choose from a lineup of eight characters, six males and two females, who each possess distinct skills or techniques. Some characters may be proficient in a specific style of weapon, while others may be able to open locked doors more efficiently. 
 The choice of characters becomes important since teamwork is often needed to advance through the zombie-filled office buildings, bars, subways, and dilapidated mansions in and around the cursed Raccoon City. One player, for example, may have to distract a group of zombies, while another works on picking a lock or solving a puzzle as quickly as possible. Resident Evil: Outbreak requires a broadband connection in order to play online, but the game also features a single-player mode for those brave enough to go it alone.</desc>

Once again you find yourself playing the eight characters of the original Resident Evil: Outbreak in more scenarios set in the ruins of what used to be Raccoon City. In single player mode you select a character to play and 2 other characters to accompany you. 
 
The new game has several new scenarios and boasts new gameplay developments for the Resident Evil series. Loading times have been reduced and while the previous Outbreak was on-line enabled in the US, this game is the first on-line Resident Evil game in Europe. 
 
The locales featured in this game include both the familiar (The Raccoon Police Department) and the exotic (A mutated jungle at mid-day) ones. The game boasts a hefty amount of unlockable material such as artworks, notes, trivia, and character costumes.  The game is backwards compatible with your save file from Resident Evil: Outbreak, meaning that you can take your unlocked content to this new setting.</desc>

The “Project K” Network has recently been upgraded to handle the rapid expansion of the information age and the core, known as “Eden,” holds the most advanced artificial intelligence the world has ever seen. Unfortunately, Eden cannot handle the ability to create her own thoughts and buckles under the pressure in an existential breakdown. She is lost deep inside the system, and you’re the only one that can bring her back online, saving the world from utter chaos. 
 
You must blast complex viruses, unlock passwords, and destroy firewall bosses as you search for Eden. Each stage is in a constant state of flux dependent on your shooting techniques, which ultimately control the music and colors of your environment. The deeper you get into the dreamlike cyber world of Rez, your form will evolve or devolve depending on your progress.</desc>

		<desc>20 years ago, an alternate World War II occurred, where both Axis and Allies developed mecha technology, known as Armored Fighting Walkers (AFWs). As a result, battles continued in different ways and Russian forces were more instrumental in the eventual defeat of Japan. The end of the war has had Japan divided between  the allied forces, similar to Germany. Japan is now split into a communist North Japan and an Democratic South Japan, governed separately. Without any obvious cause, Japan erupted into civil war between it's halves for four years. Dubbed the "Japan War", it further weakened Japan's economy and fueled resentment between people living in the North and the South. In 1964, Masami von Weizegger is a AFW pilot in the South Japan forces. While field testing a prototype AFW, it is stolen by North Japanese agents and Masami is dispatched to recover the stolen material. As Masami's team attempts to retrieve the AFW, they stumble into a military operation that threatens to erupt into all-out war.</desc>

Taking part in either races, stunt shows, or in one-on-one duels, you'll need to learn not only how to drive, but also when to use power-ups and where the best short cuts are. Power-ups include oil slicks to bombs to a tornado that cleans the course ahead of you. Through the Championship mode, you'll be able to unlock all the vehicles and tracks.</desc>

The island of Argus has plunged into chaos with the abduction of Princess Harmonia at the mighty hands of the Titans. Equipped with a multipurpose shield called the Diskarmor, Rygar sets out to free Princess Harmonia from captivity and restore peace to his home.   As Rygar advances through shrines, coliseums, and mysterious labyrinths, he will develop new moves and abilities. Rygar can learn to slide to squeeze through narrow passageways, stomp on enemies or objects, push or lift items, and use the Diskarmor to hang from ledges, grapple onto objects and then swing across chasms. Attacks involve pressing various button combinations, the result of which vary depending on the Diskarmor's abilities at the time. Rygar can power-up his magical shield and use it as a projectile weapon as well as for defense.</desc>

The game picks up where the movie left off, albeit with the stunning revelation that Montana isn't dead. Montana survives the assassination attempt and vows revenge on the kingpin who nearly put him out of commission: Alejandro Sosa. Players assume the role of power-hungry Montana in his bid to reclaim his cocaine empire and extravagant lifestyle. This, of course, means resorting to graphic violence and colorful profanity as a means of "persuasion."</desc>

		<desc>Shadow of Rome is a third-person, action-adventure game with some elements of racing. The game has two types of gameplay: close quarters combat levels involving Agrippa and stealth-based, puzzle-solving adventure levels involving Octavianus.[2] There are also levels in which Agrippa competes in chariot races.[3] 
Agrippa uses various gladiator weapons to fight, including swords, maces, spears, among others.[3] Agrippa can use special moves such as "Red Volcano"â€”a move used to slice enemies in halfâ€” to please the crowds.[2] As a result, the crowd will throw down items to help Agrippa.[4] Once a weapon is used enough, it will break, and the player will have to find a new one inside the area.[3] 
In Octavianus' levels, the player sneaks around various locations in Rome. Octavianus cannot kill enemies, he can only knock them out. Other ways to pass these levels are by hiding in large pots or by stealing clothes and impersonating someone.[3]</desc>

Developed by the studio that created the PS2's critically acclaimed Ico, Shadow of the Colossus is another fantasy-themed puzzle adventure that's light on dialog and heavy on beautifully expressive environments.   Players take the role of a young knight who sets out to rescue his sleeping-beauty princess from a magic-induced state of suspended animation. To do so, he'll need to defeat the 16 Colossi -- landscape-sized enemies so enormous that they can only be conquered by exploring them, platform-game style, to discover their weaknesses. Against some Colossi, the hero may ride his faithful steed alongside the monster, galloping at full speed just to keep up with its mile-long strides. Other Colossi require the player to actually climb aboard, and crawl, run, and leap across their massive forms to find the hidden vulnerability that can be used to bring them down.</desc>

		<name>The Sims 2</name>
		<desc>The Sims 2 is a 2004 strategic life simulation video game developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts. It is the sequel to the best-selling computer game The Sims. 
 
The game has the same concept as its predecessor: players control their Sims in various activities and form relationships in a manner similar to real life. The Sims 2, like its predecessor, does not have a defined final goal; gameplay is open-ended. Sims have life goals, wants and fears, the fulfillment of which can produce both positive or negative outcomes. All Sims age, and can live to 90 sim days depending on the degree to which their aspirations are fulfilled. The Sims 2 builds on its predecessor by allowing Sims to age through six stages of life and incorporating a 3D graphics engine. Although gameplay is not linear, storylines exist in the game's pre-built neighborhoods. Pleasantview is based 25 years after the town in the original The Sims. Strangetown's storyline is based on the supernatural, and is loosely connected with Pleasantview. Veronaville's characters are based on Shakespearean characters. 
 
The Sims 2 was first released on September 14, 2004 for Microsoft Windows. A port to Mac OS X was released on June 17, 2005. Eight expansion packs and nine stuff packs were subsequently released. In addition several console versions have been released. The Sims 2 is offered on mobile platforms, with manufacturers such as Nokia offering The Sims 2 from the Ovi Store. A sequel, The Sims 3, was released in June 2009. 
 
The Sims 2 was a commercial success, selling one million copies in its first ten days, a record at the time. During April 2008, The Sims 2 website announced that 100 million copies of The Sims series had been sold. The Sims 2 was well received by critics, gaining a 90% score from aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings. By March 2012, The Sims 2 had sold over six million PC copies, and 13 million over all platforms, making it one of the best-selling PC games of all-time.</desc>

		<name>Sniper Elite</name>
		<desc>Sniper Elite is a third-person action strategy game with a focus on sniping. The player takes on the role of an American agent working for the OSS (the organization that later became the CIA) stationed in Berlin at the end of World War II, tasked with preventing the Russian troops from getting hold of the research Germany had been conducting into nuclear weaponry. As an elite sniper, the style of play is much less run-and-gun and much more about finding good positions, lining up shots and taking out the enemy before he even knows where you are. 
 
The single-player campaign takes place over 28 missions set in and around Berlin. Players use stealth tactics, and things like wind and background noise can be a factor when lining up shots. When a shot is performed particularly well, players are rewarded with a 'bullet cam' which follows the bullet in slow-motion from gun barrel to target. It can be played with a friend in local 2-player co-op. Players can revive each other.</desc>

		<desc>The player leads a four-man team (three AI-controlled teammates) of United States Navy SEALs through 12 missions in four regions: Alaska, Thailand, Congo, and Turkmenistan in the years 2006 and 2007. In the single player missions, commands can be spoken using the included USB headset or via an onscreen menu if the optional SOCOM headset was not purchased. Typical missions consist of killing terrorists, rescuing hostages, retrieving intelligence, or destroying terrorist bases. 
 
The player character's codename is Kahuna, while the NPC teammates' codenames are Boomer, Spectre and Jester. The team is divided into two sub-groups, Alpha and Bravo. The Alpha group consists of the player and Boomer, while the remaining two make up Bravo. Commands can be issued to both individuals and a whole group, for example it is possible to ask team Bravo to remain stationary while the player is scouting the area with Boomer. However the player can not venture alone through a map, when Kahuna is too far away from Boomer he will automatically resume following the player, regardless of prior orders. Briefings and intel such as maps and photos are given prior to each mission.</desc>

Combined Assault's campaign mode offers 18 missions. The game takes place solely in the fictional country of Adjekistan. The country is supposedly situated somewhere in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region of Central Asia, featuring a number of different environment and climate zonesâ€”allowing for the game to feature a wide variety of landscapes and settings while working within one large, connected story. The online servers were shut down on August 31, 2012[1] Although the Combined Assault servers were shut down, some gamers still play via LAN using programs like Xlink Kai.[citation needed]</desc>

		<desc>The Suffering: Ties That Bind follows in the footsteps of its predecessor by combining a disturbing horror atmosphere with action/shooter gameplay. Players can switch between third person and first person depending on their preference, and will shoot a lot of hideous demonic manifestations of evil before the game is done. The player is also able to transform into a hideous creature at key times in the game, which allows him to engage in intense melee combat. The game includes a morality system which records the player's actions during gameplay and changes the story accordingly, and also alters the player's creature form. Everything from the first The Suffering has been refined and turned up a notch for the sequel. 
 
The story picks up right where the first game left off. The player once again takes on the role of Torque, former death row inmate with a mysterious past. Now returning to his home town of Baltimore, Torque must confront the mysterious Blackmore, the man who may or may not have killed Torque's family. But it won't be easy, as the hideous creatures from the first game have now overrun the streets of Baltimore. Will Torque finally be able to come to grips with his past?</desc>

		<path>./Suikoden IV (USA).gz</path>
		<name>Suikoden IV</name>
		<desc>An orphan boy was brought up in a noble household on the island of Razril, part of a federation known as the Island Nations, which is threatened by their powerful neighbor, the Kooluk Empire. When the boy grows up, he trains together with other young people, hoping to become a knight in the Gaien order. One day, during an escort mission, the knights' ship is attacked by pirates. Through a series of events, the hero is branded with the Rune of Punishment, one of the twenty-seven legendary True Runes. While devastating the enemies, this rune is also bound to deplete its bearer's life. Blamed for the death of his commander, who was unable to withstand the power of the rune, the young knight is exiled from his homeland. He must find a way to use his powers for the good of the Island Nations, fight against a Kooluk invasion, and restore his honor in the process. 
 
Suikoden IV is a prequel to the entire series. The events of the game take place a hundred and fifty years before those of the first game, and the region of the Suikoden universe they occur in are the islands south of Toran. The game retains many classic features of the series: the ability to recruit 108 characters (Stars of Destiny);  building and customization of army headquarters (this time a large ship instead of a castle); emphasis on political issues in the story; the ability to equip runes of various kinds in combat that allow the usage of magic spells, etc.  
 
The amount of active combatants in the party has been reduced from six to four in this installment. Once again, there are three types of combat in the game: the most frequent turn-based party-vs.-party combat, duels, and tactical battles, which now take place on sea. The player can customize the the naval forces by choosing captains and commanding officers, and assigning to them runic elements. Each element has strengths and weaknesses to another one, and the player must use them tactically to gain the upper hand. Ship placement on the battle grid and attack angles play a role as well. 
 
New to the series is ship navigation - instead of exploring an overworld on foot, the player navigates a ship, discovering new lands and islands. Also for the first time in the series there is voice acting, a fully rotatable camera, and the possibility to navigate the main character from first-person perspective.</desc>

		<desc>Theme Park World (known as Sim Theme Park in the United States and Brazil and Theme Park Rollercoaster on the PS2 in America) is a construction and management simulation game, and is a sequel to the 1994 video game Theme Park. Theme Park World was developed by Bullfrog Productions and released by Electronic Arts in 1999. Initially developed for Windows, it was later ported to PlayStation and PlayStation 2, as well for Macintosh computers.[2] The Mac version was published by Feral Interactive. A PC expansion, titled Theme Park World: Gold Edition, adds several new rides and attractions. 
 
Although it has no connection with Maxis' Sim titles, both Maxis and Bullfrog are owned by Electronic Arts, so it was identified as part of the Sim series by Electronic Arts. It was followed by Theme Park Inc (also known as Sim Coaster) in 2000/2001.</desc>

Upon securing the facility, Blake is airlifted to the Norwegian research station to locate and reinforce Alpha Team after Colonel Whitely informs him that they have lost contact with the team. There Blake and his group encounter swarms of Things that slowly dwindle down his team as Blake rescues Colin and learns of a government conspiracy with Gen Inc in conducting experiments on the alien lifeforms before they began to infest the research facility. Blake learns that Whitely was behind it the whole time and even injected himself with a Cloud Virus B4 Strain. With a new group, Blake fights his way through numerous black ops and creatures before killing the transformed Whitley. The player has the assistance of a helicopter pilot, revealed to be R.J. MacReady, the hero from the original film. The ending is ambiguous, and there is speculation that MacReady is, in fact infected.</desc>

		<name>Time Crisis : Crisis Zone</name>
		<desc>Crisis Zone is a spin-off of the popular Time Crisis arcade shooters, released in 29 March 1999 in the arcades. 
 
A PlayStation 2 (PS2) remake of the game was released in 2004 in the UK and the US with more detailed polygons and textures, higher difficulty, redone voice acting and an additional mission taking place six months after the Crisis Zone Arcade mode. 
 
The PS2 port is compatible with the GunCon (G-Con 45 in Europe) and Guncon 2 lightgun, and is available with an unusual two-player cooperative gameplay mode named "two-gun mode" by allowing two players to play simultaneously on a single-player mode without the use of split-screen, or weapon switching system (similar to Time Crisis 3, with some changes) allowing the player to switch between a fully automatic machine gun, a standard 8-round handgun and a 6-round shotgun, depending on settings. 
 
Unlike Time Crisis 3 and Time Crisis 4, where only the handgun has unlimited ammunition and other weapons are replenished by shooting certain enemies, all weapons now have unlimited ammunition in Crisis Zone, though they all must be reloaded. As with the PlayStation 2 version of Time Crisis II and Time Crisis 3, players can access the Crisis Mission exercise menu through prolonged gameplay. The US version of the PS2 remake is called Time Crisis: Crisis Zone.</desc>

Each zone contains three portals, each of which lead to a level.[4] The goal of each level is to obtain a select amount of thunder eggs, which can be retrieved by either performing a certain task, completing a "Time Attack" challenge that can be unlocked upon said level's completion, freeing five bilbies,[2] a group of animals who raised Ty after his parents were imprisoned, or by being found alongside the level's set path.[2] A level is cleared either by collecting a select amount of thunder eggs and reaching the end of the path, or beating certain min-games, each will return Ty to Rainbow Cliffs hub world.[2] Retrieving a thunder egg in a level will cause it to appear on the game's pause menu.[5] When at least seventeen thunder eggs in a zone are obtained, the player must navigate their way to the talisman machine; after the machine manages to locate a talisman, it opens another portal leading to their original locations; inside these portals, the player must fight and defeat a boss character before gaining access to a new zone</desc>

While most of the game is standard platform fare, there are some diversions. Notably, there are a number of cart racing tracks which can be played with a friend. Additionally, there are missions that will place the player in giant robots, each with a different speciality (one is good at battle, one can put out fires, one is a submarine, etc.). 
 
There are many comedic quirks, having the players throw electrified boomerangs at robotic dinosaurs in the Outback, then send them up in a helicopter to rescue sheep stranded by a flood, then have them clear a road following a traffic accident. And finally, to top it all off, the save/continue points are outhouses.</desc>

		<name>Urban Chaos : Riot Response</name>
		<desc>In Urban Chaos: Riot Response, you play as Nick Mason, a member of a new anti-terrorist team named T-Zero. Terrorists and gang members have destroyed your city, and your goal is to bring order back to the city while destroying any terrorists and gang members you encounter. Since your enemies are armed to the teeth (usually with meat cleavers, Molotov cocktails, and sawed-off shotguns), you're equipped with a riot shield that can be used by holding the left trigger. It can absorb an infinite amount of projectiles, but you cannot shoot while you are using it. You can get the assistance of firefighters to put out fires, and medics to replenish your health. 
 
Your weapons can be upgraded by earning medals during your missions. You can earn these medals by scoring headshots, arresting enemies with your taser (as opposed to killing them), collecting gang masks, etc. You can even unlock extra missions and weapons by arresting gang leaders at the end of each level, so that the police can interrogate him and find out the gang's next move.</desc>

		<name>Valkyrie Profile 2 : Silmeria</name>
		<desc>Hundreds of years before Lenneth's tale, another saga lies concealed by the gods. The valkyrie Silmeria once served Odin loyally, but after an incident ignited a conflict between them, Odin forcefully reincarnated her as a human. The human soul that would carry her spirit was that of Alicia, Princess of Dipan. Ordinarily, Silmeria-s consciousness would have been sealed, her spirit dormant until she was next summoned... However, the forced transmigration causes Silmeria's spirit to awaken within Alicia, leaving two souls to inhabit a single body. The spirit that should have been sealed has awakened-a situation Odin will not ignore for long. This installment introduces the new Photon Action System to the classic side-scrolling action format found in the original. Projecting photons grants players more freedom to explore and expands the action, resulting in challenging puzzles with clever solutions. Add to that "sealstones" that affect the laws of nature in dungeons, launching strategy to new heights. The unique battle system of the previous game has evolved into the Advanced Tactical Combination Battle System.</desc>

		<desc>Wakeboarding is part of Activision's line of Extreme Sports titles. A rider (using a board that's like a combination of a surf board, body board and skateboard) is pulled along the water by rope at high speeds by the boat up front, and must pull of tricks either by jumping of jumps or using the wake left by the boat itself (hence the sport's name). 
 
Unleashed takes this sport and turns it upside down, allowing you to fly down water ways through well known locations around the world, pulling stunts off buildings or cliff faces. Other objectives are included that have you completing tasks and busting tricks in a unique way. 
 
Multiplayer modes include one-on-one trick attack and horse, where both players compete against each other to pull off the best tricks. Co-operative mode has one player driving the boat while the other hangs on behind, with new challenges for the boat driver to complete as well as the rider.</desc>

Players take command of three unlikely companions in a surreal and desolate world called Filgaia. The young orphan Rudy has a unique ability to physically bond with "ARMs," or "Ancient Relic Machines," which seem to have been left behind by a forgotten civilization. The runaway princess Cecelia can command forces of magic, and the swordsman Jack is adept at a number of trades. These three "Dream Chasers" seek their fortunes in the unforgiving countryside, and might just end up saving the whole world along the way. The role-playing adventure includes overworld exploration and intense dungeon-crawling. Wild ARMs: Alter Code F is compatible with the PlayStation 2 HDD, so veteran PS2 gamers with older model consoles and the hard drive accessory can load the large, two-DVD game program to disk in order to decrease load times.</desc>

		<name>Wild Arms 3</name>
		<desc>The first two games in the Wild Arms series garnered attention and acclaim as they brought classic console role-playing to the original PlayStation. Though crafted in the same story-telling spirit, Wild Arms 3 (titled Wild Arms Advanced 3rd in Japan) boasts major technological improvements and a number of new gameplay elements. Featuring "stroke-shaded" animation-style graphics, a "Wild West" setting, and a completely 3D game engine (not just for battles, as in the previous games), Wild Arms 3 is designed to make good use of the power of the PlayStation 2. 
 
Wild Arms 3 features four main characters and takes the time to let players become acquainted with each of them. The "drifters" Virginia, Gallows, Jet, and Clive are four very different adventurers whose paths intertwine toward a shared destiny. Though each has his or her own personal motivations, all four seek an explanation for why the once-verdant lands of Filgaia have become dry and barren. Differences must be overcome and the characters must act in harmony if they are to truly understand the ancient mystical forces at work. 
 
As the drifters move through the desolate land of Filgaia, they are challenged with a number of mysteries to solve and barriers to overcome. The different special abilities of each character must be used to solve different parts of the game's complex puzzles. A technique dubbed "expressive communication" is designed to allow players to quickly gauge the moods and emotions of the onscreen characters. Monsters, villains, and other horrible creatures stand between the drifters and their destinations as well. The Wild Arms 3 turn-based battle system is designed to offer players an intricate level of control, allowing tactics that make wise use of the various powers and weaponry of the drifters while presenting combat with cinematic flair. 
 
 
Wild Arms 3 delivers everything RPG gamers expect: an in-depth storyline, puzzling dungeons &amp; a unique battling system. Journey along with Virginia, Jet, Clive and Gallows and discover the mystery behind the Prophets to revive the memories of Filgaia. Explore dungeons to unlock secret pathways and find mythical treasures. Gun Blazing shoot-outs deliver intense cinematic battles. Wild Arms 3 embodies tried-and-true elements of a role-playing classic.</desc>

But one day, your world is shattered to pieces, and you descend onto the earth to face the terrible reality: the world of Filgaia was devastated by wars. A few settlements amidst rusty tanks is all that is left of civilization. The democratically elected government has some plans for improving the conditions of the world, but as you meet a young girl whom they used as a tool for their purpose, you realize you must find a better plan to save her, and the world, from complete destruction. 
 
The fourth installment of the Wild Arms series abandons its traditional Wild West theme and is set in a post-apocalyptic world. The gameplay system introduces hex-based battles. Battle screens are divided into seven hexes, each one of which can hold several party members or foes. You navigate your characters on the battle field, trying to force the enemy into an uncomfortable position. There is also a variety of skills you can learn and apply in battles to get benefits. As in previous Wild Arms games, the dungeons contain many environmental puzzles to solve.</desc>

		<name>WinBack 2 : Project Poseidon</name>
		<desc>In a world where terror takes many forms, a new weapon threatens to shake the balance of power. Freedom's last hope rests in the hands of three new operatives, who must race against time to recover this doomsday device. The fate of the world hangs by a thread, and a few ticks of the clock means the difference between justice and annihilation. WINBACK 2 brings to the series a new "route" system that lets players experience each mission from the perspective of different operatives. There are 30 intense missions, multiple difficulty levels, and new weapons including the highly-anticipated sniper rifle. The new Winback assault team is comprised of three young, yet combat-proven operatives led by Craig Contrell. Each team member is qualified in six different weapon types and highly-adept at CQB (Close Quarter Battle). They are masters of target identification, engagement and shot placement. In the hands of the player, all of these techniques will be put to the test. The game's unique shooting action is spread across 30 high-risk operations situated in challenging urban environments and conveyances.</desc>

		<name>WipEout Fusion</name>
		<desc>WipEout Fusion is a futuristic racing game with action elements. Playing compete in the F9000 Anti-Gravity Race League, driving hovercrafts and sometimes using weapons against opponents to achieve victory. 
 
Like WipEout 3, the game contains single-race and league modes, as well as two-player split screen gameplay. The single race mode (called Arcade) is used to unlock new tracks. The challenge mode from WipEout 64 returns with a few enhancements: each team has its own set of six challenges, which must be completed with a medal in order to unlock the next one. A new Zone mode requires players to drive as many loops as possible on a track while continuously increasing the speed. 
Another new feature in WipEout Fusion are hovercraft upgrades. Depending on their performance, players receive credits after races, which can be used to increase speed, thrust, weapon power, shield strength, lateral stability, and brake force of a vehicle. Upgraded vehicles can be used in any other game mode, with the exception of the Challenge mode.</desc>

X Squad is a third-person 3D squad-based shooter. The player directly controls Ash; his three companions are controlled by the AI, but the player can issue general orders to them. Ash can crouch and roll to evade enemy fire. The gameplay is predominantly action-oriented; Ash and his friends have to deal with enemy soldiers, automated guns, and boss enemies. Other tasks are usually confined to hitting switches in order to open doors.</desc>

		<name>Xenosaga Episode I : Der Wille zur Macht</name>
		<desc>Xenosaga: Episode I - Der Wille zur Macht, the first chapter of a trilogy, is a Japanese-style sci-fi role-playing game, sharing many common themes and gameplay elements with Xenogears. The battle system is not unlike the one used in Xenogears (combo attacks, AP and EP gauges, etc.), but random encounters are eliminated. Instead, the enemies are now visible and battles can be avoided. During combat the few upcoming ally and enemy turns are shown onscreen, allowing the player to make strategic decisions based on who will act next. A rolling slot moves with each turn as well, conferring a bonus such as added damage or bonus XP for any action on that turn. If the enemy would be in position to take an advantage then the player can expend a character's "boost" gauge to cut in and act next, although enemies can boost as well, and enemy boosts always over-ride player boosts.  
 
Each character has a unique tree of Ether spells they can learn by spending Ether points earned in battle, with lower spells requiring spells above them to be purchased first. After a spell is purchased, so long is it does not require a unique talent of that character, the spell can also be purchased and learned by any other character that can afford double its normal cost. The Anti-Gnosis Weapon Systems can be equipped with different weapons and accessories and can be used in combat provided that a character has enough AP on that turn to board their AGWS.</desc>

When he is attacked by BAHRAM forces who have come to seize it, Dingo climbs into Jehuty and engages the attackers.

As a prisoner, Dingo is assaulted by Ken Marinaris, a female Orbital Frame runner that Dingo defeated in the previous battle. Nohman arrives moments later and asks Dingo to join him. When Dingo refuses, Nohman shoots him, ordering Ken to dispose of the body. Instead, Ken has Dingo revived and placed inside Jehuty. When he comes to, she explains that Jehuty is acting as a life-support system, and if he leaves Jehuty, he will die. She then tells him that she is a UNSF spy. Dingo escapes with Taper and heads for Mars.</desc>

		<name>Rumble Roses</name>
		<desc>Konami rolls out a wrestling game for the PS2 where players control an all-vixen cast looking to suplex, dropkick, and fling mud in the faces of their opponents. Rumble Roses features 11 scantly clad, and at times very dirty, female characters. In Mud Mode, players will take on their opponents in a mud wrestling match designed to reveal more than just wrestling expertise. Classic wrestling moves are available, such as suplexes, kicks, and flying elbows, as well as the ability for players to taunt and insult their opponents, which can provide advantages in the ring. 
 A "Super Star" system can offer advantages as well, based on a character's popularity with the crowd. Players are encouraged to develop a persona for their character, and different special moves become available depending on whether they choose to fight dirty or clean in the ring.</desc>

		<name>Flipnic : Ultimate Pinball</name>
		<desc>A pinball game with multiple twists. Flipnic isn't your basic pinball game, it's a psychedelic trip through fantastic land of pinball. The game features multiple tables in which the player must complete a given set of tasks before he can proceed to the next level. Each of the "tables" consists of many smaller playing areas and every one has some gimmick in them. For example, one must first freeze the waterfall and then destroy the ice and climb a mountain behind it. All this using only the paddles and the ball. 
 This latter-day pinball game for PS2 is designed to offer a wide variety of game modes, contemporarily cutting-edge graphics, and surrealistic action. The game's main mode features over 100 missions, in more than 70 game levels, on five differently themed tables -- Biology, Metallurgy, Optics, Geometry, and Theology. "Free Play" and two-player mini-game modes are also available. Developed at Sony Computer Entertainment's Japanese headquarters, Flipnic flips Stateside thanks to Capcom.</desc>

		<desc>Air out the tights, slip on the mask, don the cape, and prepare to flex some muscles in Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, an action role-playing game featuring the largest cast of costumed crusaders and mutant messiahs in a video game to date. Twenty Marvel superheroes have joined forces to combat the diabolical Dr. Doom and his Masters of Evil. The action will take players to Atlantis, the Skrull home world, the S.H.I.E.L.D. Heli-Carrier, and more as they guide a four-person party through 17 comic book-inspired locales. Moves include a flurry of air and ground strikes, from grapples and blocks to chargeable powers and deadly combos. Objects within the environment can also cause damage, and a choice of one- and two-handed weapons can help less extraordinary heroes mete out justice against throngs of enemies.</desc>

		<name>Tekken Tag Tournament</name>
		<desc>Forget the fancy full-motion video intros of the past. The cutting-edge gameplay that is promised in the extended intros of fighting games is finally realised in Tekken Tag Tournament This visually stunning action game contains fully rendered 3-D characters who can execute smoothly animated martial-arts moves. With polygonal characters and texture maps this real, you will end up looking for the coin slot on your PS2.    With more than 30 characters to fight against or beside, this game allows you to pull off the ultimate human combo: tag-team fighting. By choosing two fighters who have broadly divergent skills, you can increase your threat to the other fighters greatly. Also, switching out fighters can give an overextended partner enough time to rest up his or her stamina for the next tag. See what happens when one partner throws a foe, tags, and the other partner comes in to keep the foe... uh... airborne. Tekken Tag Tournament contains 20 classic characters from other parts of the acclaimed Tekken series, as well as 12 new characters who can be unlocked during gameplay.</desc>

		<name>Aliens Versus Predator : Extinction</name>
		<desc>The battle that has split more blood over centuries continues, with the human marines caught in-between the powerful Aliens and the deadly Predators. 
 
Moving away from the FPS series on PC, Extinction has you controlling one of the three races in a real time strategy mix, building each unit and setting them out into the battlefield to complete a range of tasks. 
 
Each race has an advantage and disadvantage. The humans have a collection of different units, from heavy weapons experts to medics, and are better known for their long range attacks. Predators are hardcore fighters, taking the battle right up to the enemy, although there are fewer of them available to counter act their superior power. Finally, the Aliens are fast and deadly, and always hunt in large packs. 
 
Upgrade weapons and use terrain to an advantage in each level to make certain your team (whoever or whatever they may be) survive until the next battle.</desc>

		<path>./Fire Pro Wrestling Returns (USA).gz</path>
		<name>Fire Pro Wrestling Returns</name>
		<desc>Fire ProWrestling Returns is a 2D-graphic based wrestling simulation game. The game has a north-south/east-west-axis movement system. This allows for dual-plane movement rendering it to play like a 3D wrestling game (although the moves are still done in 2D). 
 
The game features 327 wrestlers on the main roster, from over 10 major Japanese wrestling and mixed-martial arts organizations. This in-depth roster allows the player to simulate classic matches or matches that could never take place. 
 
Game modes include a standard exhibition match, tag team exhibition match with 2, 3 or 4 player teams, a round robin league tournament featuring up to 64 wrestlers, a sudden elimination tournament featuring up to 16 wrestlers, mixed martial arts matches aka Ultimate Fighting (with either Pride or K*1 Rules), battle royal matches with up to eight players in the ring at the same time, 5-man team elimination matches and for the first time ever in a Fire ProWrestling game, a North American cage match mode. 
 
The edit mode allows you to create wrestlers, referees and even entire wrestling organizations (with their own ring and logo). This mode features over 1,648 moves and holds you can assign to your wrestlers, and you can then tweak their CPU logic, so as to make them behave as you like when controlled by the computer. 
 
The new features for the Fire ProWrestling series debuting in Fire ProWrestling Returns are North American cage matches, face layering on edit mode, and ring seconds (aka managers) that accompany wrestlers to the ring. It also features over 20 brand new moves, including some reanimations of old moves.</desc>
