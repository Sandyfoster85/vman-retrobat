		<desc>Konami rolls out a wrestling game for the PS2 where players control an all-vixen cast looking to suplex, dropkick, and fling mud in the faces of their opponents. Rumble Roses features 11 scantly clad, and at times very dirty, female characters. In Mud Mode, players will take on their opponents in a mud wrestling match designed to reveal more than just wrestling expertise. Classic wrestling moves are available, such as suplexes, kicks, and flying elbows, as well as the ability for players to taunt and insult their opponents, which can provide advantages in the ring. 
 A "Super Star" system can offer advantages as well, based on a character's popularity with the crowd. Players are encouraged to develop a persona for their character, and different special moves become available depending on whether they choose to fight dirty or clean in the ring.</desc>

		<name>Stuntman : Ignition</name>
		<desc>Stuntman: Ignition is a game based on the original 2002 Stuntman game. Players assume the role of a Hollywood stunt driver working for a movie studio. Each level is based upon a movie and players will have to drive through the level, earning points by performing stunts. After the end of each level, players can review their performance by watching the movie trailer that was created. 
 
There are six movies to choose from, each with different settings, goals and challenges: Aftershock, Whoopin and a Hollerin' II, Strike Force Omega, Overdrive, Never Kill Me Again and Night Avenger. Each movie consists of 6 scenes where the goals set by the director must be followed. To progress, a successful series of stunts is required, but the amount of points can be increased by linking them together and adding extra danger by drifting, getting airborne, or getting close to other cars and obstacles. 
 
The multiplayer portion offers 2 game modes. In Backlot Battle players have to perform as many stunts as possible in a set amount of laps. Backlot Race offers straightforward racing where boost is earned through stunts. The PS2 version only offers offline gameplay, while the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions have multiplayer supported through the DemonWare middleware.</desc>

Then take your fighter to career mode where you'll play fight your way up from the local gym all the way up to five-star venues. Get trainers to enhance your training and boost your speed and power. Play against randomly generated fighters all the way up through the ranks till you beat them in points or to a pulp. Certain fights may get you a bit of extra money as an incentive, or give you a promotional deal, but pick your fights carefully because strategy inside the ring won't matter if you mismanage your fisher outside.

Once you've got the computer down for the count, you can play with any fighter or user created fighters or any of the ESPN Classic fights in local multiplayer with a friend. You can also take the fight online and prove your the real champion of the world against any opponent anytime, anywhere.</desc>

Each NPC has an individual set of wants, needs, and worries; it's up to players to learn what these are and use them to their advantage. Player characters can improve their social skills with each successful encounter, acquiring a better sense of humor, civility, culture, or other social attribute which could make future encounters even more beneficial.</desc>

Regardless of the mode chosen, once in the air the player will have control over speed, direction, altitude, gun cannon, missiles and special weapon of their aircraft. A new feature from previous Ace Combat games, is the concept of Wingmen and being able to issue simple orders to them in the air. This allows the player to better coordinated group attacks as well as giving each wingman a personality of their own. Additionally, the player as squadron leader will be asked to make decisions ("Yes/No") while flying in the air. Between missions, the story is progressed through a series of cutscenes.</desc>

		<desc>Cookie and Cream are two cartoon bunnies who are on their way home on the night before their clan's yearly moon festival only to find out that the moon has decided to run away, and if Cookie and Cream aren't able to find it, there will never be another festival. Fearing this, the duo sets out to make sure that it doesn't come true. 
 
The Adventures of Cookie &amp; Cream is designed for cooperative gameplay with two players. The goal of each level is to get to the end in a limited amount of time.  
There is basically a straight road from A to B where the players have to overcome obstacles in their way. This includes standard platforming or puzzles which need both players to solve, e.g. one has to press a button so that the other can progress. Because the way is not the same for both characters the game uses a split-screen view. Power-ups increase the time limits but certain obstacles decrease it again if touched. There are overall 35 levels. 
 
It is possible to play the game alone but then the player has to control both characters at once. The game also features a unique 4-player mode where each character is controlled by two people and one joypad.</desc>

		<desc>Borne in the same vein as titles such as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and even Z-Axis' own Dave Mirra Freestyle BMX, Aggressive Inline is an extreme inline skating title with an emphasis on tricks, combos, and outlandish stunts. The game offers ten professional skaters to choose from in addition to a handful of original characters. In Career mode, players can select a virtual avatar from the likes of Jaren Grob, Taig Khris, Chris Edwards, Franky Morales, Sven Boekhorst, Sam Fogarty, Matt Lindenmuth, Matt Salerno, Eito Yasutoko, and Shane Yost and take him through seven levels, with the aim of improving skills and attributes along the way. 
 Each character has a rating in seven different categories, ranging from jump to speed to wallride. By repeatedly performing specific tricks and moves, the relative attributes will gain more character points than other less-used attributes. Continued use of specific moves will thus improve the skill of your chosen skater.</desc>

 Familiar characters return, and players will still find the games' assortment of unlockable power-ups and special equipment as useful as ever, but in Pumped &amp; Primed they may spend as much time racing through platform levels and duking it out in chaotic melee battles as they will sneaking up on escaped apes.  
 Ape Escape: Pumped &amp; Primed offers two main modes of play. The "Story" mode leads players through over 40 levels of athletically themed action, with eight boss battles. The "Versus" mode is designed for two to four (with a Multi-tap accessory) players, and presents more than 20 tournament-style party game challenges.</desc>

A large arsenal of gadgets can be used to make it all a little easier, with the catching net being the most important weapons of them all. Other gadgets include a RC Car, to drive over monkey's and collect objects, an Ape Radar, to detect the nearest monkey, a baseball bat, to hit monkeys unconscious, and a magnet, to move certain objects in the maps. 
 
Your quest is to catch all monkeys in the levels and to stop the evil Specter from taking over the world. All monkeys in the levels are somewhat unique with their own character abilities and their unique name. Some monkeys just sit on their place, while others attack you with projectiles or run away quickly.</desc>

Even the previous heroes of the series - Jimmy, Spike, and the professor - are all caught up in the insidious TV shows.

Kei and Yumi take the lead as the new heroes. Their quest is to capture all 400 monkeys. You control either Kei or Yumi. The gameplay involves using various methods and weapons to catch them all. The game has many levels with different themes, such as a Haunted Castle, a Racing level, Jungle settings, TV studios and other settings. You can slow the animals down with various objects such as a stun club or a slingback shooter, and then you can capture them with a net. 

New to the series are the morphing abilities, eight in all. You can morph into various characters, like a knight and perform a powerful attack or a gun fighter and shoot em up or a ninja and run along walls. You can also vehicles such as a race car to knock down the monkeys. Other features are the familiar Monkeypedia and the unlockable Mesal Gear Solid mini-game (a Metal Gear Solid spoof).</desc>

Frylock had been admitted into the prestigious and exclusive Jersey Pines golf course... while Shake was rejected (he didn't actually apply, but that doesn't stop him from complaining about it). So, Shake decides to challenge Frylock in a game of golf just to prove that he's just as worthy as Frylock to be playing on that golf course. Who cares that Shake has no clue how to play golf? He's angry. 
 
The game plays like a mix between a quite simplified golf simulator, an action game and has golf cart racing elements thrown in for good measure. 
 
The game features lots of extras as well, such as 4 full episodes of the show (one of which is unaired), artwork and movie clips.</desc>

Long ago people had built up a great civilization under the guidance of the goddesses the Trio of Elemia, but over the years things have changed; there were two disasters that have lead towards the destruction of the world. In the first disaster most of the lands and skies were lost, in the second the super civilization was lost; now in the third era another disaster is beginning. Viruses born in the Altar of Apostles have begun to appear, though normally not in physical form have now taken on the form of monsters and could destroy the world. In the upper levels of the Tower is a city called Platina where the Knights of Elemia reside; their job is to control virus outbreaks to preserve the tower. One such knight is Lyner Barsett; the main character of the story, he will need to go on a quest to find the Hymn Crystal which can save the Tower of Ar tonelico and the whole world.</desc>

Players become a hunter who must travel the world and take on jobs, usually revolving around taking out enemies in real time using magic and special abilities. Collect cards from battle and events and equip them to gain new skills, all the while following an RPG-like storyline. You view the action from overhead, with a camera zooming in and out depending on the intensity of the action and occasionally switching to other angles for dramatic effect. You attack enemies in real time, tapping X once for a simple attack and repeatedly for a combo. You can also guard against attack, dash at an enemy, and press a button to run about the play field faster. The game places heavy emphasis on magic use, with the magic meter recovering automatically and quickly following each spell.</desc>

		<desc>Arc: Twilight of the Spirits is the fourth entry in the Arc the Lad series. Like its two immediate predecessors, the game has tactical battles which allow free positioning and movement of the characters on the combat field. However, the game is closer to being a "regular" Japanese-style role-playing game rather than a tactical RPG. The player controls a relatively small party (up to six active combatants), and is able to explore towns and dungeons in a standard RPG fashion. In the beginning, the game puts the player into control of Kharg, but afterwards the chapters alternate between the human hero and Darc, each with his own party. Characters can use a variety of techniques, accumulating SP (spirit points) in battles and them using them to learn special attacks.</desc>

		<name>Area 51</name>
		<desc>Inspired by the 1995 coin-op by Atari Games, which featured alien-blasting action with a light gun peripheral, Area 51 on PlayStation 2 once again finds players deep within the mysterious military base. Players assume the role of Lt. Nick Cross, a biohazard expert sent to investigate the strange happenings inside the famed research center. Cross soon resents his assignment, however, after being infected by a virus of alien origin. Now he finds himself slowly developing new abilities as a result of the alien DNA strands bonding with his own. Area 51 has been redesigned as a first-person shooter without the weapon peripheral, meaning players are free to explore the top-secret installation on their own without following a scripted path. 
 Of course, players will be armed to the hilt with high-powered rifles, infrared sights, grenades, and various other tools of the trade. Along the way, secrets will be revealed in the areas of alien autopsies, cover-ups involving lunar landings, and experimental work on advanced technology like cloaking devices. With newfound superhuman strength and other biological enhancements courtesy of the virus, Nick Cross must battle aliens, soldiers, and other surprises while also solving puzzles. Area 51's creatures were designed by Stan Winston Studio, the effects team behind such films as Aliens, Predator, and Jurassic Park.</desc>

		<desc>The genuine sequel to the original Armored Core. Thrown into the world of AC mechs, you must complete the objectives set for you by a range of different companies, each with a hefty pay packet attached.

The collection of items to upgrade your mech is fully stocked with weapons, defense systems, rocket packs and guidance systems to increase accuracy and speed.

Once your mech is ready for battle, you can also take on a friend in arena mode, where one-on-one battles rage on for as long as you wish in huge outdoor areas.</desc>

Through 15 stages, you engage in fast paced all-action gameplay that features multiple mission objectives. Shoot your way through Colombian drug lords, Russian mobsters, and even dirty cops. Sometimes you will need to protect your computer controlled partner or collect some evidence.  You can often duck behind a wall or around a corner, from where you will be able to pick off your targets with less chance of being hit. You will be accordingly rewarded on your successful actions and achievements on a "Bad Boy" rating system. You can follow all the laws and avoid unneccesary damage or take the opposite approach and be a Bad Boy. There's a good amount of different weapons from pistols and shotguns to automatic assault rifles and grenades. Environments are fully destructable. You can use a quick aiming and shooting Action mode, or search for clues and evidence using the Explore mode.</desc>

Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance II can be played solo or cooperatively with one other player, each choosing from 5 playable characters. The gameplay is the same as its previous incarnation: kill monsters and bad guys to collect treasure, items, and experience. By talking to townspeople in Baldur's Gate the player can learn of optional maps filled with more dangerous monsters and additional treasure. Equipment can be enchanted by the player this time, and given various magical effects such as additional fire damage, absorbing mana, or boosting stats.</desc>

		<name>The Bard's Tale</name>
		<desc>The Bard is a cynical, opportunistic musician who roams the country in search of carnal pleasures. However, this impatient and selfish fellow is compelled to accept the greatest quest of his life: save the princess Caleigh from a demonic cult that has kidnapped her. The unlikely hero must now explore the land in search of the princess, accompanied by the omnipresent Narrator who obviously can't stand the Bard and uses every opportunity to sarcastically comment on his actions. Furthermore, Fionnaoch, the mysterious abductor of the princess, does everything he can to stop the Bard, sending his minions after him. 
 
A self-proclaimed "quest for coin and cleavage", The Bard's Tale is an action RPG that is more of a whimsical take on role-playing games than a remake of the classic series. As the Bard, players can fight off hordes of foes with blade and bow, and summon companions through magical Bard Songs. Leveling up allows the player to raise the character's main attributes and invest specialization points in the different types of weapons he can use. Magical companions must be sought out and then summoned during battles. After being summoned, they act pretty much like AI-controlled party members; some of them specialize in physical attacks and offensive spells, while others can heal the hero. 
 
During conversations the player can choose "nice" or "snarky" responses for the protagonist. While mostly used for humorous effect, some of these responses may affect subsequent events. The game uses the Dark Alliance engine and has a similar camera and control scheme.</desc>

		<desc>On Mars, a battle wages on between the race of mice, known as the Martian Freedom Fighters, and the invading Catatonian Empire. Both sides are fighting for the rights of one important machine: the Regenerator. This machine has the ability to terraform Mars, creating a safehaven for all mice. The Catatonians wish to claim it so they can take over the planet. Freedom Fighter General Stoker is the only one who knows how to build the Regenerator. As a result, he is not present on the battlefield, but is instead on Earth looking for molecules vital to the device's construction. 
 
The mice later mysteriously lose contact with Stoker, so another general, Carbine, sends the Biker Mice from Mars. After their arrival, they land in Chicago and meet up with Charley Davidson, who runs and owns the Last Chance Garage, which becomes the Biker Mice's base of operations. Not long afterwards do they realize the Catatonians, led by General Hairball and Cataclysm, have come to Earth in search of Stoker, so that they can ensure their claim of the Regenerator. Evil billionaire Ronaldo Rump (a parody of Donald Trump and Ricky Ricardo with an oversized butt) also seeks Stoker, since he owns a Regenerator of his own, and uses it for his evil money-making schemes, but it is running low on power.</desc>

		<desc>Newton's third law is put to the test in Black, a first-person shooter from the development team behind the acclaimed Burnout franchise. Players are cast in the role of Jack Kelar, member of an elite tactical squad, whose team is assigned to Eastern Europe on a hunt for an American traitor. Rather than slinking through environments making quick, covert strikes, players in Black perform a full-on assault through nine levels of explosive action. 
 A total of 13 cutting-edge weapons are available to eliminate the enemy threat, but the most distinguishing aspect of Black is its physics engine: fully destructible environments allow players the freedom to shoot inanimate targets as well as live ones. Instead of firing at a patrol of soldiers, for example, players can instead target nearby vehicles or barrels to trigger explosions, shoot out windows and balconies, and more. As Kelar blasts through the besieged cities, snow-covered wilderness, and other levels, shell casings, glass, dust, and debris will fly across the screen as plumes of smoke and raging fires dot the war-torn landscapes.</desc>

The player controls from behind Kain's shoulder and can move him in different directions, attack, jump, use "dark gifts" and grab on to ledges. Kain's life energy steadily depletes and must be replenished constantly by drinking blood. Blood is found by consuming any living creature nearby, often requiring defeating an enemy through combat first. As Kain consumes blood, his meter is filled up. Once full, Kain gains additional health. Kain also learns new dark gifts throughout the game, by defeating boss creatures. Some gifts include: the ability to blend into mist, fire projectiles, use projectile telekinesis or make a great horizontal leap. Many of these abilities can be used to perform "stealth kills" which will instantly defeat a foe. Kain will fight using his bare hands, or by picking up daggers, swords, axes and other weapons. These weapons all attack differently, eventually breaking, and can also be thrown at enemies from afar.</desc>

		<desc>During the XGC (X-Genome Code) Incident one year ago, riots raged over the earth by beasts that did not show the XCG, and all over the country small earthquakes shook the land. The cause was unknown, but as the Crest Incident came to an end and the rioting and earthquakes subsided, people began to claim that all was due to the influence of the Stone Seal. Although the Stone Seal has been locked away, the rioting and earthquakes have returned. This time, the incidents are on a larger scale than those of a year ago. What could be behind it all?    Bloody Roar 4 is the last title in the series, and is once again a full-3D fighting game featuring the series' trademark transformation abilities. Unlike previous titles in the series, the beast gauge now acts as its own health bar; if a character's health gauge is depleted, they will automatically transform. The game features 18 playable fighters and a variety of game modes, including standard arcade, versus, time-attack, training, and survival modes. Of special mention is the career mode, in which fighting battles will earn so-called "DNA points," which can be spent on abilities and equipment to customize a character for use in other modes.</desc>

		<name>Bomberman Hardball</name>
		<desc>Bomberman Hardball is divided into four games. Battle mode (the standard Bomberman game), is joined by tennis, golf and baseball games. At the center of all this is the Living mode, a character building feature in which the player can design a Bomberman for use in any of the battle modes. 
 
Battle Mode is the centerpiece of this and all other Bomberman games. This mode is essentially the standard Bomberman formula; in the game, players navigate grid-based mazes, planting bombs in an attempt to hit other players (while avoided being hit by a bomb themselves). There are several different variations of Battle Mode, although they all center around the standard Bomberman gameplay. 
 
Classic Battle: A standard deathmatch-type game. 
Star Battle: Collect the most stars. 
Crown Battle: Find the crown in the level to win the game. 
Point Battle: Earn the most points by killing opponents 
Replay: Watched game sessions saved to memory card.</desc>

		<name>Breath of Fire : Dragon Quarter</name>
		<desc>Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter is a radical departure from the previous titles of the Breath of Fire series, and in some ways from standard Japanese-style role-playing games in general. The game is built like a huge dungeon crawler, with no overworld map. The combat is tactical: each character has action points (AP), which can be used to move around the screen during an enemy encounter, and perform a variety of combo attacks. There is no magic in the game, and many of the items found in dungeons are random. All the enemies are visible on screen. Depending on who first initiated a physical contact, the party or the enemies get an extra turn in battles. 
 
The game allows (and even encourages) the player to restart it from the beginning, keeping the items and the party experience. The game also features a special counter - Ryu can use his traditional dragon transformation abilities, but the counter raises with each such transformation, and when the counter reaches 100, the game is over. Raising the D-ratio allows characters to access new areas every time the game is replayed.</desc>

		<path>./Broken Sword - The Sleeping Dragon (Europe, Australia) (En,Es,It).gz</path>
		<name>Broken Sword : The Sleeping Dragon</name>
		<desc>Broken Sword - The Sleeping Dragon is an adventure game released on Windows, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 in 2003, while in Japan, the PlayStation 2 version (released only in Europe and Japan) was released in September 2004. A Nintendo GameCube version was planned, but was cancelled. It is the third instalment in the Broken Sword series, released six years after the previous instalment, The Smoking Mirror. The Sleeping Dragon moved the series to 3D graphics, and is the only game in the series not to use a point and click interface. The player assumes the role of George Stobbart, an American patent lawyer who flies to the Congo to write a patent for a scientist who claims to have found a source of unlimited energy. 
 The idea was first discussed in 2000. To make the game feel like a film, Revolution brought in a cinematic consultant, Bob Keen, who made sure the game conveyed emotions and atmosphere appropriate for each scene. The game was originally planned to have similar cartoon-quality visuals as its prequels, but the developers decided to aim at a style similar to Japanese animated films. Unlike the first two Broken Sword games, which used the Virtual Theatre engine, The Sleeping Dragon was built with the RenderWare engine. The game's music was composed by Ben McCullough, and Rolf Saxon returned to voice George Stobbart.</desc>

		<name>Brothers in Arms : Earned in Blood</name>
		<desc>The story is essentially told as a "reflection" on the events that took place earlier, as Army historian Colonel S.L.A. Marshall is interviewing paratroopers 15+ days after D-Day. The story is divided into three parts. The first part of the game is recollection of Hartsock's time in Sergeant Matt Baker's squad during the initial D-Day invasion. The second part picks up when he takes command of 2nd Squad, 3rd Platoon during the liberation and defense of Carentan, and the eventual link up between 82nd and 101st Airborne Division at the town of Baupte. The final part will take place in and around Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte. Although the first part takes place under Baker's command, every mission is one not included in Road to Hill 30. The player commands Desola, Allen, and Garnett from 3rd Squad, and some soldiers from 2nd Squad at first. Then the game switches the player to command the entire 2nd Squad after the Battle of Bloody Gulch (Hill 30). 
 
Hartsock's squad consists of the remains of the original 2nd Squad (Cpl. Franklin Paddock, Pvt. Dean "Friar" Winchell, and Pfc. James Marsh) and the remnants of 1st Squad (Cpl. Jacob Campbell, Pvt. Will Paige, and Pvt. Derrick McConnell). In addition, the player will also be in command of Corporal (later promoted to Sergeant) Seamus Doyle of the 82nd Airborne during the initial D-Day invasion in early parts of the game.</desc>

		<name>Bully</name>
		<desc>Bully is a subtle sandbox game set in a school environment. The player takes control of teenage rebel James "Jimmy" Hopkins, who from the opening cutscene is revealed to be a difficult student with a disruptive background. The game concerns the events that follow Jimmy being dropped off at Bullworth Academy, a fictional New England boarding school. The player is free to explore the school campus in the beginning and, later on in the game, the town, or to complete the main missions. The game makes extensive use of minigames. Some are used to earn money, others to improve Jimmy's abilities or get new items. 
 
School classes themselves are done in the form of minigames, broken into five levels of increasing difficulty. Each completed class brings a benefit to gameplay. English, as an example, is a word scramble minigame, and as Jimmy does well in this minigame, he learns various language-skills, such as the ability to apologize to police for small crimes. Chemistry also an example, is a button pushing minigame, and if Jimmy does well, he gains the ability to create firecrackers, stink bombs, and other items at his chemistry set in his room at the dorm.</desc>

		<desc>In Burnout Revenge, players compete in a range of racing game types with different aims. These take place within rush-hour traffic, and include circuit racing, Road Rage (where players cause as many rivals to crash as possible within a time limit, or until the player's car is wrecked), Burning Lap (a single-lap, single-racer time attack mode), Eliminator (a circuit race where every thirty seconds, the last-placed racer's car is detonated; the race continues until only one racer is left), and Crash (where the player is placed at a junction with the aim of accumulating as many "Crash Dollars" as possible). A new gameplay feature in Burnout Revenge is the ability to ram same-way small to medium traffic, known as "traffic checking", propelling the rammed car forward; the event in which a "checked" car hits a rival is considered as a Traffic Takedown. Traffic checking is the focus of a new race type, Traffic Attack (whereby a player must earn a set amount of Crash Dollars through checking traffic), which can be used later on.</desc>

After his betrothed, Sara, was kidnapped and taken to a large castle, Leon asked the Church for permission to command his underlings to attack the castle. Because of the Crusades going on in the East, he is denied such. But because of his love for Sara, he denounces his title and leaves, going with no weapon or clue to the castle. He is stopped by an alchemist named Rinaldo, who was once a vampire-hunter himself. He gives Leon the Whip of Alchemy, offers to help him further in his quest, and sends him on his way.</desc>

		<name>Circus Maximus : Chariot Wars</name>
		<desc>Circus Maximus is a racing game that takes place in ancient Rome, and as such you'll be racing chariots around various tracks, including the famed Colliseum. 
 
You'll be in control of both the driver and your partner, the warrior, whose job is to attack the other racers to make them fall over.  Chariots are controlled by whipping horses and trying to balance an on-screen meter that keeps your chariot balanced while taking turns fast. 
 
There are four different race modes available; Training, which gives you the basics on how to play, Arcade, which is your standard race, Multiplayer, which lets you face off against three friends (or foes), and Career, which tracks your progress over a period of time. 
 
There are seven different environments and 19 tracks, all set throughout the Roman Empire. 
 
Each course is littered with obstacles, power ups, weapons, and special moves, designed to give you an edge in combat.</desc>

In the distant future, a solar system called Theophilus is once again attacked by a mysterious alien race, called "the menace". The brave bounty hunter Sho, who wields a special sword which he can also use as a gun, is determined to put an end to the invasion. During his adventure he encounters a girl named Feanay, who will help him on his journey.

In this action game you control both Sho and Feanay. Some of the missions can be accessed by both characters, while some are available only to one of them. Feanay uses energy pistols and dual laser swords as weapons. Both Sho and Feanay use the so called "neo-psionics", which are the magic spells of the game. There are also slight role-playing elements in the game. Defeated enemies drop special items that can be later used to upgrade your weapons. You also gain set amounts of experience points after missions.</desc>

Dr. Kosugi, a scientist working for the A.R.M.A. corporation, has created three "mutanoids" - powerful bio-engineered fighters who regard him as their father. When they find out that Dr. Kosugi is missing, they venture into the dangerous areas of the city to bring him back and punish the culprits.

Crimson Tears is an action game with role-playing elements. Controlling either of the three protagonists (Amber, Kadie, or Tokio), each with their own strengths and weaknesses, the player explores randomly generated, enemy-infested stages, disposing of the foes in combo-based hack-and-slash combat. Experience points are gained from battle victories, allowing the characters to level up and become stronger.

Weapon components can be collected from fallen enemies and combined to make new weapons. Like the characters themselves, weapons level up, increasing in attack power and reducing the necessity to repair them. The protagonists have access to ranged attacks, blocks, and powerful area attacks. The player should also keep an eye on their temperature meter, preventing them from overheating.</desc>

		<name>Deus Ex : The Conspiracy</name>
		<desc>Deus Ex is a first-person shooter set in a dark, grim, near future. Gameplay is similar to the PC's Thief in that stealth is as important as racking up a body count. There is no multiplayer mode in the game -- just you against the computer. 
 Disease ravages the population while the duel for the much-in demand antidote Ambrosia rages on. Trying to keep order and make some sense of the situation is J.C. Denton, a cybernetically augmented agent of the United Nations Anti-Terrorist Coalition (UNATCO) who is up against National Secessionist Forces (NSF), re-packaged Triads and the shadowy underground known as Silhouette.</desc>

		<desc>Half Man. Half Demon. Pure Vengeance. Legends tell of two millennia ago, in the darkest reaches of Hell, a demon swordsman named Sparda awoke to justice and a rebelled against the devil to wage a one-man war to save the human world from damnation. Now, 2000 years later, a dark figure named Dante finds clues that the Devil is rallying to rise up again against mankind. Who was Sparda and how does Dante fit into this gothic puzzle? Deep within Dante's blood lies the power of ancient demons and the key to defeat the hordes of the dark realm. Somewhere between a man and a demon lies our only chance for salvation. If he succeeds, even the Devil May Cry.</desc>

		<name>Dirge of Cerberus : Final Fantasy VII</name>
		<desc>Set after the events of Final Fantasy VII and the Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children movie, Dirge of Cerberus lets players take the role of the mysterious Vincent Valentine. 
 
After a new organization arises from the events known as "Meteorfall", Vincent is called to the surviving town of Kalm by Reeve Tuesti, an old ally who controlled Cait Sith. Vincent has been invited to the town's celebration, but during the festivities, a group of soldiers attacks the town, killing and capturing the people. It is up to Vincent to protect the innocent once more, and find out why these soldiers are also after him. 
 
While set in the world of Final Fantasy VII, Dirge of Cerberus is an action shooter that runs through twelve chapters. The on-screen action can be controlled by the analog controller, or via the Playstation 2's mouse and keyboard accessories, making it more in line with PC-style shooters. Being a character driven shooter, the perspective can be changed from first to third person on the fly to navigate through the multi-level environments. 
 
Several items and characters from the series make their return, as well as the Chaos break limits system, which allows Vincent to take the monstrous forms he changed into from Final Fantasy VII to inflict more damage on the enemy. Taking a nod from its RPG-based parent, the game does allow Vincent to find the usual healing items, materia spells and gil from the Final Fantasy universe, in which he can buy and sell for other new items. 
 
The game also features a weapon customization system, which allows the player to mix and match weapon parts to form more powerful attack items and abilities.</desc>

		<name>Disgaea : Hour of Darkness</name>
		<desc>After a two-year sleep, Prince Laharl awakens to find his father, King Krichevskoy, dead and the Netherworld in the middle of a civil war over who takes the throne. Not willing to give up his rightful place as the next king, Laharl joins with his subordinate Etna and her underlings to fight back. 
 
Disgaea is a tactical role playing game. Battle gameplay takes place on a map divided into a square grid. The player controls a squad of humanoid units and monsters, which each occupy a single square of the grid and do combat with a group of enemies. Depending on the character and attack selected, the player will be able to deal damage to a specific enemy unit or a designated region of the map. Combat ends when all enemy units or all of the player's units are destroyed. 
 
Humanoid characters may lift and throw other units across the map in order to allow allies to move further or force enemies to keep their distance. This even allows the player to capture enemies by throwing them into the base panel; these enemies then become allies, and can be used on subsequent maps. The chance of capturing an enemy in this manner depends on several factors. Failure to capture the enemy will result in the death of all characters inside the base panel, and the enemy will survive.</desc>

Instead his daughter, Rozalin is summoned, and Adell commits to returning her home to her father, as well as to defeating her father when they find him.  
 
The game is a turn-based strategy RPG in the vein of Final Fantasy Tactics. Classes gain abilities by gaining character levels, and can level up those abilities through use. New items and equipment can be bought or won in battle, and can be powered up up by entering and winning battles inside a given item. Characters can also "gang up" on enemies by performing combos that are activated by positioning other characters near an attacking character. This action only uses the attacking character's turn, leaving the others free to attack again. Clever coordination can have characters attacking quite a few times per turn. New characters can be created (or even reborn as other classes or just more powerful versions of the same class) by petitioning (or even bribing with special items) the Dark Assembly with "Mana" you earn by defeating enemies.</desc>

First team to get the other team out is the winner, be it through the one-shot system or a "life system" where the object is to lower the opposition's players health to zero. If both teams are still in by the end of the game, the team with the most players wins the game. If teams have an equal amount of players left then the team with the least damage taken wins. If equal damage has been taken by either team then the game ends in a tie. 
 
Play as one of six teams who each represent a certain country, spearheaded by a figure from history or national folklore - Japan (Nobunaga), Germany (Bach), Greece (Pythagoras), Norway (King Harald I), Great Britain (King Arthur) and the United States of America (Wyatt Earp). There are three other teams to unlock as the game progresses. 
 
Either play through the single-player World Tournament to become Dodgeball World Champion, play against a friend in a Team Battle, or team up with up to three friends for a Multi-Player Battle against the computer.</desc>

Recharged with the fires of a Dragon, Caim's vengeance burns over the enemy... 
 
The player controls Caim on his quest. The game is separated into three distinct modes: Aerial combat, Ground combat and Event Combat. In Aerial Combat, Caim rides dragonback against a variety of airborne foes breathing fireballs (strong single shots and weaker multiple lock-on shots). The Dragon is agile and is able to evade incoming threats, turning around completely in a moment. In Ground combat, the game is shown in 3rd person though usually large, open areas. Controlling Caim, his primary ability is the use of a variety of weapons found on the battlefield. These are leveled up through continued usage, and specifically through the killing of individual enemies. Though magic (determined by weapon choice), timed attacks and evasion, Caim breaks through enemy armies. Characters recruited as allies by Caim can also be summoned during battles, steadily losing health until control is returned to Caim. In ground combat, Caim may also call forth his Dragon to ride and strafe enemies from the air. The Dragon's movements are generally the same as in aerial combat but more limited and less agile. Event combat is similar to Ground combat, but shown isometrically, restricted to a single weapon and without the aid of a dragon. It is used mainly to tell story sequences. 
 
Levels that have been visited before might become "Expedition Missions" which are optional and contain new objectives, enemies and weapons. Additionally, any level previously played in the storyline may be revisited at any time. Depending on Caim's choices (and prerequisites for those choices), there are five different endings to Drakengard.</desc>

		<name>Drakengard 2</name>
		<desc>This sequel to the Square-Enix action game continues the multifaceted air and ground combat of the original. Drakengard 2 (known as Drag On Dragoon in Japan) takes place 18 years after the events of the original. The whereabouts of the original's hero, Caim, are unknown to anyone. A new young knight called Nowe serves as the playable main character. Together with his dragon, Legna, Nowe takes part in land and air-based battles, just like in the original, albeit with more refined gameplay. The kill-all mechanics and upgradable weapons of the original return with this title, with the promise of faster action. While on the ground, the game now lets you change freely between characters, with no limit. You'll want to switch characters in order to best match the enemy at hand. Other additions include new mega attacks while airborne.</desc>

		<name>Mashed - Drive to Survive</name>
		<desc>Mashed is an action-packed top-down arcade-racer. On 13 tracks (which must be played free in single-player first) you need all your driving skills to survive and make it to the finish as the 1st with one of the four different cars available (from slow ones to really fast ones). 
 
The heart of the single-player mode (besides the quick battle against the AI) are the bronze, silver and gold challenges for every track you need to complete to play free the next track. Each challenge is one of the seven (eight in multiplayer) game modes available in Mashed. From normal race-events (just be the 1st) over battles where you need to kill all your enemies before they do to the ultimate survival mode where everyone doesn't really like you. 
 
To make things much easier there are nine different power-ups and weapons scattered on the tracks which you can pick up. From simple oil slicks over mines to deadly mortars there's everything you need to kick the enemy drivers out of the race. Of course they can also choose from the equipment. As you can only survive a few hits you need to make sure they can't use them on you. And to make it even worse there are many small passages (or the track is just one small passage...) with nothing on one or both sides of the track in which you or your enemy can fall very deep.</desc>

		<name>Driver : Parallel Lines</name>
		<desc>Driver: Parallel Lines is the fourth game in the Driver series, following the story of TK. In 1978, TK (who was then an 18-year-old driver-for-hire who had just graduated from high school) was sentenced to 28 years in prison for a crime he did not commit, and is released from prison in 2006. Now, with his driving skills, he seeks revenge against the police department for having to serve time for something someone else should've gone to prison for! 
 
Unlike Driv3r, Driver: Parallel Lines mostly takes place behind the wheel, returning back to the formula that made the first game a classic. The game still has a GTA-style open-ended design, though, and you can still exit your vehicle for some on-foot action. However, there's no reason to exit your vehicle unless it's damaged and you can no longer drive it, as almost all of the game's missions involve cop car chases. If that's the case, then you can either go to the repair shop to repair your vehicle, or just steal someone else's vehicle! Until then, you can punch the cops with your fists and steal their weapons when they're dead, so that you can use them for future on-foot combat.</desc>

The story takes two roads of two different heroes who run around fields killing monsters in real time action a bit like in Zelda games. The hook in this game, or not so much of a hook, but the thing that separates it from most of other RPG is that the characters don't level up. The power of character is measured by his equipment so when you get a better sword, you kinda level up that way. The weapons and equipment are also customizable so if you like playing with your tools, this is the game for you. This was the first RPG to appear on PS2 in Europe.</desc>

		<desc>On December 24, 2005, Sergeant Dennis Riley, member of the special U.S. Marine Team Red Light receives a distress call from Fort Stewart, a top secret research facility in Antarctica. The signal requests an immediate air strike on the base. The team is sent to investigate the matter, but their plane crashes in the tundra. When Dennis arrives at the facility he finds out that something horrible has occurred, and must fight for his life as he encounters mutated creatures and is in danger of getting infected himself. 
 
Extermination is a survival horror game. The player character has limited ammunition for his firearms and in many cases it is advisable to run away from monsters. Besides the traditional health bar Dennis also has an Infection Rate, which may gradually grow when attacked by monsters. Once his Infection Rate reaches 100% he becomes very weak and would eventually mutate into a monster. Infection can be countered by applying MTS vaccines.  
 
The player character's default weapon, a special purpose rifle, can be customized with enhancements such as zoom scope, flashlight grip, radar, and parts which convert it to other weapon types such as flame thrower, shotgun, or rocket launcher. Dennis can also fight with a knife. Throughout the game batteries must be collected and used for activating various machines and saving the game.</desc>

		<desc>This fireworks-based puzzle title is notable for being the only title available from Sony on the PlayStation 2's launch date. In a manner similar to Missile Command, the goal is to select and detonate matched groups of flares. Using the analog stick to point from flare to flare, a player must link three or more similar flares and set them off in a chain of fireworks explosions. The bigger the chain, the higher your score. 
 Each level has a predetermined length and a set course, scrolling through cities, outer space, and unknown territories. With a limited amount of energy, players stay alive by detonating as many flares as possible, and by grabbing various power-ups as they appear onscreen. Collecting enough "star" power-ups releases a "Starmine" flare -- a sort of bonus round, rapid-fire succession of flares. 
 Upon successfully completing a level, you can watch a replay using various camera angles and add different lighting and weather effects. You can also store your best rounds on a memory card and show your fireworks displays off to your friends. Skilled players will be able to unlock a few extra options once they complete the regular game, including a Master Chain mode.</desc>

Her brother, Mafuyu, and his mentor, Junsei Takamine, went to investigate a mansion that once was inhabited by a powerful landowner who had absolute control over the area. Unfortunately, they never returned from their investigation. Miku enters the mansion, armed with only an antique camera given to her by her deceased mother, to try to find her brother. 
 
While inside the mansion, Miku will encounter ghosts and other spiritual apparitions. In order to overcome these spirits and survive, she must use the magical camera to capture the ghosts on film, thereby trapping them forever. Ghosts range from invisible fragments hidden in scenery, to memories of the past that appear only for a moment before vanishing, to full body apparitions that will attempt to attack and kill Miku. 
 
In order to defeat an aggressive ghost the Camera Obscura's shot must first be "charged" by keeping the ghost centered while it is visible. If Miku snaps a shot while the ghost is attacking or is vulnerable then she will drain even more energy from it, resulting in more spirit points being earned. Points can then be spent to improve her camera's attributes or give it special abilities, like slowing a ghost or pushing it away. The Camera Obscura can also reveal clues and dispel illusions, which Miku will need to utilize to solve puzzles within the mansion.</desc>

The camera no longer has to charge up a shot, but different film types now have loading times that can leave leave Mio defenseless if she takes a picture at a bad time. Special abilities for the camera no longer require a disposable item, and are instead charged by taking good shots of attacking ghosts. The stats of the camera and special abilities are still upgraded/unlocked with spirit points, but an item must first be found and spent as well to upgrade each level of a stat. 
 
The Xbox release of Fatal Frame II includes an additional difficulty level, an additional ending, several extra unlockable cosmetic accessories, six additional unlockable pairs of costumes for Mio and Mayu, an unlockable survival mode with an additional ghost type, and an optional first person control/view style.</desc>

		<name>Fight Club</name>
		<desc>Fight Club is based on David Fincher's film adaption of Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name. Fed up with consumerist American culture, a fight club is founded as a new type of therapy through bare-knuckle fighting. The game focuses on the fights and uses many characters and environments from the original story. You can create a new fighter or clone one of the generated characters. There are three general fighting styles to choose from: grappling, kung fu or brawling. The moves range from basic punches to devastating moves with broken bones, ripped clothes and real-time facial deformation. After each successful fight, you earn Character Development Points (CDP's) which can be used to upgrade or heal your character. 
 
Aside from the regular arcade, survival and training mode, there is a story mode in which you need to work your way up as a rookie to become a key player in Project Mayhem in a storyline very loosely based on the original plot. Both the PS2 and Xbox version have an online multiplayer mode as well.</desc>

		<desc>Square's acclaimed role-playing series makes its PlayStation 2 debut with Final Fantasy X. Players assume the role of Tidus, an athletic teenager who witnessed the destruction of his home city by an evil entity named Sin. While his life was spared, Tidus' contact with Sin opened a portal through time. Some 1,000 years have passed since the encounter, and Tidus now finds himself in a strange land with unfamiliar faces. As Tidus struggles to find a way back home, he will meet a variety of characters, including Yuna, a girl faced with the daunting task of defeating Sin.   Final Fantasy X features a number of new features over previous installments. Backgrounds and characters are rendered entirely in 3D, with real-time facial expressions visible on each character. When characters are surprised, for example, they will raise their eyebrows or open their mouths in astonishment. For the first time in the series, dialogue has been recorded using professional voice actors. The U.S. version features voices in English, with optional English subtitles selectable from the menu screen.</desc>

		<desc>The game's story follows the character Yuna from Final Fantasy X as she seeks to resolve political conflicts in the fictional world of Spira before it leads to war. 
 
The story begins as Yuna, Rikku and Paine recover Yuna's stolen Garment Grid from the Leblanc Syndicate in the first of several encounters in which they vie for spheres. The game is punctuated by a narration of Yuna addressing Tidus, as though she is recounting the events of the game to him as they occur in a style reminiscent of Tidus' own narration in Final Fantasy X. Although Yuna's quest is to find clues that may lead her to Tidus, much of the storyline of the game follows the clash of the factions that have established themselves in the time since the coming of the Eternal Calm in Final Fantasy X, and the uncovering of hidden legacies from Spira's ancient history. A significant portion of the game's events are unnecessary for the completion of the main storyline, but much of the depth of the story?including characterization and background details?are featured in the optional content, which generally follows how each part of Spira is healing in the time since the passing of Sin.</desc>

After the end of a fight one evening, Kyle and Cody decide to meet at the local bar to celebrate with some beers and a round of pool; however, Cody has some unspoken business that delays his arrival for an hour. After Kyle arrives at the bar, he plays a game with his girlfriend and bar owner Vanessa Simms, while waiting for Cody. Kyle later finds out that Cody is using a powerful strength-enhancing drug called "glow", which helps the arthritis in his knees. Kyle later discovers that glow is being made by a psychotic priest named Father Bella, who hopes to use the drug to bring about the apocalypse. When Kyle finds Bella on the roof of his church, Cody is with him, mutated by a concentrated dose of glow. It is later revealed that Bella is actually the younger brother of Belger, the antagonist of the original game, just before he and Kyle begin to fight.</desc>

		<desc>Blending high-speed races and dynamic crashes along with a cinematic storyline, FlatOut comes to the PS2 with a number of features designed to set it apart from previous racing titles. Players can leave their car before entering a race to check out the competition at the pit areas, glean some information at the local bar, perform tune-ups, and embark on brief missions to further the story. The heart of the game is the racing competition, where players hit the pedal to the metal on a variety of outdoor venues. The environment is also interactive, to the point where cars can smash through wooden barriers, send piles of stacked tires bouncing along the road, and knock orange cones flying into the distance. A number of jumps are also available, to catch some air. 
 Real-time damage modeling is another highlight in FlatOut, with details such as engines, transmissions, and the driver viewable after smashing, crashing, and bashing into rival vehicles. Each part is designed to dent, crumple, crack, or fly off, and parts hurtling through the air can damage other vehicles as well.</desc>

Stealth plays an important role, as well as light and darkness, as the creatures are sensitive to it in different ways. Just like in the previous game, you can sight-jack enemies and animals, to view the environment through their eyes. There are over 30 weapons to collect and there are three difficulty options.</desc>

Following a plot of justice and vengeance, you take the role of the gifted Paul Atreides to lead the mystic Fremen tribes against the House of Harkonnen, which massacred his family and stole his birthright in its greedy quest for power. 
 As Paul Atreides, you must complete a series of missions to prove your worth to the Fremen, including evasion or killing of Harkonnen soldiers. Gameplay elements include stealth (knifing guards from the side or from behind) and overt methods using a variety of projectile weapons. Healing your character of damage requires water -- on the desert planet, water is life. As water is limited in natural form, surprising and killing an enemy soldier with a knife allows you to take a portion of his body's water for healing purposes.</desc>

		<name>Gauntlet : Seven Sorrows</name>
		<desc>Gauntlet is back for yet another iteration. The Emperor has crucified his four loyal heroes to a magic tree, driven by a maniac thirst for their immortality. Hundreds of years later, as only a ghost, he came to regret all the wrong deeds he has done and frees them, asking them to defeat his six former advisors in an attempt to undo what he has done. 
 
This version of Gauntlet goes back to the roots: The warrior, valkyrie, elf, and wizard fight their way through hordes of enemies to make their way to the six bosses. The game is mostly a hack'n'slash affair, puzzles are limited to finding keys and pressing buttons that open doors and portals. Every character has a unique set of moves and attacks: The warrior has rather powerful attacks, the valkyrie has quick moves, the elf can shoot powerful arrows, and the wizard has several magical range attacks. 
 
Defeating enemies gives you experience points that may be used to increase your three stats; some chests in the levels contain better armor or weapons. Also, new moves can be purchased with gold. 
 
The game can be played both in single-player as well as cooperative multi-player, where up to four players fight together. 
 
The newest feature of this game (other than the much better graphics) is the online gaming feature. Played online, the game is identical to a regular multiplayer game, with each player on a different box.</desc>

		<name>Genji : Dawn of the Samurai</name>
		<desc>Based loosely on the influential, 11th century romantic novel The Tale of Genji, Genji: Dawn of the Samurai is a combat-focused adventure set in a feudal Japan rife with magic and mystery. Players alternate between control of two lead characters: the young, lithe Yoshitsune, who wields twin samurai blades, and the grizzled, burly Benkei, who fights with an enormous club. Success in battle allows players to gradually upgrade their characters' skills. The game's story leads them on a journey of discovery and honor, through a foreign land where they are often met with distrust and aggression. 
 Acting as the historic hero Genkuro Yoshitsune or his trusted companion Benkei, the warrior monk, you set out on a mission to release the oppressed from the evil forces of the warlord Kiyomori and restore the Genji dynasty to power.</desc>

		<desc>Mark Hammond is an ex-gangster who wants to forget his past and live honestly with his wife and little son. Everything goes horribly wrong when London's most vicious criminal, the organized crime boss Charlie Jolson, decides that he needs Mark's services and obtains them in a twisted and cruel way: Mark's wife is murdered, he is framed for this murder, and his child gets kidnapped.  
 
Jolson makes it clear: unless Mark does what he orders him to do, the boy dies. Using the helpless man in his plan to bring down other criminal organizations of the city, Jolson sends Mark on suicidal missions during which Mark has three terrible choices: walk away and lose his son, get killed in a battle against overwhelming odds, or single-handedly help Jolson to get rid of his adversaries. 
 
Once the player completes Mark Hammond's story, a new scenario opens, in which the player controls Frank Carter, a vigilante cop who won't stop until he brings Charlie Jolson to justice. Frank's scenario is parallel to Mark's, shedding more light on events that remain somewhat unexplained during Mark's scenario.</desc>

Set in a run-down, supernaturally afflicted Detroit, Ghost Hunter begins in earnest soon after Lazarus and his partner unwittingly disturb an otherworldly experiment and unleash forces of the beyond. 
 One of these freed entities bonds with the hero, gifting him with a number of special powers and abilities. Unfortunately, Lazarus' partner Anna Steele does not fair so well. She is, quite literally, spirited away. Players lead the game's hero on a brooding, spooky quest to save her, and the rest of the world as well, from the dangerous ghosts they accidentally set free. 
 STORY: 
 Few people have the ability to see ghosts, and few spirits are able to communicate with the outside world, but the earth is nonetheless full of supernatural forces the remnants of every creature killed before its time. Some degenerate into monstrous creatures, others exist for centuries increasing in power and retaining a human mind. A number of these creatures have formed 'The Parliament of Spooks' and their sole aim is to steal back life from the living.</desc>

		<desc>Giga Wing Generations is a vertically scrolling shooter and the third game in the Giga Wing series. Players control one of four available ships over the constantly scrolling landscapes and need to earn a high score (and survive!) by shooting the various enemies that appear and dodging numerous bullets and obstacles. The game is a "bullet hell" style shooter and there are a significant number of bullets to dodge, sometimes hundreds at a time covering the entire screen. Each of the available ships has three types of attacks. The first is the basic attack. Next is the reflect force; this acts as a temporary shield and any bullets that are encountered are gathered and then fired back at the enemy. The final attack is a bomb and is the most powerful attack affecting everything on the screen. The four ships each have different attack abilities and flight characteristics. As is typical in arcade style shooters, weapon upgrades can be acquired to increase your firepower.</desc>

		<desc>God of War is an action-oriented adventure game with a strong focus on fast-paced combat. Players take control of Kratos, a mystically powerful hero in the ancient Greece of classic mythology. Kratos can perform super-human leaps, agile dodges, and magically enhanced combo attacks, which all flow together in a stream of intense engagement. The fast-paced, over-the-top fighting, combined with the tense environments and computer-directed camera angles, give gameplay the feel of combat-adventures such as Devil May Cry or Otogi.   Unlike those earlier blends of survival-horror presentation and combat-minded control schemes, however, God of War is set in a world more immediately familiar to all fans of western fantasy. The ultimate goal of Kratos is a conclusive confrontation with Ares -- the god of war himself -- but the hero must face a deadly succession of monsters and villains from Greek mythology as he pursues this end. The Hydra, Medusa, the Cyclops, the Minotaur, and other legendary creatures will all have their chances to destroy Kratos before he meets his final destiny.</desc>

Players now accumulate points by winning races in the normal first-person driving mode, called A-Spec mode. Each race event can yield up to a maximum of 200 A-Spec points. Generally, a win using a car with less of an advantage over the AI opponents is worth more points. Points can only be won once, so to win further points from a previously-won event, it must be re-won using a car with less of an advantage over the AI. There are also the 34 Missions which can yield 250 points each. Despite this, A-Spec points are experience points, not money.</desc>

		<desc>The player takes on the role of Tommy Vercetti, a man who was released from prison in 1986 after serving 15 years for killing eleven people. The leader of the organization for whom he used to work, Sonny Forelli, fears that Tommy's presence in Liberty City will heighten tensions and bring unwanted attention upon his organization's criminal activities. To prevent this, Sonny ostensibly "promotes" Tommy and sends him to Vice City to act as their buyer for a series of cocaine deals.[7] During Tommy's first meeting with the drug dealers, an ambush by an unknown party results in the death of Tommy's bodyguards, Harry and Lee, and the cocaine dealer. There is another survivor, the pilot of the dealer's helicopter, who flies off and escapes. Tommy narrowly escapes with his life, but he loses both the Forelli's money and the cocaine.</desc>

		<desc>Vice City Stories is a prequel to Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2 years earlier) and it is the sequel to Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories. Set in 1984, players take on the role of Vic Vance, an army soldier who loves his country, family, and himself. One bad decision turns everything around and he is kicked onto the streets of a tough city. He has to build an empire to survive, or be left to die. Together with his brother Lance, a drug addict, the siblings try to take over Vice City. 
 
Just like other GTA titles, gameplay consists of third-person shooting and driving sequences in an open environment. You will meet new enemies and gangs, and old foes. The missions require you to kill with a selection of weapons, steal vehicles such as a car, a boat, or a plane, rob to make it big, or just to have fun.</desc>

Grandia Xtreme is the first Grandia game to be originally released for Playstation 2. Its combat system is virtually the same as in the previous two games, a mixture of strategic planning and combo attacks. Your party members can run around, avoid enemy attacks, and their attack power depends on their distance from the enemies. Grandia Xtreme is heavily based on combat, with more dungeons, more fighting, and less story than the two previous installments of the series.</desc>

Juji fights using a unique combination of close-range guns and swordplay, while Billy defeats his enemies with the sheer power of his electric guitar. 
 
Gungrave: Overdose features character designs by Yasuhiro Nightow (creator of the anime/manga Trigun) and Kosuke Fujishima (known for his work on Sakura Wars, Ah My Goddess, and the Tales series), and soundtrack composition by Tsuneo Imahori (composer for Trigun, Hajime no Ippo and the Gungrave anime series).

It is meant to be played with two players at the same time as it is more puzzle-oriented than the original game and the first two expansions. Singleplayer is also possible, but then switching between the two characters is necessary to advance. When not active, the other character is AI controlled for basic actions.</desc>

		<desc>Harvest Moon: Save the Homeland marks a significant shift in focus for the series, becoming more of a "life simulation" than the "farm simulation" it once was. Unlike previous incarnations where the main objective was to resurrect a dying farm and ultimately turn a profit, this PS2 title presents players with a slightly more desperate predicament: The land upon which the village is built has been earmarked for the development of a new resort complex. Construction begins in exactly one year and in that time you'll have to find a way to save the village. Incidentally, there are nine different ways that this can be achieved, providing nine different game endings. 
 Harvest Moon: Save the Homeland is also the first title in the series to make use of 3D environments, and has included a user-definable camera that can be manipulated as needed with the aid of the right analog stick. The game also makes use of "cel-shading" -- a technique that has become synonymous with cartoon-style games.</desc>

At times players will need to defend outposts against incoming attacks using a gun turret or fight enemies one-on-one in arena combat. The action is driven by a cinematic storyline that sheds new light on the world Haven is trying so desperately to save. 
 
 
 The King Athellion has left his homeworld to fight in an intergalactic crusade. He left behind a huge bell - The Golden Voice - for his people to call him should they ever be in danger. During his absence however, the evil Lord Vetch invades the planet and enslaves Athellion's people by infecting them with a deadly virus. A virus, that requires a constant treatment with an antidote called catana. As the only one controlling the catana-support, Lord Vetch was easily able to force everyone to work for him. In order to prevent Athelion's return he has hidden The Golden Voice and soon it was forgotten along with the king's promise. Forgotten until Haven, one of the slaves, starts having dreams about a hill and a bell; dreams whose meaning he does not understand. When the news of the Haven's dreams reach Lord Vetch, he orders to murder him. Haven manages to escape and eventually learns about the real meaning of his dreams and is determined to find The Golden Voice and put an end to Lord Vetch' reign.</desc>

		<desc>Enter a dark future where bounty hunters rule the streets and human organs are the preferred currency. Take the role of Jack Wade, a man whose memory has been stolen. Follow a story of violence and mystery in a quest to bring heartless killers to justice. The action takes place from both first- and third-person perspectives, in 3D locations ranging from seedy biker bars to futuristic laboratories. Headhunter is one of two Dreamcast games ported to the PS2 by Acclaim in 2002. Along with Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future, this title has been optimized in its move to the Sony console. 
 Welcome to the future. In the early 21st century, gang warfare and crime have lead to the creation of privatised law enforcement. The Anti-Crime Network (ACN) employs bounty hunters known as ?Headhunters? to track down the most wanted criminals, using combat skills and high-tech weaponry.</desc>

		<name>Headhunter : Redemption</name>
		<desc>As bounty hunters in a disturbing future, players must sneak by, strong-arm, and shoot down those who would flee from justice. This action-adventure is built upon the story and gameplay of the original Headhunter (also developed by Amuze), released in 2001 for European Dreamcasts and ported to North American PS2s the following year. Unlike the original, however, Headhunter: Redemption offers two main characters and two different, urban game worlds for them to patrol and protect. 
 
 Played primarily from a third-person perspective, Redemption has players taking the role of either headhunter veteran Jack Wade or his new associate, a punky street kid called Leeza X. Acting as a force for order, the two will travel to the city's wealthy, well-lit "Above," as well as its dark and downtrodden "Below," to enforce a justice once common to both of these two, disparate places.</desc>

		<name>Heroes of Might and Magic : Quest for the DragonBone Staff</name>
		<desc>Heroes of Might and Magic: Quest for the DragonBone Staff is really the old classic King's Bounty from New World Computing for the PC with revamped graphics. Very little else has changed, in fact even the text was the exact same with the original. 
 
 For those who are not familiar with the history of the series, King's Bounty was a spin-off of the Might &amp; Magic RPG series which was then still in its early chapters and was inspired by board games. The gameplay resembles a simplified Heroes of Might &amp; Magic game with only one Hero and no city improvements. Combat is turn-based using a set grid and stacked units. 
 
 The goal of the game is to discover an ancient artifact by collecting pieces of a map and identifying its location before time runs out. Of course the player must have amassed a strong army by then because he will have to face the evil Dragon overlord before the end.</desc>

Sticking to the series' successful mix of approachable interface and realistic action, the game offers players numerous perspectives of each lie and shots are made through button taps, timed to a fluctuating bar that determines power and accuracy.   Hot Shots Golf Fore! offers a dozen courses (some of which were featured in Hot Shots Golf 3), and an even greater selection of characters to play through them. As in earlier games, certain characters are available from the start and players will need to unlock the others, but all can be customized with different clothing and equipment. A number of caricatured caddies are also available, to offer support and advice (sometimes, whether it's wanted or not).   A favorite feature from the PlayStation's original Hot Shots Golf returns in this version: the ability to play 18 holes of carom-friendly miniature golf. Hot Shots Golf Fore! is also the first in the series to offer online play. PlayStation 2 gamers with the PS2 Network Adaptor can log in to join other virtual golfers from all over the country. The online mode supports text chat, allowing two players to talk back and forth in real-time via keyboard.</desc>

		<name>Indigo Prophecy</name>
		<desc>Indigo Prophecy (Fahrenheit in Europe) is a psychological thriller in which the player is able to control different characters on both sides of a murder - the killer and those who are trying to find him. The game's core gameplay style is adventure. The three protagonists explore various locations, talk to other characters, and interact with the environment in order to advance. However, the game is heavy on various action-oriented sequences, from tasks that must be completed within a limited amount of time to quick time events, which require the player to press the correct button during a scene. 
 
The game emphasizes realism in the player's interaction with the environment. For example, picking up a rag and cleaning the floor requires the player to move the mouse or the analog stick back and forth, imitating the actual movements of the object. Dialogue with character often imposes time limits on the player; failure to choose the optimal response in time will prompt the game to choose another, not always the optimal one. The player's choice will sometimes influence the subsequent events and the outcome of the entire story, eventually leading it to one of the three possible endings.</desc>

 One-on-one, one-on-two, and two-on-two m?l?e matches are supported.

		<name>Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy</name>
		<desc>The creators of the beloved Crash Bandicoot series bring out a new duo of heroes for 3D platforming on the PS2 with this release of Naughty Dog's Jak and Daxter. While Jak is a handsome young hero with big blue eyes and bushy blond hair, his companion Daxter has been transformed into a small weasel-like creature by a strange dark curse. The two heroes set out to seek the forgotten secrets of the Precursors, an ancient race that inhabited the land many ages ago. Only by seeking the wisdom of the ancients can they hope to change Daxter back to his natural form. 
 
 The game is designed to provide a large 3D world populated with towns, ruins, and diverse wilderness areas and it does not follow any strict level progression. The storyline is open-ended enough to allow Jak and Daxter to find their own way through the adventure, searching the land, accepting quests, and taking on powerful boss characters in the order the player chooses. By helping local inhabitants Jak and Daxter can earn power cells, which help to open up new areas. The heroes also find new weapons and gain new spell as they journey through the land.</desc>

		<desc>Developer Naughty Dog takes the popular Jak and Daxter franchise in a new direction, as players will test Jak's lead foot in Jak X: Combat Racing. Summoned to Kras City to hear the reading of Krew's will, the duo find that they have been thrust into a deadly plot where everyone present at the reading has been unknowingly poisoned. In order for the antidote to be administered in time, Jak and Daxter must race in the Kras City Grand Championship. 
 Featuring over a dozen customizable vehicles designed with unique handling characteristics, players will race their "whip" through 20 tracks in eight different terrain arenas. With an assortment of power-ups available, including projectile weapons, mines, ranged weapons, turbo boosts, shields, and smart bombs, players should have the means necessary to ensure they're the first (and last) to cross the finish line.</desc>

Of course, that may be easier said than done when the "attractions" include velociraptors, tyrannosaurs, and other fearsome creatures.

		<desc>Swedish developer Avalanche Studios' first in-house development project is a 3D action-adventure starring a U.S. operative named Rico Rodriguez. Just Cause has Rodriguez attempting to overthrow a fictitious South American island's regime by instigating a revolution. Players will accomplish this by working with citizens, political factions, rebels, and even drug cartels in a series of explosive operations. 
 In the tradition of games like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Just Cause features a free form world with an estimated 250,000 acres of territory to traverse by plane, car, boat, or in some cases, parachute. Since the island of San Esperito is filled with cities, towns, resorts, jungles, and mountains, players can acquire more than 100 vehicles throughout their tumultuous stay. The main storyline includes over 20 missions with objectives that can be accomplished by any number of means. Hundreds of side and bonus missions are also available for fun or profit, with stunt challenges like parasailing, vehicle leaping, or skydiving part of the itinerary for tropical thrill-seekers.</desc>

		<name>Katamari Damacy</name>
		<desc>The King of All Cosmos accidentally destroyed the stars andâ€”having recoveredâ€”wants the prince to rebuild them. Unfortunately the prince stands a little less than half a foot tall, so recreating the stars will require some effort. Enter the Katamari, a sphere the prince can push around our world to â€œroll upâ€  items increasing the Katamariâ€™s size until itâ€™s suitable for the King.    Taking place in stylized versions of Japanese houses, cities, and environs, the prince pushes the Katamari around collecting items which adhere to it. At first, the prince can only pick up smaller items, but as the Katamari grows, the more it can collect. Push pins and paper clips cling to the Katamari increasing its size so it can roll over obstacles and pick up bigger items. Over many levels, the Katamari can eventually pick up people, cars, and other bigger items.    Players steer the Katamari from a third-person perspective using the analog sticks on the PS2. A tutorial stage takes the player through the controls and sets up the story as well as introducing a side story about a Japanese girl who can feel the cosmos. Wanting to challenge the prince, the King sets requirements on the Katamariâ€™s size and sets time limits on the level. Bonus missions restore constellations and have their own restrictions.     The world of Katamari Damacy is brought to life with off-beat animation and a catchy soundtrack. Players can find presents hidden in the levels that contain accessories for the prince. Two players can also battle head-to-head in a Katamari competition.</desc>

 While the predecessors focused on the same style of swordplay, the victor of the battles was unclear until the very end. The addition of life-bars specifically steers this title more towards arcade than simulation.

 Kessen is the story of two warring clans waging war against each other for control of the entire land, during 15th and 16th century Japan. Tokugawa Ieyasu is a very strong and powerful leader and is tired of seeing the country ruled by his archenemy, Toyotomi Hideyoshi.</desc>

		<name>Kessen II</name>
		<desc>It is a time of war. Many leaders from different factions fight to control their land. One such leader, Liu Bei, has only one wish: peace. But war stands in his way, after his land Shu is attacked by the kingdom of Wei, led by the warlord Cao Cao, who abducts Liu Bei's beloved Diao Chan, the keeper of the Imperial Seal. Liu Bei has to flee, but swears to return, exact revenge on Cao Cao, and liberate the kingdom of Shu. 
 
Kessen II is a real-time strategy game, and a follow-up to Kessen. Unlike the first game, it is set in the Chinese Three Kingdoms period. The account of historical events is heavily fictionalized in the game, liberally adding new sub-plots (such as the entire romance angle of the story) and supernatural elements. The player can choose to command the armies of either Liu Bei or Cao Cao in their respective scenarios. 
 
The gameplay is similar to that of the previous game, the most notable change being the shift to supernatural warfare, including the addition of magical attacks such as tornadoes, lightning strikes, earthquakes, meteor showers, etc.  The player can now control 500 units at one time, as opposed to 100 in the previous game. New unit types (elite horsemen, elephant cavalry, etc.) have been added.</desc>

Following the prequels, this game comes with lots of cinematics and stays true to strategic as well as action gameplay, adding a few new things along the road, like collecting items during battles. 
 
The two main aspects of this game are planning and engaging in battle. Select officers and strategically place them on the field of battle, assign commands and issue orders. When on the battlefield, each of the officers, including Nobunaga, will have his/her army at their disposal which can be controlled at any point.

After the controversial resurgence of the Orochi power in the 2003 King of Fighters tournament, the tournament and the fighters return after a two year break in the action. Some are motivated to investigate the new Orochi situation and the antagonistic fighter Ash Crimson, while others enter the tourney to settle old scores... 
 
The King of Fighters XI features a roster of 33 "team" characters, 7 PS2 exclusive characters, 5 mid-boss characters and 2 boss characters. In total, this allows a player to choose between +40 characters. Many of the characters are returning fighters from the other games in the KOF series, though notable new faces exist in the effective forms of Oswald, Duck King, Bonne Jenet, Elisabeth Blanctorche and Gai Tendo.</desc>

		<desc>Aimed at grown-up gamers who aren't easily spooked (but who like to be), Kuon is a horror adventure set in Japan toward the end of the Heian period (approximately 800 C.E. to 1200 C.E.). A castle in the capital of Kyoto is overrun with unholy zombie-like beings. Gamers can play as an exorcist named Doman, who goes to explore the strange happenings at the castle, or as Doman's daughter, Utuski, who enters the castle to look for her father. Completing the game with both characters opens up an additional, final chapter in the story, through which gamers play as a third, unlockable character. 
 The whole game revolves around the strange events at a medieval Japanese manor and the nearby shrine. Yin Phase revolves around a sheltered girl named Utsuki. Her father is a civilian exorcist who has been summoned to investigate the manor. When he does not return, she and her sister travel to the manor in search of him. At the manor, eerie hymns put her sister into a trance, and she vanishes into the gloom. Utsuki must now find both her father and her sister.</desc>

		<desc>The game begins by retelling the final battle with Kain in the original Soul Reaver: Raziel confronts Kain in the Chronoplast time machine, and the two enter a portal through time to emerge thirty years before the events of Blood Omen. Moebius the Timestreamer tells Raziel that Kain is at the Pillars of Nosgoth, and Raziel goes and confronts him. Kain reveals he has plans to transform history to avert the consequences of his decision, when his past self refused to sacrifice himself to restore Nosgoth and doomed the land to eternal decay. Kain vanishes, and Raziel continues northward and finds the vampire Vorador, who hints at a profound secret that the deceased vampire Janos Audron once knew. Deciding to speak with Janos, Raziel returns to the Sarafan stronghold where he again meets Kain, who tells Raziel the Soul Reaver is the only way history can be changed, as he did so when battling William the Just with a future incarnation of the Reaver in Blood Omen. Kain hands Raziel the material Soul Reaver, and the spectral Soul Reaver Raziel has coils around it. Raziel is faced with a dilemma: kill Kain and submit to fate, or establish his free will by refusing. Raziel avoids dealing the death blow, changing time again before Kain vanishes. Raziel finds Moebius in his timestreaming chamber and forces him to send him to the past before the vampire purge of the Sarafan Order, but Moebius tricks him.</desc>

		<desc>Manhunt is a third-person stealth horror game. The game consists of twenty levels, and four bonus levels that can be unlocked; the levels are referred to as "scenes". Players survive the Scenes by dispatching enemy gang members known as "Hunters", occasionally with firearms but primarily by stealthily executing them in gruesome, over-the-top ways. 
 
The player is rated at the end of each level, primarily dependent on the gruesomeness of the killings and the speed of completion, from one (unimpressive) to five (extremely competent) stars. Executions are preferred in order to gain a higher score, thus encouraging players to play as viscerally as possible. The game's locales are full of "dark spots" and shadows where the player can hide while being chased by the Hunters; hiding in these dark areas makes the player invisible to opponents.</desc>

In the oppressed city of New Radius, you need to establish your name as an artist by laying down tags, burners and full pieces, but rival crews and law enforcement (Civil Conduct Keepers) are always on your tail. You will also uncover a conspiracy that plagues the city. 
 The game is story-driven with linear level progression. Most missions have platform elements and require you to lay art, varying from tags and stickers to complex pieces with full color, lettering and characters, on often difficult to reach surfaces. As it is not a friendly environment, Trane can deliver a host of punch and kick combos, use grabs, humiliate other artists, and interact with the surroundings. Your art arsenal includes markers, brushes, cans and rollers. All available pieces are kept in your black book, and new styles are unlocked while playing.</desc>

		<name>Maximo vs Army of Zin</name>
		<desc>The sequel to Maximo: From Ghosts to Glory, which was loosely based on the classic Ghosts 'n Goblins series, Maximo vs Army of Zin puts players in the role of Maximo, a master swordsman with a penchant for battling undead creatures. The action picks up where Ghosts to Glory left off, as the title hero must abandon his kingdom in order to search for his missing girlfriend. The developers at Capcom promise a more engrossing story this time around and have removed the hub screen, meaning each level flows into the next. There are 26 levels in all spread across six different environments. 
 As in earlier games in the series, Maximo wears boxer shorts beneath his armor. However, the underwear in this game actually serves a functional purpose beyond comic relief.</desc>

The game features several tricky puzzles in addition to many alien bad guys in need of fragging. 
 While MDK2: Armageddon is also a sequel to the successfully quirky original MDK, it is not a direct port of the Dreamcast or PC sequel versions of MDK2 released earlier the same year.

		<name>Mega Man X7</name>
		<desc>The plot of Mega Man X7 takes place in the 22nd century during an age when humans coexist with humanoid robots called "Reploids". As some Reploids participate in violent and destructive crime, a police organization called the "Maverick Hunters" was established to stamp out this activity. As the Reploid conflicts proceed after the Nightmare phenomena event of Mega Man X6, the world is slowly recovering. But as always, Maverick crime is rising in newly constructed cities. As this new crime wave hits, X finds himself trying to answer moral questions that have plagued him since he joined the Maverick Hunters: "Are we doing the right thing to solve this matter?", leading him to the decision of "I've had enough of this violence." Unable to assuage his conscience, he drops from the battle frontlines and assumes a more strategic support role at headquarters. With X's retirement, a massive power vacuum ensues and many independent groups develop, trying to fill the void left by the hunter. Prominent among these groups is the "Red Alert Syndicate", growing large enough to become a dominant force. The Red Alert is a new group of Reploids, similar to the Repliforce, but consisting of vigilantes. They claim to hunt Mavericks, but apparently do more than that. One of their members, Axl, decides he's had enough of their "murdering" and tries to leave the group. Red, the group's leader, is angered by Axl deserting, and goes on a rampage to get Axl back.</desc>

		<desc>Like its immediate predecessor, Megaman X8 presents its 2D-style platform-shooter action in a 3D game world. Mega Man X is joined in this adventure by two close associates, Zero and Axle, and each character has different strengths and abilities. Players can switch between two characters in the heat of battle, to solve a platform puzzle or fend of a particular enemy type, and the two characters not controlled by the player will try to help out in combat if the leading character becomes overwhelmed. 
 Characters not controlled by the player recover more quickly when the hero onscreen is performing well. As in most games in the long-running Mega Man series, defeating a boss character earns the ability to use its special weapon. Other defeated enemies may leave behind metal bits, which can be collected and used to create custom power-ups. In addition to the side-scrolling platform levels, some boss fights and other events are played from alternate perspectives.</desc>

This version also contains modifications and enhancements to the original Melty Blood, including characters and changes introduced in Melty Blood: Re-ACT, as well as the tweaks made for the arcade version. In fact, this release combines elements of two separate arcade releases, Ver. A and Ver. B of Act Cadenza. Move sets for several characters have been slightly changed or completely re-vamped, and a few new characters (including a hidden one) are introduced.</desc>

		<name>Metal Gear Solid 3 : Snake Eater</name>
		<desc>Hideo Kojima's critically acclaimed "tactical espionage action" series returns to PlayStation 2 in the anticipated follow-up to 2001's Sons of Liberty. Instead of slinking around futuristic installations, knocking on metal to distract guards, or crawling underneath a cardboard box, players are given a whole new Snake to wrangle. Drawing its inspiration from films like First Blood and Rambo: First Blood Part II, Snake Eater drops players in the middle of a thick jungle teeming with wildlife and, of course, terrorists.   Heavily armed enemies dressed in camouflage gear will patrol the dense forests, waterfalls, and surrounding areas, so players will be able to climb trees, fire pistols while hanging down from branches, and crawl through hollowed out logs to stalk their prey. Along the way, Snake will have to find sustenance by catching fish or other wildlife, while being mindful of natural hazards such hornets nests, cliffs, and rapids. Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater was first revealed in a 12-minute preview displayed at 2003's E3 in Los Angeles, California.</desc>

In some stages, the player can choose freely to play as Crockett or Tubbs, switching between them by the click of a button. They have different abilities (Tubbs, for instance, is tougher and can kick in doors, Crockett is more agile), and different weapons (Crockett has a pistol as primary weapon, Tubbs has a double barreled shotgun). The characters can also carry a secondary weapon, from among 14 types (9mm pistols, .45 pistols, silenced 9mm, Uzi-like sub-machineguns, etc.). Each character can use only certain types of weapon, Tubbs carrying usually the heavier ones. The primary weapons have unlimited ammo, the secondary ones don't.</desc>

		<name>Monster Rancher 3</name>
		<desc>Monster raising and creature contests move into the 128-bit generation as the popular Tecmo series sets up shop on the PlayStation 2 in this release of Monster Rancher 3. Though many characters and places are recognizable from earlier releases in the series, monsters in this game are represented in a cel-shaded cartoon style, similar to that of the Dreamcast's Jet Grind Radio or the contemporary PS2 release Yanya Caballista featuring Gawoo. 
  
 
As the game receives improved graphics and some additional features with its move to the more powerful console, many of the rules of play and monster-raising conventions established in earlier games remain in this version. Monsters develop according to the training and treatment they receive and players are encouraged to explore the game world to find new training opportunities. Players can generate monsters using other forms of media, as the game creates creatures according to data on music CDs and movie DVDs. While some aspects of creation are random, certain albums and movies may generate creatures specifically related to the artistic content on the disk.</desc>

		<desc>Raise monsters to explore and battle in this PS2 monster raising sim from Tecmo. This game improves upon previous installments by allowing more than one monster to be raised at once, interaction with the main character and the monsters, improved explorations, a customizable ranch, tag-team battles, improved 2P mode, a re-vamped battle system, and more detailed monsters. This game also features the longest most involved storyline of any Monster Rancher game to date. 
 
Your goal is to raise monsters to win in-game tournaments, explore for items, and improve your ranch. You can also test your raising skills by battling your monsters against a friend in 2P mode. 
 
The game still uses the innovative system of having a player insert music CDs, game discs, or DVDs into the PS2 to be read and used in making monsters. If you have a good sized collection of music, games, or movies, you can have access to a large variety of monsters very fast.</desc>

Mortal Kombat: Armageddon is thus a hostile homage to its frenzied fans, a love letter of sorts that tears away the heart-tugging sentiment for the still-beating heart. Armageddon offers the most significant throng of Mortal Kombat fighters thus far, with a roster spanning 62 combatants -- every minor and major character that has appeared in the series to date.

		<path>./Okage - Shadow King (USA).gz</path>
		<name>Okage : Shadow King</name>
		<desc>Okage: Shadow King is an RPG with a slight twist: it's humorous. 
 
The game's premise is that a boy (nameable by the player with the default name of Ari) makes a deal with an evil spirit to cure his sister of a curse that's caused her to speak entirely in pig Latin. The spirit, Evil King Stanley Hihat Trinidad XIV (or Stan for short), assumes the role of your shadow and orders you to track down the lost remnants of his power, which have been siphoned away by impostor Evil Kings over the last few thousand years while he was trapped in a bottle. And, while you're at it, Stan would also like you to help him take over the world. 
 
The game plays similarly to most JRPGs. Ari will visit towns and fight (turn based) battles against monsters - which in this game happen to be things like wild cows and man eating onions. Party members level up and gain new skills as they gain experience. Ari can respond to the story and other characters with a number of different dialogue options, such as a nice response, a rude response, or a silly response, and how he acts will affect how different party members feel about him.</desc>

Shiranui and Nagi are unable to defeat Orochi, but manage to seal the demon away.   In the game's present, Susano, a descendant of Nagi and self-proclaimed greatest warrior, breaks Orochi's seal due to the fact that he does not believe in the legend and wants to prove it false; Orochi escapes and curses the lands, sapping the life from every living being. Sakuya, the wood sprite and guardian of Kamiki Village, calls forth Amaterasu, the sun goddess, known to the villagers as the reincarnation of the white wolf Shiranui, and pleads for her to remove the curse that covers the land. Accompanied by the artist Issun (an inch-high creature known as a Poncle), Amaterasu is able to restore the land to its former beauty.</desc>

		<desc>Onimusha: Warlords is set in 16th century Japan during the period of the civil war dominated by Nobunaga Oda. You play Samanosuke Akechi, who dies during an attempt to stop the kidnapping of young princess Yuki, the sister to Yoshitatsu Saito. However, Akechi is given another chance at life, and is handed the gauntlet of the Ogres.  
 
With this new power Samanosuke must fight through the monster-filled halls of Inabayama Castle. As monsters are defeated, their souls are absorbed by the gauntlet, increasing its power. Some souls restore Samanosuke's health and magic, while others can be used to power up weapons, armor, and items. Powering up weapons will increase their damage and the strength of their associated magic, and is also required to pass by special locks throughout the castle. Items will need to be found in one part of the castle to unlock doors or otherwise bypass obstacles elsewhere in the castle, and sometimes the player will take control of Samanosuke's companion Kaede while Samanosuke is incapacitated in some way. Kaede can reach some locations that are beyond Samanosuke as well as pick locks and throw kunai, but she can not absorb souls or open any lock intended for the wearer of the Ogre gauntlet.</desc>

Ten years after Samanosuke Akechi battled a resurrected demon lord in Onimusha, Nobunaga has returned to terrify and oppress innocents across the country. Fortunately a young samurai, Jubei Yagyu, has noticed the spread of evil and resolved to battle the demonic forces wherever he finds them. 
 The famous Japanese actor Yusaku Matsuda, best known in the U.S. for the 1989 movie Black Rain, was the model for Jubei Yagyu. Matsuda died in 1989 of cancer, but returns for a starring role in Onimusha 2. Capcom also hired Keita Amamiya as character designer, director, and illustrator to insure a high-quality product. Onimusha 2 includes twice as many cut-scenes as the original, and the quality of these cut-scenes has been dramatically improved. Action stars were hired to add additional realism.</desc>

Working closely with Williams to ensure authenticity of each of the games, the collection is highlighted by some of the most popular and innovative Williams pinball tables, including Gorgar, the first-ever talking pinball machine, Black Knight, which introduced "Magna-Save" and Bonus Ball, and Space Shuttle, which took the pinball industry by storm in 1984. Every table has been meticulously recreated to bring players the visuals, sound effects and gameplay that made these games legendary successes. Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection harkens back to the arcades of the 1980s. Players begin Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection with access to four pinball tables, and the remaining four tables are unlocked as the game progresses. Players can spend as little as two minutes on a quick pinball challenge, or delve deeper into the game, gaining rewards in a token-based system as they unlock each of the pinball tables. Single-player Arcade and Challenge modes provide hours of solo entertainment, and a Multiplayer mode lets players face each other head-on.</desc>

As part of his academic "studies," Raz must enter classmates' minds to solve their problems, ranging from childhood trauma to borderline personality disorders.

 Raz literally walks through an individual's fears, delusions, and rage to solve various object-oriented puzzles and to eliminate potential threats. The human brain guards itself against foreigners poking around the subconscious and will manufacture enemies and barriers to stop Raz before he can resolve whatever psychological ailment is plaguing the host. Among the special powers Raz can call upon are invisibility, confusion, mind control, psychic blasts, and telekinesis.</desc>

		<desc>Inspired by the arcade's 1987 side-scrolling shooter, this 3D PS2 version of R-Type places players in control of a well-armed, side-scrolling spaceship for some old fashioned blast-away combat action. R-Type Final is designed to bring on the tense, fast-paced feel of the original coin-op game while adding console-friendly features such as customizable ships, multiple difficulty settings, and a mode that allows player to battle against AI-controlled versions of their own ships. Following the four games it introduced stateside in 2002, Fresh Games publishes R-Type Final in the U.S. and Canada, returning to its strategy of bringing distinct Japanese console games to North American gamers.   In R-Type Final, your enemy is the Bydo, an evil (and living) weapon capable of reproducing itself. Humanity has fought the Bydo four times so far, and each time was victorious. However, each time the Bydo appears it is stronger than before, and now it's back and you need to destroy it again!</desc>

		<path>./Ratchet &amp; Clank (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).gz</path>
		<name>Ratchet &amp; Clank</name>
		<desc>Ratchet &amp; Clank is a platform/adventure game in a similar vein to the 3D versions of the Rayman, Sonic, Mario, or other games. It involves the two protagonists Ratchet, a furry alien creature, and Clank, a nerdy little robot, going on a quest to find Captain Qwark and ultimately to help save the galaxy. 
 
Ratchet &amp; Clank includes many of the best features of previous similar games, but makes itself unique in a number of ways. Firstly each of the game's levels are huge sweeping vistas with extremely detailed buildings which are visible at all times (i.e. there is no distance fog). This means that a building on the horizon is not just a "backdrop"; in all likelihood Ratchet will be exploring it in a few moments time. Secondly, the game includes a number of sub-games, such as a space fight sequence and a number of turret shoot-outs which are akin to Missile Command in the first person. 
 
The game has over twenty levels (planets) and includes as many real-time cut-scenes which tell the story. Also of note is that the story is non-linear, requiring the player to return to previous levels to complete objectives and to choose between multiple paths forward. There is also a respectable array of weapons, gadgets, and accessories to find or buy as the game progresses, which offer some unique gameplay features.</desc>

		<desc>Ratchet: Deadlocked is the fourth game in the Ratchet &amp; Clank series by Insomniac Games. The storyline involves Ratchet and Clank, along with Al, being kidnapped and forced to compete in a underground reality show called "DreadZone" run by the media mogul Gleeman Vox on the outer fringes of the galaxy.  
 
The game differs from its predecessors in that it focuses more on shooting than platforming and puzzle elements. The game allows you to use two bots to fight along side you, which can be upgraded over time with better weapons and firepower. There is a total of  10 weapons in the game, significantly less than the other games. However, modding these weapons is more emphasized than before, with different kinds of Alpha and Omega mods. Omega mods can be used on any weapon, and range from the freeze mod to the magma mod. Alpha mods are weapon-specific, and increase the rate of fire, ammo capacity, and power. The game also features online multiplayer. 
 
Clank is not a playable character in this game, although he gives advice to Ratchet over his communication link.</desc>

		<desc>Resident Evil - Outbreak takes a turn from previous outings in the survival horror series by featuring a multiplayer online component. The narrative is broken down into chapters, allowing up to four players to experience the world of Resident Evil together for the first time. Players initially choose from a lineup of eight characters, six males and two females, who each possess distinct skills or techniques. Some characters may be proficient in a specific style of weapon, while others may be able to open locked doors more efficiently. 
 The choice of characters becomes important since teamwork is often needed to advance through the zombie-filled office buildings, bars, subways, and dilapidated mansions in and around the cursed Raccoon City. One player, for example, may have to distract a group of zombies, while another works on picking a lock or solving a puzzle as quickly as possible. Resident Evil: Outbreak requires a broadband connection in order to play online, but the game also features a single-player mode for those brave enough to go it alone.</desc>

		<name>Return to Castle Wolfenstein : Opération Résurrection</name>
		<desc>Coming a full 20 years after the original Castle Wolfenstein and nearly a decade after the first groundbreaking 3D sequel, Return to Castle Wolfenstein updates a video gaming landmark for the next generation of players. In this release, Nazi-bane B.J. Blazkowicz makes his return to a Castle Wolfenstein that is rendered in full 3D with state-of-the-art graphical effects, built on a special version of the Quake III Arena engine. 
 As in earlier editions in the series, this first-person shooter is set during World War II and takes place deep in the heart of a remote castle that serves as a Nazi stronghold. In the role of B.J., the player becomes involved in a violent adventure of deadly warfare and forbidden occult practices. Utilizing many of the technological advances developed since the release of earlier Wolfenstein games, this sequel is designed to create environments that are as engagingly interactive as possible.</desc>

		<desc>Rez is a fast-action shooter that takes you deep into the world’s computer network. The “Project K” Network has recently been upgraded to handle the rapid expansion of the information age and the core, known as “Eden,” holds the most advanced artificial intelligence the world has ever seen. Unfortunately, Eden cannot handle the ability to create her own thoughts and buckles under the pressure in an existential breakdown. She is lost deep inside the system, and you’re the only one that can bring her back online, saving the world from utter chaos. 
 
You must blast complex viruses, unlock passwords, and destroy firewall bosses as you search for Eden. Each stage is in a constant state of flux dependent on your shooting techniques, which ultimately control the music and colors of your environment. The deeper you get into the dreamlike cyber world of Rez, your form will evolve or devolve depending on your progress.</desc>

		<desc>20 years ago, an alternate World War II occurred, where both Axis and Allies developed mecha technology, known as Armored Fighting Walkers (AFWs). As a result, battles continued in different ways and Russian forces were more instrumental in the eventual defeat of Japan. The end of the war has had Japan divided between  the allied forces, similar to Germany. Japan is now split into a communist North Japan and an Democratic South Japan, governed separately. Without any obvious cause, Japan erupted into civil war between it's halves for four years. Dubbed the "Japan War", it further weakened Japan's economy and fueled resentment between people living in the North and the South. In 1964, Masami von Weizegger is a AFW pilot in the South Japan forces. While field testing a prototype AFW, it is stolen by North Japanese agents and Masami is dispatched to recover the stolen material. As Masami's team attempts to retrieve the AFW, they stumble into a military operation that threatens to erupt into all-out war.</desc>

Johnny Garland is a young man who has lost his family and his memory in a terrible accident. It turns out that he inherited a fortune from his father, but he is not interested in money, but in re-discovering his own past. For that reason, Johnny becomes a private investigator. He receives an assignment which involves capturing an escaped convict. During the investigation, Johnny meets Shania, a native American woman who works as a monster-hunter. From that point on, the destinies of the two are linked together...

		<name>Shadow of Rome</name>
		<desc>Shadow of Rome is a third-person, action-adventure game with some elements of racing. The game has two types of gameplay: close quarters combat levels involving Agrippa and stealth-based, puzzle-solving adventure levels involving Octavianus.[2] There are also levels in which Agrippa competes in chariot races.[3] 
Agrippa uses various gladiator weapons to fight, including swords, maces, spears, among others.[3] Agrippa can use special moves such as "Red Volcano"â€”a move used to slice enemies in halfâ€” to please the crowds.[2] As a result, the crowd will throw down items to help Agrippa.[4] Once a weapon is used enough, it will break, and the player will have to find a new one inside the area.[3] 
In Octavianus' levels, the player sneaks around various locations in Rome. Octavianus cannot kill enemies, he can only knock them out. Other ways to pass these levels are by hiding in large pots or by stealing clothes and impersonating someone.[3]</desc>

		<desc>End-level bosses are standard fare in video games, but the bosses are the levels in this unusual adventure. Developed by the studio that created the PS2's critically acclaimed Ico, Shadow of the Colossus is another fantasy-themed puzzle adventure that's light on dialog and heavy on beautifully expressive environments.   Players take the role of a young knight who sets out to rescue his sleeping-beauty princess from a magic-induced state of suspended animation. To do so, he'll need to defeat the 16 Colossi -- landscape-sized enemies so enormous that they can only be conquered by exploring them, platform-game style, to discover their weaknesses. Against some Colossi, the hero may ride his faithful steed alongside the monster, galloping at full speed just to keep up with its mile-long strides. Other Colossi require the player to actually climb aboard, and crawl, run, and leap across their massive forms to find the hidden vulnerability that can be used to bring them down.</desc>

The only chance for mankind's survival is a top-secret starship class known as Silpheed and the hyper-skilled pilots at the controls. And so begins the premise of Silpheed: The Lost Planet, a co-development shooting project between Game Arts and Treasure that remakes the early '90s PC shooter of the same name. Features include a large variety of enemy types, multiple weapon upgrades, and polygonal graphics. As an added bonus, Working Designs has removed the slowdown and added analog control for the American version of the game.</desc>

		<name>The Sims 2</name>
		<desc>The Sims 2 is a 2004 strategic life simulation video game developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts. It is the sequel to the best-selling computer game The Sims. 
 
The game has the same concept as its predecessor: players control their Sims in various activities and form relationships in a manner similar to real life. The Sims 2, like its predecessor, does not have a defined final goal; gameplay is open-ended. Sims have life goals, wants and fears, the fulfillment of which can produce both positive or negative outcomes. All Sims age, and can live to 90 sim days depending on the degree to which their aspirations are fulfilled. The Sims 2 builds on its predecessor by allowing Sims to age through six stages of life and incorporating a 3D graphics engine. Although gameplay is not linear, storylines exist in the game's pre-built neighborhoods. Pleasantview is based 25 years after the town in the original The Sims. Strangetown's storyline is based on the supernatural, and is loosely connected with Pleasantview. Veronaville's characters are based on Shakespearean characters. 
 
The Sims 2 was first released on September 14, 2004 for Microsoft Windows. A port to Mac OS X was released on June 17, 2005. Eight expansion packs and nine stuff packs were subsequently released. In addition several console versions have been released. The Sims 2 is offered on mobile platforms, with manufacturers such as Nokia offering The Sims 2 from the Ovi Store. A sequel, The Sims 3, was released in June 2009. 
 
The Sims 2 was a commercial success, selling one million copies in its first ten days, a record at the time. During April 2008, The Sims 2 website announced that 100 million copies of The Sims series had been sold. The Sims 2 was well received by critics, gaining a 90% score from aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings. By March 2012, The Sims 2 had sold over six million PC copies, and 13 million over all platforms, making it one of the best-selling PC games of all-time.</desc>

Sly is the fastest, most agile member of the band of thieves and still is the character you play with the most. But certain missions require the special abilities of Bentley, who is smart and can drop bombs, as well shoot enemies from a distance. Other missions require the muscles of Murray, who can lift nearly everything, including enemies. 
 
The main goal of the game is the retrieval of a number of clockwork pieces from different locations around the world. Each theft has to be prepared with a number of sub-missions which have to be completed before the 'real thing' can begin.</desc>

Although they are still weary from the adventures in the previous game, they have to get up and face the new threat that could mean the end of Sly's business and the loss of his family heritage. The game itself is a lot like the previous games: Sly sneaks, jumps, and swings himself around the levels, collecting various items, defeating bad guys and ultimately taking on the boss character.

		<desc>Sniper Elite is a third-person action strategy game with a focus on sniping. The player takes on the role of an American agent working for the OSS (the organization that later became the CIA) stationed in Berlin at the end of World War II, tasked with preventing the Russian troops from getting hold of the research Germany had been conducting into nuclear weaponry. As an elite sniper, the style of play is much less run-and-gun and much more about finding good positions, lining up shots and taking out the enemy before he even knows where you are. 
 
The single-player campaign takes place over 28 missions set in and around Berlin. Players use stealth tactics, and things like wind and background noise can be a factor when lining up shots. When a shot is performed particularly well, players are rewarded with a 'bullet cam' which follows the bullet in slow-motion from gun barrel to target. It can be played with a friend in local 2-player co-op. Players can revive each other.</desc>

Typical missions consist of killing terrorists, rescuing hostages, retrieving intelligence, or destroying terrorist bases. 
 
The player character's codename is Kahuna, while the NPC teammates' codenames are Boomer, Spectre and Jester. The team is divided into two sub-groups, Alpha and Bravo. The Alpha group consists of the player and Boomer, while the remaining two make up Bravo. Commands can be issued to both individuals and a whole group, for example it is possible to ask team Bravo to remain stationary while the player is scouting the area with Boomer. However the player can not venture alone through a map, when Kahuna is too far away from Boomer he will automatically resume following the player, regardless of prior orders. Briefings and intel such as maps and photos are given prior to each mission.</desc>

		<desc>SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs: Combined Assault is a video game for the PlayStation 2 that was released on November 7, 2006 in North America. 
 
Combined Assault's campaign mode offers 18 missions. The game takes place solely in the fictional country of Adjekistan. The country is supposedly situated somewhere in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region of Central Asia, featuring a number of different environment and climate zonesâ€”allowing for the game to feature a wide variety of landscapes and settings while working within one large, connected story. The online servers were shut down on August 31, 2012[1] Although the Combined Assault servers were shut down, some gamers still play via LAN using programs like Xlink Kai.[citation needed]</desc>

Players can switch between third person and first person depending on their preference, and will shoot a lot of hideous demonic manifestations of evil before the game is done. The player is also able to transform into a hideous creature at key times in the game, which allows him to engage in intense melee combat. The game includes a morality system which records the player's actions during gameplay and changes the story accordingly, and also alters the player's creature form. Everything from the first The Suffering has been refined and turned up a notch for the sequel. 
 
The story picks up right where the first game left off. The player once again takes on the role of Torque, former death row inmate with a mysterious past. Now returning to his home town of Baltimore, Torque must confront the mysterious Blackmore, the man who may or may not have killed Torque's family. But it won't be easy, as the hideous creatures from the first game have now overrun the streets of Baltimore. Will Torque finally be able to come to grips with his past?</desc>

		<name>Suikoden IV</name>
		<desc>An orphan boy was brought up in a noble household on the island of Razril, part of a federation known as the Island Nations, which is threatened by their powerful neighbor, the Kooluk Empire. When the boy grows up, he trains together with other young people, hoping to become a knight in the Gaien order. One day, during an escort mission, the knights' ship is attacked by pirates. Through a series of events, the hero is branded with the Rune of Punishment, one of the twenty-seven legendary True Runes. While devastating the enemies, this rune is also bound to deplete its bearer's life. Blamed for the death of his commander, who was unable to withstand the power of the rune, the young knight is exiled from his homeland. He must find a way to use his powers for the good of the Island Nations, fight against a Kooluk invasion, and restore his honor in the process. 
 
Suikoden IV is a prequel to the entire series. The events of the game take place a hundred and fifty years before those of the first game, and the region of the Suikoden universe they occur in are the islands south of Toran. The game retains many classic features of the series: the ability to recruit 108 characters (Stars of Destiny);  building and customization of army headquarters (this time a large ship instead of a castle); emphasis on political issues in the story; the ability to equip runes of various kinds in combat that allow the usage of magic spells, etc.  
 
The amount of active combatants in the party has been reduced from six to four in this installment. Once again, there are three types of combat in the game: the most frequent turn-based party-vs.-party combat, duels, and tactical battles, which now take place on sea. The player can customize the the naval forces by choosing captains and commanding officers, and assigning to them runic elements. Each element has strengths and weaknesses to another one, and the player must use them tactically to gain the upper hand. Ship placement on the battle grid and attack angles play a role as well. 
 
New to the series is ship navigation - instead of exploring an overworld on foot, the player navigates a ship, discovering new lands and islands. Also for the first time in the series there is voice acting, a fully rotatable camera, and the possibility to navigate the main character from first-person perspective.</desc>

All of the levels from those two games are available in this collection, and all of the minigames are already unlocked and included. Formerly only available to GameCube players, the Super Monkey Ball series has made it to the PS2 and Xbox after a wait of almost 3 and a half years. The game itself plays very much like the old arcade game Marble Madness. You control a monkey in a ball, and you have to navigate it through many perilous labyrinths to the finish. In the previous two games you had limited lives/tries, but here you have infinite lives, which makes it all the easier.</desc>

Tekken 5 brings back the popular cast of characters from the previous games along with three new characters for a total of 20 default characters to start, with even more to unlock as you progress in the game. The game allows players to use fight money to customize their character with various accessories such as hats, glasses and an assortment of different costumes. Each of the new characters is equipped with a variety of deadly techniques, and the returning characters have been updated with new moves and combos. New to Tekken 5 is a bonus action adventure game that unfolds a side story to the action-packed fighting sequences. 
After the completion of The King of Iron Fist Tournament 4, a fierce battle between father and son unfolded at Mishima Zaibatsu headquarters. Jin emerges as the victor in this battle and continues to defeat Heihachi, his grandfather - but spares both Kazuya and Heihachi's lives in honour of his mother who loved peace. Soon after Jin's departure, a swarm of Jacks arrive at Honmaru and begin to attack Heihachi and Kazuya - and in order to escape, Kazuya thrusts Heihachi into the swarm of Jacks. A great explosion destroys Honmaru, and a man watching from afar reports, "Heihachi Mishima is dead." While many presume the death of Heihachi Mishima will end the reign of Mishima Zaibatsu, an announcement is made for the fifth King of Iron Fist Tournament, with an unknown replacement to Heihachi leading the organization. The fight begins once again.</desc>

		<name>Time Crisis : Crisis Zone</name>
		<desc>Crisis Zone is a spin-off of the popular Time Crisis arcade shooters, released in 29 March 1999 in the arcades. 
 
A PlayStation 2 (PS2) remake of the game was released in 2004 in the UK and the US with more detailed polygons and textures, higher difficulty, redone voice acting and an additional mission taking place six months after the Crisis Zone Arcade mode. 
 
The PS2 port is compatible with the GunCon (G-Con 45 in Europe) and Guncon 2 lightgun, and is available with an unusual two-player cooperative gameplay mode named "two-gun mode" by allowing two players to play simultaneously on a single-player mode without the use of split-screen, or weapon switching system (similar to Time Crisis 3, with some changes) allowing the player to switch between a fully automatic machine gun, a standard 8-round handgun and a 6-round shotgun, depending on settings. 
 
Unlike Time Crisis 3 and Time Crisis 4, where only the handgun has unlimited ammunition and other weapons are replenished by shooting certain enemies, all weapons now have unlimited ammunition in Crisis Zone, though they all must be reloaded. As with the PlayStation 2 version of Time Crisis II and Time Crisis 3, players can access the Crisis Mission exercise menu through prolonged gameplay. The US version of the PS2 remake is called Time Crisis: Crisis Zone.</desc>

Each zone contains three portals, each of which lead to a level.[4] The goal of each level is to obtain a select amount of thunder eggs, which can be retrieved by either performing a certain task, completing a "Time Attack" challenge that can be unlocked upon said level's completion, freeing five bilbies,[2] a group of animals who raised Ty after his parents were imprisoned, or by being found alongside the level's set path.[2] A level is cleared either by collecting a select amount of thunder eggs and reaching the end of the path, or beating certain min-games, each will return Ty to Rainbow Cliffs hub world.[2] Retrieving a thunder egg in a level will cause it to appear on the game's pause menu.[5] When at least seventeen thunder eggs in a zone are obtained, the player must navigate their way to the talisman machine; after the machine manages to locate a talisman, it opens another portal leading to their original locations; inside these portals, the player must fight and defeat a boss character before gaining access to a new zone</desc>

		<desc>TY the Tasmanian Tiger 2 is a 3D Platformer with an Australian theme. The player takes the role of TY, a Tasmanian tiger, armed with sharp teeth and boomerangs a-plenty. On TY's quest to defeat the evil Boss Cass and his army of cold-blooded Frilled Lizards, he must assist the colorful residents of Burramudgee Town and the Southern Rivers, who include a tree frog, a lyre bird, a platypus family, some kangaroos and more koalas than you can shake a didgeridoo at. 
 
While most of the game is standard platform fare, there are some diversions. Notably, there are a number of cart racing tracks which can be played with a friend. Additionally, there are missions that will place the player in giant robots, each with a different speciality (one is good at battle, one can put out fires, one is a submarine, etc.). 
 
There are many comedic quirks, having the players throw electrified boomerangs at robotic dinosaurs in the Outback, then send them up in a helicopter to rescue sheep stranded by a flood, then have them clear a road following a traffic accident. And finally, to top it all off, the save/continue points are outhouses.</desc>

Since your enemies are armed to the teeth (usually with meat cleavers, Molotov cocktails, and sawed-off shotguns), you're equipped with a riot shield that can be used by holding the left trigger. It can absorb an infinite amount of projectiles, but you cannot shoot while you are using it. You can get the assistance of firefighters to put out fires, and medics to replenish your health. 
 
Your weapons can be upgraded by earning medals during your missions. You can earn these medals by scoring headshots, arresting enemies with your taser (as opposed to killing them), collecting gang masks, etc. You can even unlock extra missions and weapons by arresting gang leaders at the end of each level, so that the police can interrogate him and find out the gang's next move.</desc>

		<name>Valkyrie Profile 2 : Silmeria</name>
		<desc>Hundreds of years before Lenneth's tale, another saga lies concealed by the gods. The valkyrie Silmeria once served Odin loyally, but after an incident ignited a conflict between them, Odin forcefully reincarnated her as a human. The human soul that would carry her spirit was that of Alicia, Princess of Dipan. Ordinarily, Silmeria-s consciousness would have been sealed, her spirit dormant until she was next summoned... However, the forced transmigration causes Silmeria's spirit to awaken within Alicia, leaving two souls to inhabit a single body. The spirit that should have been sealed has awakened-a situation Odin will not ignore for long. This installment introduces the new Photon Action System to the classic side-scrolling action format found in the original. Projecting photons grants players more freedom to explore and expands the action, resulting in challenging puzzles with clever solutions. Add to that "sealstones" that affect the laws of nature in dungeons, launching strategy to new heights. The unique battle system of the previous game has evolved into the Advanced Tactical Combination Battle System.</desc>

		<name>Virtua Fighter 4 : Evolution</name>
		<desc>Evolution was an updated version of Virtua Fighter 4. The game introduced two new characters and adjusted every other character as well. The two new characters were the Judoka-assassin, Goh Hinogami and the Muay Thai boxer Brad Burns. With the addition of Brad Burns, Vanessa Lewis's alternate Muay Thai style from Virtua Fighter 4 was removed and replaced with a Vale Tudo "Offensive" style; making her a solely Vale Tudo brawler.    All of the stages were adjusted. For example, Lei-Fei's stage in Virtua Fighter 4 previously took place during sunset, in Evolution it takes place during the morning.</desc>

		<name>Wakeboarding Unleashed featuring Shaun Murray</name>
		<desc>Wakeboarding is part of Activision's line of Extreme Sports titles. A rider (using a board that's like a combination of a surf board, body board and skateboard) is pulled along the water by rope at high speeds by the boat up front, and must pull of tricks either by jumping of jumps or using the wake left by the boat itself (hence the sport's name). 
 
Unleashed takes this sport and turns it upside down, allowing you to fly down water ways through well known locations around the world, pulling stunts off buildings or cliff faces. Other objectives are included that have you completing tasks and busting tricks in a unique way. 
 
Multiplayer modes include one-on-one trick attack and horse, where both players compete against each other to pull off the best tricks. Co-operative mode has one player driving the boat while the other hangs on behind, with new challenges for the boat driver to complete as well as the rider.</desc>

		<desc>Although it is essentially a remake of the original PlayStation version of Wild Arms, Alter Code F brings enhanced gameplay, improved graphics, and an expanded storyline to the PS2. Players take command of three unlikely companions in a surreal and desolate world called Filgaia. The young orphan Rudy has a unique ability to physically bond with "ARMs," or "Ancient Relic Machines," which seem to have been left behind by a forgotten civilization. The runaway princess Cecelia can command forces of magic, and the swordsman Jack is adept at a number of trades. These three "Dream Chasers" seek their fortunes in the unforgiving countryside, and might just end up saving the whole world along the way. The role-playing adventure includes overworld exploration and intense dungeon-crawling. Wild ARMs: Alter Code F is compatible with the PlayStation 2 HDD, so veteran PS2 gamers with older model consoles and the hard drive accessory can load the large, two-DVD game program to disk in order to decrease load times.</desc>

		<name>Wild Arms 3</name>
		<desc>The first two games in the Wild Arms series garnered attention and acclaim as they brought classic console role-playing to the original PlayStation. Though crafted in the same story-telling spirit, Wild Arms 3 (titled Wild Arms Advanced 3rd in Japan) boasts major technological improvements and a number of new gameplay elements. Featuring "stroke-shaded" animation-style graphics, a "Wild West" setting, and a completely 3D game engine (not just for battles, as in the previous games), Wild Arms 3 is designed to make good use of the power of the PlayStation 2. 
 
Wild Arms 3 features four main characters and takes the time to let players become acquainted with each of them. The "drifters" Virginia, Gallows, Jet, and Clive are four very different adventurers whose paths intertwine toward a shared destiny. Though each has his or her own personal motivations, all four seek an explanation for why the once-verdant lands of Filgaia have become dry and barren. Differences must be overcome and the characters must act in harmony if they are to truly understand the ancient mystical forces at work. 
 
As the drifters move through the desolate land of Filgaia, they are challenged with a number of mysteries to solve and barriers to overcome. The different special abilities of each character must be used to solve different parts of the game's complex puzzles. A technique dubbed "expressive communication" is designed to allow players to quickly gauge the moods and emotions of the onscreen characters. Monsters, villains, and other horrible creatures stand between the drifters and their destinations as well. The Wild Arms 3 turn-based battle system is designed to offer players an intricate level of control, allowing tactics that make wise use of the various powers and weaponry of the drifters while presenting combat with cinematic flair. 
 
 
Wild Arms 3 delivers everything RPG gamers expect: an in-depth storyline, puzzling dungeons &amp; a unique battling system. Journey along with Virginia, Jet, Clive and Gallows and discover the mystery behind the Prophets to revive the memories of Filgaia. Explore dungeons to unlock secret pathways and find mythical treasures. Gun Blazing shoot-outs deliver intense cinematic battles. Wild Arms 3 embodies tried-and-true elements of a role-playing classic.</desc>

But one day, your world is shattered to pieces, and you descend onto the earth to face the terrible reality: the world of Filgaia was devastated by wars. A few settlements amidst rusty tanks is all that is left of civilization. The democratically elected government has some plans for improving the conditions of the world, but as you meet a young girl whom they used as a tool for their purpose, you realize you must find a better plan to save her, and the world, from complete destruction. 
 
The fourth installment of the Wild Arms series abandons its traditional Wild West theme and is set in a post-apocalyptic world. The gameplay system introduces hex-based battles. Battle screens are divided into seven hexes, each one of which can hold several party members or foes. You navigate your characters on the battle field, trying to force the enemy into an uncomfortable position. There is also a variety of skills you can learn and apply in battles to get benefits. As in previous Wild Arms games, the dungeons contain many environmental puzzles to solve.</desc>

WINBACK 2 brings to the series a new "route" system that lets players experience each mission from the perspective of different operatives. There are 30 intense missions, multiple difficulty levels, and new weapons including the highly-anticipated sniper rifle. The new Winback assault team is comprised of three young, yet combat-proven operatives led by Craig Contrell. Each team member is qualified in six different weapon types and highly-adept at CQB (Close Quarter Battle). They are masters of target identification, engagement and shot placement. In the hands of the player, all of these techniques will be put to the test. The game's unique shooting action is spread across 30 high-risk operations situated in challenging urban environments and conveyances.</desc>

A new Zone mode requires players to drive as many loops as possible on a track while continuously increasing the speed. 
Another new feature in WipEout Fusion are hovercraft upgrades.

Ash can crouch and roll to evade enemy fire. The gameplay is predominantly action-oriented; Ash and his friends have to deal with enemy soldiers, automated guns, and boss enemies. Other tasks are usually confined to hitting switches in order to open doors.</desc>

		<name>Xenosaga Episode I : Der Wille zur Macht</name>
		<desc>Xenosaga: Episode I - Der Wille zur Macht, the first chapter of a trilogy, is a Japanese-style sci-fi role-playing game, sharing many common themes and gameplay elements with Xenogears. The battle system is not unlike the one used in Xenogears (combo attacks, AP and EP gauges, etc.), but random encounters are eliminated. Instead, the enemies are now visible and battles can be avoided. During combat the few upcoming ally and enemy turns are shown onscreen, allowing the player to make strategic decisions based on who will act next. A rolling slot moves with each turn as well, conferring a bonus such as added damage or bonus XP for any action on that turn. If the enemy would be in position to take an advantage then the player can expend a character's "boost" gauge to cut in and act next, although enemies can boost as well, and enemy boosts always over-ride player boosts.  
 
Each character has a unique tree of Ether spells they can learn by spending Ether points earned in battle, with lower spells requiring spells above them to be purchased first. After a spell is purchased, so long is it does not require a unique talent of that character, the spell can also be purchased and learned by any other character that can afford double its normal cost. The Anti-Gnosis Weapon Systems can be equipped with different weapons and accessories and can be used in combat provided that a character has enough AP on that turn to board their AGWS.</desc>

When he is attacked by BAHRAM forces who have come to seize it, Dingo climbs into Jehuty and engages the attackers. During the battle, Dingo enters the BAHRAM battleship, seemingly defeating Nephtis, an Orbital Frame controlled by an A.I. program based on Viola's fighting style, but is subdued by Anubis, Jehuty's superior counterpart controlled by Col. Ridley (Nohman) Hardiman, leader of BAHRAM. 
 
As a prisoner, Dingo is assaulted by Ken Marinaris, a female Orbital Frame runner that Dingo defeated in the previous battle. Nohman arrives moments later and asks Dingo to join him. When Dingo refuses, Nohman shoots him, ordering Ken to dispose of the body. Instead, Ken has Dingo revived and placed inside Jehuty. When he comes to, she explains that Jehuty is acting as a life-support system, and if he leaves Jehuty, he will die. She then tells him that she is a UNSF spy. Dingo escapes with Taper and heads for Mars.</desc>

The game features multiple tables in which the player must complete a given set of tasks before he can proceed to the next level.

 This latter-day pinball game for PS2 is designed to offer a wide variety of game modes, contemporarily cutting-edge graphics, and surrealistic action. The game's main mode features over 100 missions, in more than 70 game levels, on five differently themed tables -- Biology, Metallurgy, Optics, Geometry, and Theology. "Free Play" and two-player mini-game modes are also available. Developed at Sony Computer Entertainment's Japanese headquarters, Flipnic flips Stateside thanks to Capcom.</desc>

		<name>Aliens Versus Predator : Extinction</name>
		<desc>The battle that has split more blood over centuries continues, with the human marines caught in-between the powerful Aliens and the deadly Predators. 
 
Moving away from the FPS series on PC, Extinction has you controlling one of the three races in a real time strategy mix, building each unit and setting them out into the battlefield to complete a range of tasks. 
 
Each race has an advantage and disadvantage. The humans have a collection of different units, from heavy weapons experts to medics, and are better known for their long range attacks. Predators are hardcore fighters, taking the battle right up to the enemy, although there are fewer of them available to counter act their superior power. Finally, the Aliens are fast and deadly, and always hunt in large packs. 
 
Upgrade weapons and use terrain to an advantage in each level to make certain your team (whoever or whatever they may be) survive until the next battle.</desc>

		<name>Fire Pro Wrestling Returns</name>
		<desc>Fire ProWrestling Returns is a 2D-graphic based wrestling simulation game. The game has a north-south/east-west-axis movement system. This allows for dual-plane movement rendering it to play like a 3D wrestling game (although the moves are still done in 2D). 
 
The game features 327 wrestlers on the main roster, from over 10 major Japanese wrestling and mixed-martial arts organizations. This in-depth roster allows the player to simulate classic matches or matches that could never take place. 
 
Game modes include a standard exhibition match, tag team exhibition match with 2, 3 or 4 player teams, a round robin league tournament featuring up to 64 wrestlers, a sudden elimination tournament featuring up to 16 wrestlers, mixed martial arts matches aka Ultimate Fighting (with either Pride or K*1 Rules), battle royal matches with up to eight players in the ring at the same time, 5-man team elimination matches and for the first time ever in a Fire ProWrestling game, a North American cage match mode. 
 
The edit mode allows you to create wrestlers, referees and even entire wrestling organizations (with their own ring and logo). This mode features over 1,648 moves and holds you can assign to your wrestlers, and you can then tweak their CPU logic, so as to make them behave as you like when controlled by the computer. 
 
The new features for the Fire ProWrestling series debuting in Fire ProWrestling Returns are North American cage matches, face layering on edit mode, and ring seconds (aka managers) that accompany wrestlers to the ring. It also features over 20 brand new moves, including some reanimations of old moves.</desc>

		<name>Freekstyle</name>
		<desc>Freekstyle is a EA Sports' take on motocross racing. This game is all about going fast and doing cool tricks. There are essentially two games here: first there is a straightforward racing game, where you race three laps around a circuit and attempt to finish first. The second part of the game is a freestyle competition, where you perform tricks to score points, and attempt to rack up the biggest total. 
 
The racing game, or "Freekstyle" mode, combines racing and tricks. You will race around a circuit track, and attempt to perform tricks at the big jumps you encounter along the way. Performing tricks fills your boost meter, which then gives you a speed boost you can use at your discretion. If you perform enough tricks, eventually you can break into "freakout" mode, where you can travel at ludicrous speed. 
 
Freekstyle features the voices and likeness of several real-life motocross stars.</desc>

To set the dice off, you must roll the top face of the die you're standing on next to the same number of interconnected die with the same face (i.e. connect five 5's, four 4's). After a set period of time, the dice will explode, igniting any dice that the explosion touches that either match the number, or are one lower. This game is very fast-paced - you have to keep moving, because if you're on top of an exploding die, you get knocked out and you lose the game.

Career mode puts the player in the role of Max Axel, who is tasked with winning the coveted Drome Championship. To do so, he must work his way through the ranks by completing a number of Multi-Challenge Races; a series of races in which the completion time in one round is carried over to the next. For example, if Max finished three seconds behind in the last race, the leader is awarded a three-second head start in the next. The overall winner is the first to cross the finish line in the final race of the series. Preceding each Multi-Challenge series is a qualifying drag race, where victory is determined by a good start and proper gear-shifting. Max Axel is aided by other such Team Nitro members as Shicane who handles car upgrades, and Rocket, who gives advice. The winnings can be put toward building a new car or upgrading the existing one.</desc>

		<desc>CIA agent Zoe Nightshade, a mole in Identicon Corporation, based in Hong Kong, is discovered and captured. Identicon, a botanical research firm, is a possible front for a weapons-smuggling ring. James Bond infiltrates the facility in an attempt to rescue her, as well as retrieve a suspicious courier case in the same building. After freeing Nightshade from a submarine set to launch, the pair flee the facility with the courier case. Nigel Bloch, the head of Identicon, has his forces chase the agents through the streets of Hong Kong. The two steal a second case of vials from a nearby Identicon factory. They then rendezvous with R, who provides Bond with a gadget-laden BMW Z8. A limousine pulls up, as an assassin inside launches a rocket at the agents, killing Zoe, and steals the case. Bond gives chase, stopping an armored van which contained the stolen vials. 
 
The vials contain nine blood samples, eight of which contained blood of world leaders. One contains the blood of British diplomat Reginald Griffin, serving in Romania, who is obsessed with protecting a room, outside of his jurisdiction, in the embassy. Bond investigates the embassy, finding Griffin dead, before a similar-looking man attacks him. After overcoming him, Bond finds a message from Bloch on Griffin's computer that mentions Malprave Industries, based in Switzerland. Bond takes the information from the computer and escapes.</desc>

In third-person, Bond can move, take cover, aim and shoot with a lock-on system, engage in hand-to-hand combat, use his spy gadgets and perform some context sensitive actions. The lock-on system has a precision aiming dot that can be moved with the right thumb stick to target specific areas of the body. It does not snap to said specific areas making it possible to completely miss your target. 
 
A unique feature, "Bond sense", allows you to see the world how Bond does, allowing you to spot things that Bond can interact with. Using Bond sense slows down time so the player may have a chance to spot objects or enemies, but the player cannot move or take action without deactivating Bond sense. 
 
Two players can play through a co-op campaign that uses some areas from the single player campaign but adds unique scenarios and maps to the mix.</desc>

		<desc>Building on 007: Everything or Nothing's range of strengths, 007: From Russia with Love is based on the 1963 film starring Sean Connery as James Bond. He is sent to Istanbul to acquire the Russian decoder machine known as the Lektor from a (supposedly) defecting Russian agent by the name of Tatiana Romanova.  However, the Russians have no knowledge of this plan because it is a trap for James Bond created by the criminal organization known as Octopus.  It is up to James Bond to seize the device and confront the dangerous assassin Red Grant and the ruthless Rosa Klebb. 
 
In most of the 18 missions the player progresses through linear levels while shooting everything in sight. The player can lock onto an enemy at range and cycle between visible enemies, or focus in closer on a single enemy to make opportunistic targets appear, such as uncovered grenades or gaps in armor. Sometimes Bond can also use stealth or hand-to-hand combat, which are basically quick-time events where the player needs to press a displayed button in a limited time to dispatch a foe. Special tasks can be preformed with gadgets, e.g. the laser watch or a small remote controlled helicopter. This procedure gets spiced up with occasional driving or new jet pack sequences. 
 
The player gets rewarded for certain actions with bonus points, e.g. succeeding in melee combat or searching containers. There are three different kind of points which unlock different things: bonus content like making of videos, bonus levels, and weapon upgrades. Every weapon and gadget can be upgraded in different areas, but only once.</desc>

 Points are earned based on three conditions: the time it takes to reach the finish line, the amount of cargo left intact after hitting objects, and whether or not players finished ahead of their rival. Completing the route before the competition unlocks one of three mini-games where players are challenged to park in specially designated areas within a certain amount of time. Finishing the objective reveals a horn, muffler, or engine to boost an 18-wheeler's performance.</desc>

		<name>187 : Ride or Die</name>
		<desc>187: Ride Or Die combines fighting and car racing through different game modes, including online play. In all game modes, you have to control both driving and shooting at the same time. 
 
187 Ride Or Die takes place in the "gangsta" universe, where you are "Buck", a young thug hired to take out the members of the opposing crew while on the road. The game provides a set of different cars, characters and weapons you can play with. Weapons take a large part in the gameplay: It is quite impossible to win races without using weapons.  
 
There are alternate mission types such as escort missions, car bomb, police escape (the only mode without weapon), and others. There are also deathmatch modes where the goal is to get the maximum of frags on other cars in arena style maps.</desc>

		<desc>Stuntman: Ignition is a game based on the original 2002 Stuntman game. Players assume the role of a Hollywood stunt driver working for a movie studio. Each level is based upon a movie and players will have to drive through the level, earning points by performing stunts. After the end of each level, players can review their performance by watching the movie trailer that was created. 
 
There are six movies to choose from, each with different settings, goals and challenges: Aftershock, Whoopin and a Hollerin' II, Strike Force Omega, Overdrive, Never Kill Me Again and Night Avenger. Each movie consists of 6 scenes where the goals set by the director must be followed. To progress, a successful series of stunts is required, but the amount of points can be increased by linking them together and adding extra danger by drifting, getting airborne, or getting close to other cars and obstacles. 
 
The multiplayer portion offers 2 game modes. In Backlot Battle players have to perform as many stunts as possible in a set amount of laps. Backlot Race offers straightforward racing where boost is earned through stunts. The PS2 version only offers offline gameplay, while the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions have multiplayer supported through the DemonWare middleware.</desc>

Aeon has a health meter and a style meter; when the health meter is depleted, the game is over. The style meter is filled by attacking or killing enemies; when you have earned enough style, you can charge up your combo attacks for extra damage.</desc>

		<desc>Hugo, the TV troll from the Danish television series, is on his way to start his first day at the espionage agency R.I.S.K. (Risky Intelligent Spy Knights) when he is attacked by members of the sinister organization SUSPECTRA. Their plans are threatening the entire city, but Agent Hugo soon discovers there is even more at stake. 
 The game is played as a platformer with racing elements. Agent Hugo can use the R.I.S.K. Aquapolis boat with heat-seeking missiles and nitro acceleration. It can also dive and regular weapons can be used. While avoiding mines, the vessels can launch boomballs to blow up energy facilities, knock out enemies and open gates. Hugo can also swim and board other types of boats. On land, he has to either attack or sneak past enemies, with several disguises to stay undetected. When discovered, a meter starts to fill up. It can only be depleted by shaking off enemies and finding a hiding spot. 
 During his mission Agent Hugo meets members of R.I.S.K, such as Agent 01 &amp; 02, professor W, Ms Alltobright and Honeybunny. Villains include SUSPECTRA chief Dr Nogo and the local bosses of the districts: Kizzi Mi, Oddjaw and Max Schmertz.</desc>

		<desc>Air Ranger Rescue  is a single player game in which the player pilots a rescue helicopter. 
 
There are three helicopters to fly in this game, the MBB/Kawasaki  BK-117-B,  the Boeing CH-47J "Chinook ", and the Hughes/Kawasaki OH-6D. The game consists of eight timed missions each of which has three levels of difficulty, plus in the training section there's also a 'Free Flight' mode. The first missions are flown in the small OH-6D, missions two and above together with the other craft being locked off until the preceding missions have been completed successfully.  
Missions are scored on a points system, victims must be rescued while in good health so points are lost if they are not picked up in good time and, of course, points are deducted should the helicopter hit a building or should a victim die. 
 
The training section is in the form of a manual and it not only explains the game's controls but also the workings of the helicopter and includes sections of video footage.</desc>

Pilot aircraft that span sixty years of aviation including WWII prop planes, Korean War jets, rare prototypes, and even aircraft from previous Konami games like the Vic Viper and TwinBee. 
 
Between missions you can explore the base and talk to wingmates, buy new aircraft and special weapons, modify or repaint existing aircraft, and get mission briefings. Missions can have varied objectives, but any enemy crafts shot down will reward money used to buy, modify, and repair aircraft. While Ken Thomas is the main character of the game, other pilots can be used in missions as the game progresses, and using them can open up bonus missions as well as alter the story. The player can only play as Delta Squadron pilots, but the story is told from the perspective of both E.D.A.F.'s Delta Squadron and their O.C.C. Ace counterparts. Medals are awarded to each pilot as they reach milestones, such as number of enemy aces shot down or number of aircraft purchased.</desc>

Kaneda, the leader of a teenage motorcycle gang, was locked in combat with a rival biker group called the Clowns. One night, Kaneda?s buddy Tetsuo was taken into military custody after encountering a strange boy who had been used as a guinea pig for human experimentation. Kaneda sneaked into the military?s research facility to rescue his friend. Once inside, he discovered that the military was using drugs to awaken a mysterious power within Tetsuo, and found many other experimental subjects confined in there as well. One of these subjects, a young girl, predicted the awakening of Akira, the darkest secret of the military scientific program. And so Tetsuo began making his way towards this mysterious Akira, who was sleeping deep under the Earth?s surface...</desc>

There are several real tracks such as Hockenheim and Laguna Seca, as well as the chance to race in scenic Italian locations such as the Tuscanny hills and the Naples coastline. You can play Instant Action mode, in which you unlock these tracks one by one with indestructible cars, and Dynasty Mode, where you aim to build a more realistic career. 
 
What sets the game apart from the crowd is its approach to driver abilities in Dynasty Mode. When setting a driver up, his abilities are split into skill areas such as reflexes and pressure-handling, with points assigned to these.   
 
Further skills such as Heart, Intimidation and Recovery can be developed to improve either car or driver. AI cars have the same features applied to them race by race. 
 
The driver's heartbeat is a featured sound effect, and in pressure situations it can be heard above all other sounds. One available skill is the Tiger Effect, which allows you to rewind the game to avoid dangerous situations as they are about to happen. Its length and efficiency are 2 of the skills which can be improved.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the successful television show, Alias lets players take on the role of Sydney Bristow, a stealth operative working for the CIA. The game sets the player against two of Bristow's enemies from the original series in a plot which takes her from Saudi Arabia to Rio de Janeiro as she aims to find out about a mysterious device known only as "The Machine". The game was devised in conjunction with the writers from the show and uses official costumes, character shots and voices. 
 
Players can use a stealth or action approach to get through the levels. With stealth Bristow needs to hug walls and use the correct timing to approach enemies from behind and knock them out. To accomplish this she has a few gadgets to her disposal, e.g. thermal vision or mini cameras. For the more direct method she uses guns found on neutralised enemies or melee combat. The latter knows different fighting styles depending on which weapon Bristow uses, e.g. knifes, unarmed or even a broom. There are also basic puzzles to solve, e.g. opening doors or a hacking mini game. Health regenerates automatically after a certain amount of time.</desc>

Level structure, mechanics of gameplay, and looks of the characters (Sarah, especially) sometimes differ strongly as these versions contain concept elements that were left out of the other game. The driving sequences are almost entirely taken out. The first-person view is also mostly not used, and, for example, fire can be extinguished in the third-person mode. The basic aspects of screenplay are retained, but this can be considered another "what if" instalment in the series, rather than a canonical entry like the other version. The endings have a different look, but remain largely the same.</desc>

It is set in the 29th century where a substance named Multiplast replaces all known construction materials because it can be formed into anything. But something is wrong on the planet Proteus, the only known source of Multiplast. Now the simple worker Nevio has to investigate and stop the megalomaniac shape shifter Paavo who controls an even more powerful substance. 
 
Luckily soon after the beginning of the game Nevo gets his hands on a special suit, which allows him to morph into three forms. The sword form is for melee combat, in which combos can be triggered by using the correct button combinations. The cannon form is a big robot which is more suited for gunplay and the stealth form is a futuristic lizard with a long tongue. During combat the player can instantly switch between the forms, which allows for many combinations depending on the former action or movement. This gets rewarded with plasma points which are used to upgrade Nevio's life energy, new moves or better weapons.</desc>

		<name>Arctic Thunder</name>
		<desc>Arctic Thunder, the fourth installment in Midway's arcade racing series, is a fantasy snowmobile-racing game that plays like a mix of Cruis'n and a kart racer on ice. The main object of the PS2 and Xbox versions is to upgrade sleds and unlock secret characters or tracks. You earn Gold Medals or lots of points to unlock most secrets, and you do this by winning races. The gameplay involves shooting down enemies with weapons, boosting yourself ahead, and pulling off tricks. Exclusive to the console versions is a Battle Mode that emphasizes the game's frantic combat. 
 Like other titles in Midway's pseudo-series, such as Hydro Thunder and 4 Wheel Thunder, this snowmobile racing release combines distinctive environments and a responsive physics model with lots of arcade-style jumps and power-ups. Players race their snow machines across the Swiss Alps, up the Alaskan Pipeline and even through a nuclear energy plant in Chernobyl in a continuing effort to be first across the finish line. Also like others in the series, Arctic Thunder is full of extra sleds, tracks, and other secrets to be unlocked through skillful play.</desc>

It was the second fighting game franchise created by SNK, following the Fatal Fury series and is set in the same fictional universe as a prequel to the Fatal Fury series. 
 The games follow the struggles of the students of the Kyokugen Karate Dojo, Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia, in what appears to be the late 1970s. Ryo is the son of the Kyokugen Karate discipline's creator, Takuma Sakazaki, and Robert is the wayward son of a billionaire family from Italy. The initial two titles are set in South Town, a common location in SNK games that is also the setting for the Fatal Fury series, while the third appears to take place in a fictitious area of Mexico.</desc>

 Asterix &amp; Obelix need to fight their way through countless Roman soldiers in order to find and free the druids hidden in the different themed areas of the park. On their way they team up or fight against several game-inspired NPCs like Sam Shieffer or Larry Craft. To fight foes the characters have several attack combos and special items like the famous magic potion at their disposal. 
 There are also some puzzles, for which you often need to switch between both characters (which you can do at any time) in order to solve them. Asterix, for instance, cannot move a heavy stone out of the way.</desc>

		<desc>He may be small, but only in size. This free-roaming platform adventure stars the original anime hero: the friendly, atomic-powered, robotic youngster called Astro Boy. This lad with "100,000 horse power strength and a heart of gold" has come a long way since his early-'50s debut in Osamu Tezuka's black-and-white comics and cartoons, as Sonic Team now brings him to life in full color, and in full 3D. 
 Luckily for PS2 gamers, Astro Boy's 128-bit makeover leaves intact all of his most famous powers -- they'll need them. Players will make use of the hero's rocket feet, super-human hearing, "digibeam" finger lasers, and other amazing abilities, as they keep the peace in the futuristic metropolis of Metro City. It is here that the hero will face classic villains such as Acheron, Blue Knight, and Atlas. Additional powers are unlocked as Astro Boy accomplishes key objectives.</desc>

		<desc>This is a side-scrolling beat 'em up and shoot 'em up combo based on the 2009 animated 3D movie of the long-running character from manga and anime. Astro Boy must save Metro City from President Stone and his robots while fighting through levels on the ground and in the air. In addition to fighting combination moves, he can shoot a laser from his fingertip and use a special attack if the energy meter is powered enough.  These include an Arm Cannon, Butt Machine Guns and Absorb (recharges a portion of health). Find different power-ups and costumes in hard to reach and hidden areas.  
 
In addition to singleplayer, there is 2-player multiplayer co-op on Wii and PS2 where the second player controls another Astro Boy with a different costume.  In Story Mode, if one person dies, they can later rejoin game with full health after some time elapses. But if both die, then the game is over and must be started over.  There's also an Arena mode where both players fight with robots to determine a winner with the most points.</desc>

		<desc>In the land of Regallzine, there is a special guild of alchemists - people who possess magic powers they draw creatures called "mana". The alchemists are able to manipulate elements and to fuse magical items. One of such alchemists suddenly got the idea of resurrecting an ancient god, claiming it will bring peace and happiness to humanity. To stop the madman, another alchemist, a young man named Klein, enters the scene. Klein is a particularly skillful magic user and has his way with mana, so with the help of his powers he hopes to stop the planned resurrection and to save the world. 
 
The gameplay features traditional turn-based battles against randomly encountered enemies and a role-playing system based on the spiritual mana creatures. The characters use mana to create magical items and also equip it to learn special abilities and to gain bonuses when leveling up. Some mana creatures must be given gifts in order to obey you and to become more powerful. Mana-equipping can also grant you physical abilities which you can use to solve puzzles in dungeons.</desc>

		<name>Atelier Iris 2 : The Azoth of Destiny</name>
		<desc>The story of Atelier Iris 2: The Azoth of Destiny follows Viese and Felt, two orphans from the land of Eden. At the beginning of the story an earthquake has caused vast portions of the land to disappear! Viese and Felt have volunteered to find out what has happened and to prevent the world of Eden from being destroyed completely. With the aid of a magical sword called the Azure Azoth, Felt sets off through a gate to another world called Belkhyde to search for the answer to their trouble while Viesa remains in Eden to take care of things there. 
 
Throughout the game you control Viesa and Felt on their quest. Viesa has just become an alchemist; with the help of the Mana spirits of the world, this gives her the ability to take various items and magically form new items. In order to create a new item, Viesa will need a recipe indicating what ingredients to combine as well as those ingredients. All of these items can be found in various locations throughout the lands, some in Eden and some in Belkhyde. Many of the items Viesa can create with alchemy will be of great help to Felt as he explores Belkhyde and fights in battles; since Felt doesn't have the ability to create items, they will need the help of a share ring which provides the ability to exchange items even though they are in two different worlds. To progress through the game, Felt will often need to coordinate with Viesa to get useful items for either solving puzzles or making battles easier. As Felt explores Belkhyde, he will meet numerous other characters and will need to undergo various quests in order to save Eden.</desc>

However, 100 years previous the Avatar had disappeared, making it possible for the Fire Nation to wage a war of conquest across the world. As the show begins, the new Avatar, Aang (originally an Airbender, hence the title of the series), has been found, and now he must travel the world, learning how to bend all four elements and fighting against the Fire Nation alongside his friends Katara (a Waterbender of the Water Tribe) and Sokka (her older brother).</desc>

		<desc>Step into the shadows of Gotham City's perilous criminal underworld as DC Comics' legendary Dark Knight in the Batman Begins video game. Slated for release day and date with the Warner Bros. Pictures film, Batman Begins challenges players to use fear as their ultimate weapon. 
 A hero is born, in this interactive adaptation of Christopher Nolan's 2005 comics-inspired cinema. Based directly on the movie, the Batman Begins video games are designed to allow players to discover the Batman as for the first time, by exploring the roles of both young Bruce Wayne and his fledgling alter ego. 
 In addition to the combat one would expect from any adventure featuring the grim hero, gameplay involves exploration and stealth. Batman's famous utility belt comes into play, as different gadgets allow him to reach remote areas, survey situations from a safe location, and unleash surprise attacks. The film spotlights its heavy-duty interpretation of the Batmoblie, as well, and the highly versatile vehicle is featured in the game's combat racing sequences.</desc>

You travel around each level in a non-linear fashion.  You have to fight your way through endless hordes to find keys, flip switches, use elevators, and then ultimately defeat a big boss at the end.</desc>

The "Hardcore Tour" mode has you playing the levels, pulling off tricks and completing goals to unlock things such as new levels or stripper videos. The goals are of the odd variety, including things like collecting yellow snow for an icecream man, or gathering empty cans for a homeless guy. Also have to watch out for a health bar which accounts for your injuries and can make you start over levels if you run out of it.

Do well enough in the game and you unlock a topless mode, where the riders are all.. well.. 

There's also a 'create-a-ride' mode, and a two player split screen option, with different games of its own. The game plays on Acclaim's own Dave Mirra series' engine.</desc>

The nunchuck can also be used to control the facial expressions in Strike-a-pose sequences, but is not required. For karaoke, Boogie includes a USB microphone. Each song can be played as a dance or a karaoke game. Players either match the rhythm and pitch, or match the song's beats to dance. Variation and combos are encouraged, as too many similar moves will lower the score. By performing well in the dances, a Boogie meter is filled. When full the player can execute a special move. While dancing, bonus items appear such as multipliers, tokens and meter boosts. 
 
The game features a story mode centered around an intergalactic singing and dancing competition. There are five different characters, each with a unique story. For all other modes of play, players can create custom avatars based upon the five base characters, with a chapter in the story mode for each of them. Token collected during gameplay can be traded in for new songs, stages and outfits. There is also a mode where players can manipulate the camera to record their own music videos.</desc>

		<desc>Buffy and the crew are back for another battle against evil. On this occasion (set as a 'missing episode' from the TV series' fifth season), the powerful vampire Kakistos and The First are ready for war, and the only ones standing in their way is Buffy the Vampire Slayer and her friends Willow (an at times powerful witch), Faith (a fellow Slayer), Spike (former evil vampire turned slightly good) and Xander (caught in the middle of his best friends work). 
 
You get the chance to play as each character during the game as you slay vampires, solve puzzles and collect items along the way to prepare you for the final showdown. Various other characters from the show appear to help you out, while some are out to hurt you big time. 
 
Multiplayer options are also included for up to 4 players. Go rabbit hunting in Bunny Catch; be the last person standing against wave after wave of vamps in Survival or battle for control of the arena in Domination.</desc>

		<name>Burnout</name>
		<desc>Burnout is a arcade style racing game in the mold of the Test Drive or Need For Speed series. In this game, you are racing on realistic streets with real traffic to contend with. 
 
There are 6 courses on which to race, 3 of which are reminiscent of Europe, and 3 from the USA. There are several vehicles to choose from, ranging from compact cars to pickups. However, they are not based on real makes and models. 
 
One notable feature of Burnout is the "Burn Meter." The Burn Meter is a gauge that is filled by performing reckless stunts, like racing into oncoming traffic, or power-drifting through corners. Once the Burn Meter is filled, your car gets a super speed boost.</desc>

		<name>Burnout 2 : Point of Impact</name>
		<desc>Burnout is a street racing game focused around speed and crashing. Unlike many games which focus on closed course driving, you get to drive through cities with real traffic and city infrastructure. Designers have built an entire city and surrounding areas, and implement the race courses throughput the countie's streets. As a result, many times certain parts of race-courses interlace with other parts of other races. As well, instead of encouraging strategic driving and safe driving, Burnout strongly encourages offensive driving. Driving on the wrong side of the road, barely missing passing traffic, drifting, and jumps all add to your boost "burnout" meter. Speed boosts and jumps aid your attempt to dive past buses, trucks and anything else that gets in the way. The more offensive and dangerous your driving is, the more boost you get!</desc>

Burnout Dominator is the second spin-off game in the Burnout series and sixth overall. It retains the core gameplay of the series, as players race at top speeds through dozens of World Tour events testing "reckless skill-based" driving techniques. The versions for each platform do not interact with each other. 
This is the only Burnout game that was not developed by Criterion Games, and the first Burnout game in the series since Burnout 2: Point of Impact to not feature the "Crash Mode". At the time Dominator was being developed, Criterion was busy working on Burnout Paradise and was waiting to re-introduce the mode in a new form for the latter title. However, Criterion Games are listed as "the makers of this game" in the game manual and credited as developer on the official Electronic Arts site.</desc>

		<desc>After winning 2003 PC "Game of the Year" awards from a number of magazines and online publications, the World War II-themed first-person shooter Call of Duty seeks its Finest Hour in this 2004 console version. As in the home computer original, PlayStation 2 players experience the game through three different campaigns, which have them taking the roles of an American, British, and Russian soldier in turn. 
 Each campaign is designed to offer a distinct perspective, as the player's characters and their squad mates participate in historically inspired battles across four different continents. The Call of Duty series is noted for its historical accuracy and cross-cultural perspectives, its interactive environments, and its cinematically styled approach to story-telling. The PC original was developed by Infinity Ward, a team comprising several designers who had worked on the successful Medal of Honor series. The Finest Hour console versions of Call of Duty are the first games from developer Spark Unlimited.</desc>

The story is divided into four campaigns. The first takes place at the beginning of the war in the South Pacific as the player takes control of Pvt. Joe Miller serving with the American 2nd Marine Division as they start out in basic training in North Carolina. This level lets the player learn the controls of the game and then fastforwards to the Guadalcanal (as though the training mission was a flashback) where the player must survive with his company.  There are four more missions, two on the island of Betio and two on the island of Saipan.</desc>

Thirty-six protagonists from such titles as Shadow Hearts, Growlanser, Gungrave, and Generation of Chaos have united against a common threat. Players will assemble a party of heroes to engage in turn-based battles against a variety of monsters. A key feature in Chaos Wars is the ability to freely move characters within a circular area instead of a fixed number of squares or spaces, as is typical of the genre. A menu display lets players issue commands to attack, cast magic, or use items until the battle is won.</desc>

You can play training games (with all the hints and analysis tools available), rated games (your rating changes after each play), puzzles (chess ones, not the "build the picture" type), learn chess by browsing through the hundreds of tutorials available in the Pandolfini's Chess School or watch famous games. 
 
There are, however, some new features in the PS2 version; the most useful one is the Online mode. Other is the "living world" of the Chessmaster Championships, where the AI's rating changes, too, as they play each other. The last one is more spectacular - a  fantasy-themed - orcs vs. humans - game mode with animated chess sets and a 3D environment. You get to play chess in a forest, inside a castle and in the desert.</desc>

There's over 200 different body styles to unlock through the story mode (very few of them actually change the way your ChoroQ handles or performs; they're largely for show) and a wide range of parts you can buy to upgrade your car (either for performance or for looks).

There are 40 missions strung together with a narrative, depicting the Operation Overlord (D-Day), Bastogne, Operation Market Garden and the Battle of the Bulge and beyond - ending in an fictional effort to stop the Nazis from creating an atomic bomb. During a mission, you find medical packs, ammunition (weapon specific), and new weapons as pickups lying around, or dropped by enemies killed - the drops disappear if not picked up in time. A mission takes place on a series of relatively small maps, separated into 'levels', and at the level transition points the player can save the game, and is also awarded skill points, new ranks and medals.</desc>

If the mission requires it, you must drive tanks and jeeps around while your squad mans the guns on the vehicle. There is also the ability to play up to four player co-op with friends, with each person controlling a soldier in your squad. 
 
At the end of each mission, if you performed well, your men are awarded medals for their bravery. If you work hard enough, you may even be able to earn the Medal of Honor. 
 
The game features a Co-Op Campaign for 2 players.</desc>

		<name>Conflict: Global Terror</name>
		<desc>This installment of the Conflict series occurs in many diverse regions of the World: in Conflict: Global Terror, Red Team spends the game fighting international terrorism. 
 
Rather than gung-ho desert tank warfare, or tense jungle ambush fighting, the game explores many non-army locations such as gas factories, cocaine production facilities and hotels. 
 
The combat is often up close and very personal, although most levels seem to mix up the killzone areas giving a wide variety that support combat over many varying ranges. The Missions vary quite a bit too. Some are frenetic - fast paced where the team are fighting for their lives, others can be played at a much slower pace if desired. The level design really adds to counter-terrorism gameplay. The Team are often busting seiges using C4 to blow holes in walls and smoke grenades to flush the bad guys out.</desc>

		<name>Constantine</name>
		<desc>John Constantine is the name of the main character in the Hellblazer comic by Vertigo DC. This game is based on the movie Constantine, starring Keanu Reeves. The player assumes the role of Constantine, a mage/exorcist/demonslayer of the modern age. A man who fights Evil, but remains cynical and skeptical in the face of Good. He also smokes a lot. 
 
The game is played in third person perspective, switching to first person when the hero enters narrow spaces. Constantine's goal is to discover how and why Demons have managed to physically enter Earth, although the ancient laws forbid it. He utilizes a number of holy weapons and artifacts, from twin revolvers (dubbed the Witch's Curse) that shoot stones from the Holy Lands to Holy Water Bombs and the Cross Shotgun. Constantine can also utilize various kinds of offensive magic powered by the souls of slain demons. Often he will be obliged to travel to Hell, which resembles a perpetually ablaze and decaying version of our world, in order to bypass obstacles. Each level is linear and is played sequentially, following most of the story of the movie with a few sections added in or stretched out to allow for more action. Hidden cards in levels will unlock cutscene animatics, concept art, and interviews with the stars of the film.</desc>

		<desc>Crash: Mind over Mutant continues the storyline of its predecessor, Crash of the Titans.  
 
The Titans from the previous game has broken free from Dr. Cortex' control and has settled down on various places on the Wumpa Islands. But Cortex has teamed up with Nitrus Brio to develop a device which can control both the bandicoots and the Titans. Now Crash and his friends must find out where Cortex is hiding and stop him before he can act out his devious plan.  
 
Crash can use a light-powered attack to defeat smaller enemies, but for bigger enemies, a more high-powered attack is needed. Crash can also block and dodge attacks. Just like in Crash of the Titans, Crash can take control of the Titans which he encounters. But this time he can take the Titans with him and use them when he needs it. As Crash defeats more and more enemies, he can upgrade both his own attacks and the attacks of the Titans in his possession. 
 
The Co-Op Experience: 
Your co-op partner is Crash's sister, Coco, playable for the first time in the cooperative mode. Not only does Coco make the game more inviting to pick up and play, she also brings with her a new tactile "treasure hunt" ability where one co-op partner can "jack" on the other and ride as gunner, using different ammo.</desc>

		<desc>Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex is the first Crash Bandicoot game for a system other than the original PlayStation. The story is set some time after Warped: Dr. Cortex wants revenge after being defeated by Crash (again). For this purpose, he creates Crunch, a super-bandicoot who can destroy everything that crosses his way. So Crash needs to defeat Crunch (and in the end, Dr. Cortex). 
 
The game is a typical jump and run, with some other action passages, like air combat and a sequence where Crash is trapped inside a giant sphere rolling around in some sort of rollercoaster. All graphics are in 3D, and the sound is typical for cartoon games like this. The whole game is pretty straightforward in design, getting stuck on a puzzle is not really possible.</desc>

		<desc>Culdcept is a hybrid board/card game where the objective is to generate the most mana before making it back to the castle. 
 
Each player starts out with a deck of 50 cards. Card types range from monster cards (e.g. Skeleton), which are used to accumulate territory on the board to increase your mana; Equipment (e.g. Chain Mail), which will boost your monsters' abilities when they battle; and Magic (e.g. Holy Word 0), which can be used to help you or hinder the other players on the board. When a player lands on another player's monster, he/she can challenge it to a battle in an attempt to take over the territory. If the attacker wins, he/she gets the space on the board and additional mana.</desc>

In addition to the visual enhancements, which include 3D backgrounds, music videos, and dancers, the game adds EyeToy support, online functionality, and an ability to transfer data to and from the arcade title.</desc>

		<name>Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova 2</name>
		<desc>Slightly varied in technology and musical content from the Japanese arcade game and home port of the same name as well as the parallel European release Dancing Stage SuperNova 2, this game delivers rhythmic play that has become well-established over the course of the series' dynasty -- to gloss generally, players are rated on how effectively they deliver input in response to a continuously-scrolling list of controller direction instructions.  When the screen tells players that they're about to be called upon to hit the "left" button as its corresponding glyph ascends up the screen, they must try to match it precisely at the moment of the glyph's overlap with a target area at the top of the screen.  DDR games being what they are, this is all synchronized to player-selected electro-pop music with music video or animated dancing avatar sideshows, and of course is intended for play with the series' trademark control device, a giant four-way directional pad laid on the floor to be rhythmically walked upon.  (Two can be used simultaneously for two players or one who boasts some simply spectacular dance moves.)</desc>

		<name>Dark Angel : Vampire Apocalypse</name>
		<desc>Promising over 100 hours of gameplay, Dark Angel: Vampire Apocalypse is one of the longest adventures on the PlayStation 2. Set in the year 1640, players assume the role of Anna, the Dark Angel of Retribution. Though he was defeated a century ago, the monsters and demons faithful to the Shadow Lord have begun preparations for his resurrection. Anna has exactly one year to prepare for the battle with this demonic entity, and in this time she must explore three distinct villages and six unique battlegrounds, slaying all the creatures she comes across. An action-RPG that borrows elements from the likes of Diablo, Dark Angel: Vampire Apocalypse presents players with a wide array of equipment and an arsenal of weapons -- both, projectile-based and melee-oriented -- to collect.  
 
Weapons are bound to the controller's four face buttons, allowing players to combine items as desired. The requisite meters allow you to monitor health, spirit, and experience levels as well as your current stash of gold. Spanning three separate races, the hordes of monsters all succumb to different weapons you have at your disposal. Broadswords for example, are particularly effective against the Undead. The storyline is purposely non-existent, with nothing in the way of cut-scenes, and minimal character interaction to reveal more of the plot. Players are free to do as the please with little in terms of specific objectives to complete. You simply have to build Anna's abilities for the duration of a year, and ensure that she will be strong enough when the time comes for her to face the Shadow Lord.</desc>

You are in John's shoes as he must face a new threat. Piet Gruber, the son of Hans Gruber and McClane's old enemy, is up to no good at the Townsend Art Museum. He has stolen valuable art and kidnapped John's now adult daughter and fellow CCPD police officer, Lucy. 
 
This game is a First Person Shooter, but it also adds two features: Stealth Mode and Hero Time. Stealth Mode allows John to sneak around quietly, even being able to grab his foes and use them as hostages. This means it may not be best to go in guns blazing, when they could be arrested. Hero Time allows John to react far more quickly, just like Bullet Time in Max Payne. Hero Time is earned by saving hostages and performing heroic tasks in the game. 
 
There are several different weapons available in the game, ranging from a paintball gun for training to a sniper rifle. Most of the guns can also be used dual for the ultimate killing spree.</desc>

		<name>Disaster Report</name>
		<desc>Keith Miyamoto is a reporter who works for an important newspaper in Los Angeles. In 2005, he travels to an island called Capital City, where he has to get a new job. However, on his way from the airport to the city, a terrible earthquake occurs. The train collapses and Keith finds himself abandoned by the rescue team. Now he has to escape the island, try to save the people stranded on it, and discover the true reasons behind the chaos in the city. But that will be anything but easy. The earthquake continues, and any time Keith steps on a half-collapsed bridge, crawls over a pile of rumble, or climbs a narrow path between ruined houses, the Earth can start trembling... 
 
Disaster Report is a combination of pure adventure and survival horror genres. Controls, inventory management, fixed camera angles and relative vulnerability of the protagonist are reminiscent of Alone in the Dark and similar games, while the complete lack of enemies to fight reminds of a classic adventure. There are many ways to preserve Keith from constant dying. You can find items and combine them into new ones (for example, finding a helmet and a lamp will allow you to build a helmet with a flashlight attached to it). Keith will also need to quench his thirst, so you'll have to find water for him. The water taps found in the game also serve as save points.</desc>

"Sulley" Sullivan through 8 levels based on environments from the movie, including the scream factory, the streets of Monstropolis, Sulley's apartment, the Himalayas, and more. In each level, the main goals might include picking up one or more special items, or simply finding the exit. Sulley has to make his way across platforms, ladders and conveyor belts by jumping, climbing, flipping switches and pushing crates around. Enemies are rare, but Sulley can take them out with a whack of his tail, which is also used to break crates that contain items. There are also stealth sections, where Sulley has to avoid being seen by another character. Since the game is intended for younger players, there is no limit to the retries to any level, and helpful hints are always available. 
 
Each level also includes a number of collectibles and special tasks. There are 100 discarded screams to pick up - finding a certain percentage of them unlocks mini-game bonus levels. There are also 5 scream canisters to find and a small challenge involving scaring 5 mice within a time limit. If both are completed, clips from the movie are unlocked.</desc>

The dog elements are closely integrated into the game - smells are indicated by lines of coloured smoke, emphasising a dog's acute sense of smell. Locating footprints is also done via this Smellovision mode. Tricks can be learnt, and used to win treats from humans. 
 
Jake must explore vast environments and interact with 15 breeds of dog. The aim is to get them onto his side, which is usually done by either having more bones than them, or winning a subgame against them. These are also dog-based - in one you must dig up bones, while another has you 'marking territory' to annex a full screen.</desc>

		<name>Dokapon Kingdom</name>
		<desc>In Dokapon Kingdom monsters have attacked and pillaged the kingdom of its riches. For the adventurer who returns the kingdom's wealth, his majesty offers the honor of his daughter's hand, and therefore the title of future king. This doesn't mean, however, that you aren't permitted to play as a female character. You simply receive an altered ending in this instance. 
 
Three different modes are available: Story Mode, Normal Mode, and Shopping Race. You then create your character and begin play, the mode you choose having an affect on the overall goal to be achieved. The Story Mode is the standard play through of the plot, Normal Mode lets you generate certain factors of play ahead of time, like starting level, and go from there, etc. There are 3 started classes (warrior, chief and magician) and through levelling eventually 11 become available. 
 
While having a board game scenario with a spinner that allows the player to move over a game board, this is very much a light role-playing game as it has basic jobs, a battle system, and upgrades. Landing on a spot can trigger a battle, advance the story or introduce a mini-game. It is a 2-player game at all times (with another character controlled by the computer), but up to 4 people can participate.</desc>

Through the efforts of those games' hero, Kite, the incident resulted in the birth of Aura, the ultimate artificial intelligence (AI), capable of making decisions for itself. Under the guidance of Aura, The World, the most popular massively multiplayer online role-playing game at the time, flourishes and the events of .hack//Legend of the Twilight occur during this four-year period</desc>

		<name>Dot Hack G.U. Vol. 2 : Reminisce</name>
		<desc>The second release in a series of three, .hack//G.U.: Vol. 2 -- Reminisce takes place in a fictional MMO environment called The World. As in previous releases of .hack, The World features elements of online gaming without the actual connection. Gamers interact with people they might find in a real MMO, take on quests, and adventure across a large environment as they increase their level.  
 
In this version of The World, gamers find the once-utopian landscape is now a player killer's (PKers) heaven. A bug in the game is blocking the log-off ability to all fictional gamers; effectively locking them into The World. Now, bands of PKers prey on every character in their path hoping that the slaughter knocks them out of the game and back into real life.  
 
Gamers take the role of Haseo, a killer of players who is stuck in the game. Haseo must work his way through The World by interacting with other character, defeating enemies in dungeon sprawls, and by completing assigned objectives. Navigation through the game requires the use of Warp points located around the map.</desc>

		<desc>It is 2017 and the dangers found in .hack//G.U.: Vol. 3 Redemption are filtering out of the game. The evil entity terrorizing players in "The World" is free and wreaking havoc in real-life. Players once again take the role of Haseo, a young adventurer who is the only hope for restoring peace in "The World."  
 
Gamers lead Haseo through many recognizable environments and into such new root towns as Breg Epona and the Net Slum. The steam bike makes a return and players can now upgrade their bikes and speed through five riding missions. Toward the end of the game, players may access a 100 floor dungeon and work through each level with their most powerful party members.  
 
Haseo has earned a few upgrades via a mysterious hacker who broke into his account and added a new set of powers. These powers, called the "Xth" form, allow Haseo to use a pair of pistols with blades on the barrel. With these weapons Haseo can deal greater damage and perform a "double trigger" attack by invoking a special ability.  
 
The level cap is increased to 150, and gamers can add up to 22 additional avatars to their party. In the heat of battle, if players find themselves at the losing end, they can access the "avatar awakening" power and drain the virus cores from the enemy. Additionally, there are new cards for the "Crimson Versus" game and a new arena battle.</desc>

The story continues after the events of the first game. Kite's friend is still in a coma and he still hasn't found out why. The story deepens as the hacker Helba and the game administrators both start getting involved with Kite. The admins are not happy with him but can use his help to investigate what is going on. The question on what happened to Aura at the end of the first game still gets deeper and new elements concerning the beta version of ?The World?

		<desc>Dragon Quest V: Tenk? no Hanayome is a remake of the earlier game of the same name. It retains the story and the basic gameplay of the original version, while including a significant graphical overhaul and new gameplay features. 
 
The remake has fully 3D graphics with rotatable camera. The player is able to physically interact with many objects in the environment: for example, lifting and breaking a pot to reveal an item is graphically displayed, rather than being indicated by a text message. The music has been re-recorded with a life orchestra, as opposed to the synthesized tracks of the original version. 
 
The player can now have four active controllable party members instead of three. The amount of monsters who can join the party has been increased as well. Some mini-games are added to those that already existed in the original version. A trinkets museum has been added, which rewards the player for collecting local specialties from various places. 
 
Once the player finishes the game, he gains access to an additional dungeon with powerful enemies. A demo disc for  Dragon Quest VIII is included.</desc>

		<name>Dragon's Lair 3D : Special Edition</name>
		<desc>The goofy, but courageous knight Dirk the Daring is on a quest to save the pretty princess Daphne. The princess was kidnapped by the evil dragon Singe and imprisoned in a medieval castle owned by an even more evil wizard called Mordroc. Now, it's only up to Dirk to use his courage and his quick reflexes to overcome the traps in the castle, if he wants to save the princess and his skin. 
 
Dragon's Lair 3D: Special Edition can be considered a re-imagining of the 1983 arcade game: gameplay-wise it deviates from it significantly, being a full-fledged action platformer with unrestricted character movement. Dirk has to battle enemies, jump across platforms and hazards, and solve a few puzzles on his way. Health and mana points can be upgraded over the course of the game. Dirk can also use a crossbow to combat enemies and solve some of the puzzles. Collecting Dragon Essences scattered through the castle grants him new powers. 
 
The game features the familiar cartoon-like style of the original version (done with cel-shaded technique), as well as many familiar locations and boss enemies.</desc>

		<name>DreamWorks Monsters vs. Aliens</name>
		<desc>Monsters vs. Aliens is based on the animated movie of the same name. During the course of the game the player takes control over three characters from the movie which all feature different gameplay elements. Missing Link, a mix between fish and human, has to survive levels which are similar to most licensed games from animated movies: a 3rd person platformer.  
 
The sections with B.o.B., a slime monster, are more puzzle oriented. He can swallow enemies or items and use them to spit on other enemies. These are also used to press switches and as safety procedure when crossing bars - if B.o.B. had nothing solid in him he would just slip through them. With B.o.B. the player also has to solve mazes and shooting sequences. The last character is Gigantika, a 15 meters high woman. She uses trucks as inline skates and has to avoid obstacles by jumping or mastering quick time events (pressing a displayed button in a limited time). 
 
In co-op mode the second player takes the role of a Dr. Cockroach and supports the main player with appropriate actions, e.g. shooting. The player can unlock a lot of bonus material, e.g. concept art, deleted scenes (in this case: levels) or audio commentaries.</desc>

But there is another globally operating group: A massively militarised drug syndicate. When an attack on a peace convoy in Columbia is linked to this cartel, the UPF starts investigation. A central base and training camp of the drug cartel is believed to be located somewhere in Libya. The UPF opens up a base in this country and starts looking for the criminals. 
 
The player is a recently recruited soldier and pilot of the UPF. During the campaign, which lasts for 20 rather long missions, he can travel and fight on foot, in tanks and various other ground vehicles, but most of the time he will be piloting a dropship, either of the attack, defender or transport class. Dropships can operate in hover and flight mode, and carry a large amount of weapons and cargo.</desc>

		<name>Dynasty Warriors 3</name>
		<desc>About 1800 years ago in China, there were three fearless warriors battling for ultimate control over the country. One who sought hegemony. One who sought ambition. One who stood up for righteousness. Veterans who shared the same swarmed under each leader. These stalwart souls waged war across the vast expanse of the land and, like blood thirsty demons, cut down any and all who stood in their way. 
 They followed their own rules, they were both revered and feared by millions... they are the Dynasty Warriors. 
 Dynasty Warriors 3 takes place over the 50 years of war recounted in Romance of the Three Kingdoms, from the first flames of battle in the Yellow Turban Rebellion to the final battle between Wei and Shu on the plains of Wu Zhong. Over 40 characters are playable, both from the three main sides as well as leaders of lesser armies along the way. Each character that belongs to either Wu, Wei, or Shu has their own series of levels where they will turn the tide of battle for their force to win.</desc>

		<name>Dynasty Warriors 3 : Xtreme Legends</name>
		<desc>Dynasty Warriors 3: Xtreme Legends is a stand-alone expansion to Dynasty Warriors 3. In both games, you take control of a military general in ancient China, each with their own unique abilities and weapons. 
 
The gameplay is simple: you destroy hoards of differently ranked enemies on an open battlefield. Your objective in most missions is to defeat one or more enemy generals. Each character you choose has a different storyline (this story mode is referred to as "Musou Mode"), with seven battles progressing the story along. Battles get harder as you move along in the story. There is also a free mode, which allows you to play any level that you have unlocked with any general that you have unlocked (you start the game with three generals from three different dynasties). 
 
The difference between Xtreme Legends and the original Dynasty Warriors 3 is that in Xtreme Legends, the Musou Mode only features seven unaligned generals that you couldn't play as in the original.  There are also challenge modes in Xtreme Legends not featured in the original. And there is a more advanced bodyguard system allowing you to name them, customize their advancement, and choose from more weapons you unlock as you play through the game.</desc>

The Empire mode adds a strategy overlay to the basic game, with a map of 25 areas to conquer. Each turn consists of two parts: empire control, and war making. Your territories bring you tax revenue each turn, which you can spend on various different actions. You can create items and tactics for your generals to use in battle. Recruit generals and troops, fortify your territories, among many other command options. You can wage war on other territories, or may be called upon to defend your own. For each battle you select which generals and lieutenants will fight. There are 4 scenarios to unlock, though they offer little to differentiate each other. 
 
There is two player split-screen co-op, in either of Empire of Free play modes. Next to the soundtrack of the base game, this edition also adds soundtracks from previous titles, including Dynasty Warriors 2, Dynasty Warriors 3 and Dynasty Warriors 4.</desc>

		<desc>Dynasty Warriors 5: Xtreme Legends is a minor expansion to Dynasty Warriors 5. This game was released on November 16, 2005 and is playable only on the PlayStation 2 video game console. 
 
Dynasty Warriors 5: Xtreme Legends does not allow the player to play Musou Mode or Free Mode if the player does not possess the original Dynasty Warriors 5 game disk. New game modes included Destiny Mode, Xtreme Mode, and Legend Mode. 
 
Xtreme Mode is a parallel to Shura Mode in Dynasty Warriors 5 Special, in which the objective of the game is for the human-controlled character to survive as long as possible while collecting gold dropped by enemies to regain health and increase stats temporarily. 
 
In Destiny Mode, the player is first allowed to customize a character. After creating a personalized character, a player will be asked to join the Kingdom of Shu, Wei and Wu. While in this mode, you will be playing as a character with very few attacks (starting off with only 2 fundamental hits) and will be "protected" by a chosen officer near the character. The officer will heal the character continuously when injured during battle, so long as the character is nearby. A unique feature of Destiny Mode is that at times the player is given the option to betray one force, while setting a ruse for another. For example, a player receives a letter from Cao Cao, the King of Wei, in which he asks the player to defect from the Kingdom of Wu to the Kingdom of Wei. If the player defers the offer to switch sides their commander may approach them in the hopes of creating a ruse to destroy the opposing force. If the player chooses to accept the option from their commander they will fight for the other side temporarily. When the time is right their original commander will have them move the opposing commander to a set position which will trigger their ruse and supporting units will ambush the opposing commander to support the player's defection.</desc>

		<name>Dynasty Warriors 6</name>
		<desc>Veteran publisher Koei draws more inspiration from Chinese literature's Romance of the Three Kingdoms for its sixth installment of Dynasty Warriors. As with previous titles in the action-oriented series, players choose from a variety of stout heroes and noble warriors before engaging in historically inspired battles featuring hundreds of combatants. While the series has been criticized for its lack of significant changes from release to release, Dynasty Warriors 6 adds a number of enhancements to the well-traveled franchise. Though it lacks the graphical flourishes of the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions, the PS2 edition of Dynasty Warriors 6 offers ten new scenarios, five additional stages, and host of new weapons. The emphasis is still on defeating throngs of enemies with swords, giant hammers, polearms, and other weapons, with lengthy combo chains possible by varying attacks. 
 
As players become more skilled in combat, they can choose from a variety of skills to customize their heroes as they see fit. A new "renbu" system allows characters to earn immediate combat bonuses through dexterous play, but these bonuses are lost once the battle is over. Characters also have the ability to swim across water and scale walls to perform surprise attacks on enemy camps. Another change is the omission of bodyguards, so players must go it alone instead of having a personal entourage. In their place is a faithful steed that can be called upon in a pinch to make hasty retreats or to charge at full gallop into groups. The character's horse will also level up along with characters, improving attributes in speed or power in combat. Featured game types include Musou Mode, a character-specific campaign, Challenge Mode, offering specific goals to complete, and Free, which involves building a character's stats on any unlocked battlefield. Players can also team-up with a friend via split-screen display.</desc>

		<desc>Egg Mania is a puzzle game in which the player controls an egg shaped character against either a computer opponent or another player via the link cable. The object of the main modes is to build a tower tall enough to reach a balloon at the top of the play field before the opponent does. If the player tries to take a short cut and not build complete floors, the structure will start crumbling and the water will come up faster. There are plenty of obstacles, both from the game and from competing opponents. Falling meteors can knock the player down into the water, while bombs thrown by the opponent will destroy parts of the player's structure. The main modes include Over Easy and Hard Boiled, the difference being that in the latter a different difficulty can be chosen.</desc>

		<desc>The story begins with Niobe, captain of the Logos, and Ghost, her first mate, retrieving a package left in the Matrix by the crew of the recently destroyed rebel ship Osiris. After being pursued by Agents, Ghost and Niobe escape from the Matrix with the package. 
 
The package is a message to the human city Zion, warning them that the machines are tunneling to Zion with an army of Sentinels. Niobe and Ghost are tasked with calling the rest of the ships back to Zion to coordinate a defense. During this operation, Niobe and Ghost provide backup to another group of operatives trying to escape. 
 
With everyone home, the captains of the various ships hold a meeting in the Matrix to decide on how best to defend themselves. During the meeting, Agents attack the building they are in. Niobe and Ghost help the humans escape; when everyone is safe except them, the Keymaker, a program capable of accessing any area in the Matrix, leads them to safety through a door that he created. 
 
The Keymaker gives the two a key that they are supposed to give to Neo, the protagonist of the film trilogy. However, the key is stolen by henchmen of the Merovingian, a program created during the early days of the Matrix who now is a crime boss in the Matrix. As Niobe and Ghost pursue them, the character that the player did not choose is captured by more henchmen. Before the player character rescues the one captured, the Merovingian destroys the key that the Keymaker gave them. They then escape from the Matrix.</desc>

But soon he discovers that the groom Xelpherpolis has put an awful time-looping spell on the island, and intends to destroy this way the entire population. Mouse has to stop the villain and, most importantly, recruit other people to help him break the spell. 
 
Ephemeral Fantasia is a Japanese-style role-playing game with turn-based combat. Several characters can be recruited to the party. The game's stand-out feature is the time-looping system, which is somewhat similar to the one implemented in The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. The game has an internal clock, and the first five days repeat themselves until Mouse finds a way to stop it. Certain events occur only if Mouse travels to a specific location at a specific time.</desc>

Gamers begin as a semi-skilled hero who is upgraded as the story progresses. 
 Players may execute attacks with arrows, swords, and magic. Using magic, Eragon can push or pull an enemy toward him or knock attackers off platforms. Eragon can also manipulate his environment by creating pathways to previously unreachable areas. During the adventure, players may call for help from Saphira, Eragon's dragon, to complete airborne objectives and deliver attacks from the sky during melee combat on the ground. In flight, players direct the movement of the dragon, delivering tail swipes and fireballs to opponents as Saphira.</desc>

But as they arrive on Melee Island, they notice some very strange changes. A mysterious stranger who calls himself Charles L. Charles is organizing a campaign to become the next governor. The Australian businessman Ozzie Mandrill is turning the Caribbean into an attraction for tourists. And on top of that, Elaine's mansion is being demolished! Naturally, it's up to our hero to revert the things back to normal, even if that means traveling to exotic islands and solving puzzles on the way. 
 
Escape From Monkey Island is a direct sequel to The Curse of Monkey island, and is the fourth game in the Monkey Island series. The gameplay relies mainly on inventory-based puzzles and branching dialogues, just like in the previous installments. The interface is similar to that of Grim Fandango: mouse is not used, and the interaction is done via context-sensitive commands that appear on the screen whenever you navigate Guybrush close to an object. The game utilizes pre-rendered backgrounds and 3D character models.</desc>

There are five different parties for gamers to control, and each party offers a unique branching storyline as players travel further into hostile territory. Gamers will confront hundreds of demons along the way, and each creature can be captured and exploited, either for money and new spells, or for added protection in later battles.

The city of Dearborn, MI, has been infested with Deadites and there's only one man alive who can clean them out. As the one-handed Ash, players can whack enemies with a shovel, shred them with a Gatling gun, rip into their bodies with a chainsaw, and make them chew lead with the boomstick, a 12-gauge double-barreled shotgun. Played from a third-person perspective, the game lets players use two weapons at once and features the wisecracking voice of Ash himself, Bruce Campbell. 
 Up to 50 enemies can appear on the screen at any given time, but Ash can call upon the Book of the Dead's dark magic whenever he's in a pinch. Magic is replenished by collecting the souls of Deadites, and spells are acquired by finding scrolls hidden throughout each stage. Levels also feature multiple objectives that could involve locating more weapons, meeting with a certain character, or finding a way inside a specific building. Items such as keys to buildings, health packs, and other tools needed to advance are automatically stored in inventory.</desc>

		<name>Evil Dead : Regeneration</name>
		<desc>Based on Sam Raimi's classically campy series of horror films that began with 1983's The Evil Dead, this action game follows the continuing, cursed adventures of Ashley J. "Ash" Williams. Ash was recently sentenced to the Sunny Meadows Institute for the Criminally Insane, after being falsely convicted of murdering his camping companions. When Ash's psychiatrist begins tampering with the Necronomicon -- an evil book of ancient magic that has been the recurring source of Ash's supernatural troubles -- all hell breaks loose (quite literally). 
 Once again, Ash is voiced by Bruce Campbell, who portrays the luckless hero in the films and previous Evil Dead games. Evil Dead: Regeneration plays like a combat adventure, in the fast-paced, fixed-camera style of the Devil May Cry or Onimusha games. Ash uses his "boomstick" shotgun and chainsaw prosthesis to blast and hack his way through nearly endless throngs of "deadites." Unlike earlier games based on the franchise, Evil Dead: Regeneration was developed by Cranky Pants Games, whose previous work includes the GameCube port of Volition's Red Faction II.</desc>

		<name>Family Feud</name>
		<desc>A simulation of the TV game show of the same name. Two families will compete against each other to choose the most common answers to questions such as "Things a jockey needs", or "Clothes that don't go on hangers". More than 1000 questions are included. 
 
The 2006 edition has both standard and quick games. The standard game contains 5 rounds. In rounds 1-4, two people are selected, one from each team, who compete to buzz in a common answer to the question on the board. The team that wins control then has to figure out the other common answers, earning a strike for any answers that are not common. If any common answers remain after that team's third strike, the other team has a chance to steal all the points for that round by guessing an unrevealed answer. In rounds 3 and 4, the stakes are higher. In round 5, two people from the winning team work together to find common answers to questions before time runs out. The quick game has just one family, who has to guess the common answers to a question. Finding all answers earns bonus points. 
 
The standard game can be played against the computer, another player on the same computer, or over the Internet. Answer questions by typing them out or using the on-screen keyboard; the computer will recognize word variations and some misspellings. A family editor is included, which lets you edit body type and clothing. By playing the game, new clothing options and studios will be unlocked.</desc>

As boorish blockhead Peter Griffin, players must stop English butler Mr. Belvedere's apparent bid for world domination. Wrathful wunderkind Stewie Griffin battles his "sperm brother" Bertram, while cultivated canine Brian Griffin figures a way out of prison. 
 The game features a cel-shaded look to keep it in line with the animated series, and players will visit a number of familiar locales in and around the fictitious setting of Quahog, Rhode Island. Expect characters such as Death, Glen Quagmire, Cleveland Brown, and Joe Swanson to make comical cameos throughout the "giggity giggity" game. 
 The Griffin family from Fox's animated TV series makes its way to video gaming for the first time.</desc>

		<name>Fighting Angels</name>
		<desc>Fighting Angels is a story-less 3D fighting game featuring an all-female cast. The game is a 1-on-1 fighting game with minor wrestling influences: players can freely move in all directions around the arena, the ropes surrounding the arena can be incorporated into the fighting, and there is ground-based grappling much like in wrestling. 
 
Each character has four attacks -- weak and strong punches and kicks -- which have three variations each. Besides normal attacks, there are so-called "Sexy Attack", which are weaker than normal attacks but are much flashier and will build the character's "Sexy Gauge". There are also "Plain Attack", which are more traditional but drain the Sexy Gauge. If a character's Sexy Gauge is full, they'll have a chance to use a super-powerful Sexy Combo Attack, which is often powerful enough to completely drain the opponent's health. It is also possible to block and use a basic grab move, as well as pick up objects around the arena to use as weapons. 
 
The game includes a number of different modes. The main single-player mode is tournament mode, in which the player chooses a character and tries to defeat each computer opponent in order. There is also a standard versus mode for one or two players, a survival mode, and a practice mode. As is the standard for Tamsoft's Simple 2000 sports games, there is also a view mode where the player can dress and of the characters in any unlocked outfit and watch their animations from any angle.</desc>

The Naz'Ha invaded the former corporate colony, massacring the colonists. With the their superior technology powered by the Lazari crystal, the Naz'Ha have annihilated four waves of Ecco's retaliatory attacks over the past six months.

		<name>Finny the Fish &amp; the Seven Waters</name>
		<desc>In this underwater action-adventure, players take the role of the title character: a small, freshwater fish who finds himself in a (number of) big ponds (not to mention streams, lakes, and rivers). At the beginning of the game, Finny learns from a wizened old turtle that a great destiny lays before him, and that he must leave the safety of his home and travel the wide waters to find it. With representations of over 100 different species of underwater life, the game is full of small bugs and fish for Finny to eat, and large fish and animals that are interested in eating Finny. Unpredictable currents, hidden bonus areas, and (especially) fisherman's lures all pose additional challenges the small fry protagonist must face. 
 In essence, the game is something of an arcade-style "fish sim," with believable underwater environments to explore and many action-oriented puzzles to solve. Some gameplay elements may be reminiscent of the later, 3D incarnations of Ecco the Dolphin, but Finny's adventures are presented in a slightly more "anime" (if not anthropomorphized) style. Originally known as Uo the Fish: The Seven Waters and the Gods, the North American release of Finny the Fish is the result of an unusual collaboration between eccentric publisher Natsume, the Sega staple design studio WOW Entertainment, and the PS2's own home team, Sony Computer Entertainment of Japan.</desc>

Every burning building contains luckless victims who scream and call out for help as our hero makes his way through flickering infernos to the rescue.

Apart from the usual race modes, you can also take on a 4 player race (split-screen only).</desc>

		<desc>Freedom Fighters offers a blend of strategy and action as players fight to reclaim New York City from Soviet invaders. After winning the Cold War, the Soviet Union launched a nuclear missile at Washington, D.C., killing the President. Soldiers then started flooding across Canadian and Mexican borders to establish control in each of the largest U.S. cities. 
 Cast in the role of Christopher Stone whose brother was kidnapped by the Red Army, players must solicit and then lead a group of ragtag freedom fighters to accomplish various objectives. From an underground base in the sewers, players plan out their missions using a turn-based system. Once on the streets, the action takes place in real-time as players fight using such weapons as machine guns, grenades, and Molotov Cocktails.</desc>

		<desc>Freestyle MetalX is, as the name implies, a motocross stunt game.  It contains 9 pro riders and twelve licensed bikes to begin with, plus some secret ones.  It is structured somewhat like the Tony Hawk series with a career mode that is a succession of levels, each one containing goals like doing specific tricks, finding gaps and finding things, which could take the form of breaking windows, running people over, etc.  In this case, there are also racing goals.  Each goal gives you money, which can be used to unlock new riders, bikes and levels. 
 
Controls consist of an accelerator, brake and clutch along with jump, trick and trick modifier buttons.  The modifier can be used to turn a superman into a nothing superman, for instance.  Wheelies are controlled with the right analog stick.</desc>

 While his friend Lumpy is away, Frogger learns from his girlfriend Lily that the evil crocodile Dr. Wani is threatening Firefly Swamp. He must save his home by solving puzzles, collecting gold coins and dodging hazards. 
 Frogger does have a few new tricks available to him, as well, such as the ability to climb walls and grab objects with his tongue. Players guide the intrepid amphibian hero through more that 30 levels, on a quest to save Firefly Swamp. In addition to this single-player story, a multiplayer version of the game is available, for up to four. True Frogger fans will also want to unlock an included emulation of the arcade game that started it all.</desc>

Having grown tired of life in Firefly Swamp, a bipedal Frogger sets out to find the girl of his dreams, who, in true fairy-tale tradition, just so happens to be a princess. With the hope that her kiss will be able to turn him into a prince, Frogger embarks on his perilous quest with the aid of his Fairy Frogmother, who grants him three gifts. Standing between the lovesick frog and eternal happiness is a cast of villainous characters and 20 levels of treacherous terrain ranging from desert wastelands to swampy towns.</desc>

		<name>Front Mission 5 : Scars of the War</name>
		<desc>Front Mission 5: Scars of the War is the fifth in Square's Front Mission tactical RPG series. It brings the player back to a gritty futuristic world in which conflicts are waged between five world powers: the U.S.N., O.C.U., E.C., O.A.C., and the Republic of Zaftra. Such conflicts are waged with the wanzer, Front Mission-speak for mecha. 
 
Gameplay-wise, the game is a true return to Front Mission 2 roots while incorporating various features from Front Mission 1, 3, and 4. The player takes part in turn-based missions, which pit their group of wanzers against enemy forces. Old features that have returned include the ability to upgrade parts and mission branching. New features to Front Mission 5 include friendly fire and the ability to recruit new pilots. 
 
Unlike the previous games which were fairly standalone, Front Mission 5 covers the time period from 2070 to 2121. In effect, it goes through conflicts seen in the previous games as the years pass by. Through the eyes of U.S.N. soldier/officer Walter Feng, the player experiences his story as he deals with the aforementioned conflicts. With the passing of time, he becomes witness to hidden truths and accounts. Eventually, Feng is drawn to the on-going war on terrorism and begins to search for the truth.</desc>

		<desc>Fugitive Hunter: War on Terror (released as America's 10 Most Wanted in Europe), is a first-person shooter game for the PlayStation 2 and PC. Developed by Black Ops Entertainment and released in 2004, it was critically panned due to its dated graphics and lackluster fighting-game style boss battles. The European and American versions differentiate slightly in level music and terrorist names with Saddam Hussein only being present in the European version. 
 
According to an unlockable documentary snippet included in-game, development began before the September 11th terrorist attacks. In the wake of the attacks and as development continued, Osama Bin Laden would become a more prominent character in the game, ultimately serving as the primary antagonist.</desc>

		<desc>In Full Spectrum Warrior, you take on the role of commander of two squads of the United States military, Alpha and Bravo, as you guide them in the fictional country of Zekistan on a mission to capture or kill the terrorist Al Afad. 
 
In the game, you don't directly control your troops. You don't take aim at a target and shoot, and you don't circle-strafe around enemies. Instead, you tell your squad what to do, and they'll do it. It's like a real-time strategy game. You can tell your two squads to do numerous things, such as hide behind a wall, take cover behind a car, lob a grenade, fire off a rocket, or attack a target. You will need to utilize both squads to be successful. For example, you can have Alpha squad hide behind a car and lay down covering fire at a target that you can't directly kill, giving Bravo squad cover so they may cross open terrain, and get into a position where they will be able to kill the enemy. 
 
The game takes place in one locations, a Middle Eastern country, that's split up into several areas. You'll have to make your way through parks, an airport, city streets, and even some buildings. Throughout the country are many terrorists, all of whom are trying to kill you. You have four members on each squad; the Team Leader, Automatic Rifleman, Grenadier and Rifleman. Each plays a unique role. 
 
Full Spectrum Warrior supports Xbox Live, where two players can play through the single player campaign. Instead of controlling both squads, one player controls Alpha while the other controls Bravo.</desc>

But this time they can call upon the assistance of the British elements of the Coalition Forces. 
 
Like in Full Spectrum Warrior you are the commander of two Fire Teams called Alpha and Bravo. But now you can brake down a Fire Team to a Buddy Team consisting of the Team Leader with the Automatic Rifleman and the Grenadier with the Rifleman. In some missions you also have now access to a Bradley Fighting Vehicle which you control just like you control a fire team. In some missions you'll also find tanks or APCs which your Fire Teams can enter and use.</desc>

 The second North American PS2 game based on the Fullmetal Alchemist anime series, Curse of the Crimson Elixir follows an original storyline designed to complement the television adventures of the two young Elric brothers. Edward is a precocious, maimed alchemist, and Alphonse's human soul resides in the shell of a hulking mechanical man. 
 As in Square-Enix's earlier Broken Angel, this game features cel-shaded graphics and 3D platform-style combat, for which players can use Edward's powers of transmutation to create new, effective weaponry.</desc>

 The two boys were maimed when performing a forbidden ritual to return their lost mother to life, and now they quest to find the powerful magic stone that can restore their own bodies. Combat occurs in real-time, though good strategy before a fight can make all the difference; Edward can use his powers to transmute ordinary objects into powerful weapons, and it's always good to be prepared in the unpredictable urban and interior environments the boys must traverse. 
 The game is based on a Japanese animated television series, which could be seen on the Cartoon Network's "Adult Swim" at the time of the game's release.</desc>

		<desc>Matt Groening's "other" animated series makes its video game debut as a third-person shooter that has players blasting their way across time in an effort to stop the entity known as Mom from taking over the universe. The game casts players in the role of Fry, Bender, Leela, or Dr. Zoidberg, with each character having his or her own distinct moves and weapons. In their quest to right a terrible wrong, players will run through futuristic New New York (in the year 3000), revisit "old" New York, confront Sun Priests in Sun City, attack swamp monsters and gators lurking in the Bogad Bayou, and zip across an asteroid belt to zap giant robotic monsters living in a junkyard of space relics. 
  
 
In addition to shooting enemies with their character's default weapon, players can perform basic moves such as jumping or climbing to reach new areas or to avoid potential hazards. Puzzle-solving aspects involve activating generators before using elevators on certain stages, and simply flipping the occasional switch or lever. Writers from the FOX television series created the game's story and dialogue, with design input offered by show creator Matt Groening himself. To maintain the vibrant yet simple look of the sci-fi series, the developers made use of a "toon-shading render engine" created specifically for the game. Actors from the original cast also provide the voice-overs for each of the main characters.</desc>

The player starts by choosing one of six car bodies. Later the other bodies can be purchased through the shop, along with other variants (bodies are purely cosmetic). Upgrading the player's vehicle is done by buying parts. Many of the parts are normal for racing games (engines, tires etc.) with some more specialized parts like wings or skis.

		<name>Gene Troopers</name>
		<desc>A long war has ended and the Galactic Empire has grown but it isn't stable. Rebel groups still fight the regime but with the invention of genetic transformation, a normal civilian can be transformed into a mindless, easy to command but strong fighting unit. These civilians weren't asked, they were forced to undergo the procedure. You play one of these civilians. First they took your daughter and then they came for you. But before the procedure was completed, you were rescued by the rebels. Now it's your turn to fight back. 
 
Gene Troopers is basically a shooter but it lets you build and upgrade your weapons with stuff you find lying around. You can also extract the genes of an enemy to upgrade your own. With these codes you can choose in which direction you want to go with your character. This means you can either choose to upgrade your stealth abilities or to devote them to becoming a fighter. 
 
The game takes you to 6 different planets including a jungle world. There are drivable vehicles and team members to help you with your task.</desc>

		<name>Get on da Mic</name>
		<desc>Get On Da Mic is a karaoke game based exclusively on Hip-Hop songs. Players have to sing along with the songs as a version plays sung by an amateur singer and the lyrics scroll along on the screen. The singer's voice is adapted based on the player's timing, pitch is not taken into account. The songs are not sung by the original performers, but re-recorded. Scoring is based on the overall timing of the words. The words do not have to be sung correctly. It also registers when random noises are made as long as the timing is correct. As it mostly consists of rap songs, there is a bar and spacing between the words to provide help with the lyrical flow, along with a moving color highlighting the words. Songs can be sung in three difficulty levels. When performing well, a meter is filled up until the rock the mic sequence is activated, adding snow to the location or money falling from the sky.</desc>

		<name>Ghost Master : The Gravenville Chronicles</name>
		<desc>Ghost Master: The Gravenville Chronicles is the console version of the PC game Ghost Master. In this strategy game, you become the scourge of humanity by managing haunting teams consisting of various ghosts. The levels, usually inspired by famous scenes from horror movies, require you to scare mortals and complete additional objectives such as freeing trapped ghosts. Deployed ghosts need to be bound to certain objects, called fetters, that match their type. 
 
By scaring humans, you collect plasm, the main resource in the game. Plasm can be used to recruit new ghosts, or expand their abilities. Rather than deploying a massive amount of creatures, the game rewards creative use of limited resources to haunt mortals in original ways. Each human has a believe meter. An important aspect is figuring out each human's weakness. As you exploit this, they become more susceptible to various phenomena and provide more plasm. Along the way, you will meet fierce resistance as ghostbreakers, priests and witches can detect and ban your ghosts. 
 
The game is not a direct port. Instead, Spiral House was contracted to modify the original codebase by Sick Puppies to make it more user-friendly for the consoles. This includes a complete overhaul of the interface to make commands easier to access, the introduction of battle elements - next to the regular missions - to speed up the game's pace, a more linear game structure, and a redesign of the control over ghosts. They now have less AI and there is more variety in the types, requiring you to tap wisely into the plasm pool to deploy the most adequate ghost for each situation.</desc>

Ghost Rider features locales from the 2007 film starring Nicholas Cage and a storyline penned by comic writers Garth Ennis and Jimmy Palmiotti.</desc>

As the game begins, an epic event is staged with Invictus as the gladiator. Invictus fights bravely, but he is killed by an unknown and possibly un-human creature.

Developed by Electronic Art's Los Angeles studios, the game has players taking the role of an MI6 agent working toward elite "00" license-to-kill status, who is dismissed for "reckless brutality." Seizing the opportunity to bring such a highly skilled and well-trained operative into his own organization, infamous Bond supervillian Auric Goldfinger welcomes the player's disenfranchised agent into his ranks. 
 Like its N64 forebear, the 128-bit version of GoldenEye is a first-person shooter with lots of opportunity for multiplayer action. Standard deathmatches and domination games are supported, as well as a "Tug of War" game that has teams competing to move a bomb across the map by flipping a series of switches. Four-player split-screen play is offered, and properly equipped PlayStation 2 and Xbox gamers can go online to find competitive multiplayer games for up to eight. Also like the original, Rogue Agent features a full single-player campaign as well.</desc>

		<name>Graffiti Kingdom</name>
		<desc>Gamers must draw on their own skill and creativity to defeat the evil that rules over Graffiti Kingdom. This PS2 game features the doodling elements introduced in 2003's Magic Pengel, but in a more expansive, less linear adventure. Players take the role of Prince Pixel of Canvass Kingdom, whose parents were whisked away when a mysterious evil force infiltrated the land. 
 Prince Pixel is in a pickle. His parents have been kidnapped by an evil demon, called...Demon! Pixel has to rely on the power of Graffiti and his pet dog Pastel to release his parents from peril. The story follows Pixel around 22 levels in which he does various tasks with the help of creatures made with his magic wand which has magical powers. 
 The prince sets out to find them, and restore the land to its former peaceful state, armed with a single, versatile tool. His magic wand allows him to change form, even taking on the look and powers of the enemies he meets. More importantly, perhaps, it also lets him draw new objects and bring them to life. Not only can his doodles bestow new offensive and defensive powers, but the objects he draws can be the key to reaching important hidden and isolated areas, which are spread out among the game's 20-plus 3D platform levels.</desc>

 Dirt has riders taking on a series of jumps along a dirt course, while Street involves performing tricks as players race through an obstacle-laden street. Vert takes place on a halfpipe, where the name of the game is to catch huge air and pull off stunts to impress the judges. Each rider can perform up to 1,500 tricks depending on the event, with the ultimate goal being to earn gold medals.</desc>

As with previous games in the series the game involves tournament-styled battles between characters using their special abilities and moves. However for GG Isuka the battles are 2-on-2 instead of 1-on-1, taking place in multi-plane arenas (similar to Fatal Fury) and requiring the players to switch orientation manually.

Added features include two new characters (only one playable), new backgrounds and game modes including the new "Boost" mode, which turns the game into a 2D side scrolling beat 'em up.</desc>

		<name>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</name>
		<desc>Following the story and settings of the concurrently released feature film, and inspired by the fourth novel in J.K. Rowling's wildly successful series, the video game version of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire puts players in control of the bespectacled boy wizard and his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. As the story goes, Harry is unexpectedly entered as one of Hogwarts' select representatives in the prestigious and dangerous Tri-Wizard Tournament, and much of Goblet of Fire's gameplay is based on events in the magical competition. 
 
 
 Players will be challenged with winding mazes, fire-breathing dragons, and duels against deadly rival wizards. While similar to earlier games in the Harry Potter series, Goblet of Fire boasts refined presentation and a more empowering control scheme, designed to give players an immediate, palpable sense the spells they cast. The game also introduces a cooperative mode to the series, allowing gamers to play together, as Harry and his friends, and accomplish goals through teamwork.</desc>

		<name>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</name>
		<desc>In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding worlds and Hogwarts is no longer the safe haven it once was. Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defenses and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information. Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different adversary as teenage hormones rage across the ramparts. Harry finds himself more and more drawn to Ginny, but so is Dean Thomas. And Lavender Brown has decided that Ron is the one for her, only she hadn't counted on Romilda Vane's chocolates! And then there's Hermione, simmering with jealously but determined not to show her feelings. As romance blossoms, one student remains aloof. He is determined to make his mark, albeit a dark one. Love is in the air, but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again. In the game, players will return to Hogwarts to help Harry survive a fraught sixth year. They will also have a chance to engage in exciting wizard duels, mix and brew magical ingredients in Potions class and take to the air to lead the Gryffindor Quidditch team to victory. Players may even get sidetracked by Ron's romantic entanglements as they journey towards a dramatic climax and discover the identity of the Half-Blood Prince.</desc>

		<desc>The most famous boy wizard's first-year adventure gets a next generation update as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone comes to PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Nintendo GameCube in this reissue of the title. The updated release features presentational enhancements designed to make use of the power of the 128-bit generation systems. The gameplay and story remain true to the initial release (which was designed for home computers and the original PlayStation): a third-person 3D action-adventure based on Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, the first novel in J.K. Rowling's explosively popular series. 
 Players take the role of the prodigious young magician as he begins his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, joined by other favorite characters such as Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and even Draco Malfoy. Harry Potter can explore the grounds at Hogwarts, spend time with Hagrid, and even join a quick game of quidditch. However as in the novel, Harry's special gifts are noticed not only by his instructors but by darker forces as well, and he may even come face-to-face with "You-Know-Who" himself before this adventure is over.</desc>

		<desc>Harvest Moon: A Wonderful Life expands on the farm simulation aspects of its predecessors by having players develop a "life" through marriage and raising a family. Farming in this GameCube version is further enhanced by having more animals to care for, more crops to harvest, and an option for players to create hybrid vegetables by combining the seeds of two different types. As in earlier titles in Natsume's Harvest Moon series, players are not confined to a rigid storyline or plot while advancing through the game. Players are free to do whatever they want in the effort to become successful in both business and in life. 
 
 This PS2 "Special Edition" of A Wonderful Life adds to the GameCube original by allowing players to earn the chance to play as either a boy or a girl, and by providing more potential spouses for courtship. It also allows players to continue to work and develop their farms, even after they've completed the main campaign. New features for the PS2 version include up to four wives to marry, to have a son or a daughter with a mini career path, new farming equipment such as the fertilizer machine, and a free play mode to continue playing when all the chapters have been completed.</desc>

		<path>./Hokuto no Ken - Shinpan no Sousousei Kengo Retsuden (J).gz</path>
		<name>Hokuto no Ken : Shinpan no Sososei : Kengo Retsuden</name>
		<desc>The game is based on the Fist of the North Star anime and manga of the 1980s.  
 
The game was developed by Arc System Works, which also created the Guilty Gear, Blazblue, and Sengoku Basara X games.  
Perhaps I just enjoy the gameplay of the Arc System Works too much, because I really enjoyed playing this Hokuto no Ken game, or maybe its just that Arc System really know how to make good fighting games. Yes, that is the reason why I like their titles so much.  
 
Graphics are great and what you expect from Arc System Works. The sprites are clean, crisp, and well animated. That goes for the characters in the foreground and all graphics of the backgrounds as well.  
 
The music is also great and typical of the development team.  
 
The gameplay is just like that found in Guilty Gear and Sengoku Basara X. It is extremely fast paced, combo driven, and deadly if mistakes are made. There are a couple of differences though.  
There are attack reversals like Baiken from GG has, but I think all the characters here has one attack reversal.  
The deathmove a.k.a. Fatal K.O. can be committed without having to unlock its usage with a touch of a button. In other words you can launch it without delay and while in a combo. But, it can only be launched when the 7 stars of your opponent's big dipper constellation has been totally depleted. There are also unblockable attacks, which keeps people from relying on blocking too much.  
 
The gameplay seems more sophisticated than in Guilty Gear or Sengoku Basara X,...and each character has a much higher ability of moves and actions than in both games...but that is a good thing because there are only 10 characters in the game. That is a very low number for a 2D sprite fighting game,...but each character is much, much deeper in abilities and very more distinct in their own moveset personality than in most other fighting games.  
 
Has arcade, vs cpu, vs 2p, history, and survival modes, plus, the options mode.</desc>

		<desc>The aim of the game is to go through five areas and dispose of the burglars while locking all the doors and windows to stop more getting in. The player is able to collect and use tools to close the entrances, and traps to catch the burglars. Unless the player locks all the entrances on the level, however, defeating a burglar simply means another takes his place. The game only saves the high scores and does not save game data.</desc>

There are a number of different courses, characters, clubs, and ball types to choose from.  New equipment can be purchased with experience points, which your characters earn by winning matches.  Better equipment will ease up the games difficulty a bit by providing greater accuracy, distance, and control. 
 
As an addition feature, the game has an international ranking system of sorts.  With a password from the game you can post your scores on a website, where you can see how you measure up against everyone else out there.</desc>

The WASD keys move you forward and back, left and right, and the mouse controls camera movement and some actions. Scrat has a few special moves as well, such as sniff, his spin attack, a double jump, a ground stomp (useful for breaking ice) and a roll attack. Much of the game consists of hunting down acorns and other special nuts for health renewal or for unlocking bonuses. There are a few mini-games within the game - you can play as Sid, zipping along an ice slide while avoiding obstacles; there's also penguin-bowling and a mini-game where you "shoot" at monkeys to regain a walnut that was whisked out from under your nose.</desc>

		<name>Impossible Mission</name>
		<desc>In six hours the evil Professor Elvin Atombender's nuclear missiles will launch and destroy strategic locations on the earth. Only one agent can infiltrate his secret base and undertake this Impossible Mission. 
 
The goal of Impossible Mission is to acquire nine passwords and bring these to Atombender's Control Room in time to shut down the rockets. Unfortunately these passcodes (contained on punch cards) have been broken into four pieces each, and each piece hidden in computers, furniture, and waste bins throughout the base. On top of that Atombender has an entire army of robots patrolling the base. If a robot touches or shocks the agent then ten minutes are removed from the clock and the room is reset. The agent can jump over robots, but the only way to stop them is to expend a specific item on a room's computer terminal, and even that only disables them for a few seconds.</desc>

		<name>In the Groove</name>
		<desc>In The Groove is a dancing game similar to the games in the Dance Dance Revolution series. Gameplay involves watching arrows scroll up on top of a music video and the player has to step on the corresponding arrows on the dance mat in time..Performing well will start a combo meter going up, but if the player misses to many the game will end. The unique aspect of the game is arrow modification. Arrows can be modified which can alter the difficulty with things such as no jumps, spinning, or increased speed making things easier or harder for the player.</desc>

Unlike the previous Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, the game is designed to be more action-oriented with hand-to-hand combat against martial artists and Nazis throughout the streets of Hong Kong and 1935 China. Objects in the environment can also be used as weapons, so Indy can clang heads with a shovel or knock foes back with a chair in addition to using his bullwhip and pistol.</desc>

		<name>Inuyasha : The Secret of the Cursed Mask</name>
		<desc>InuYasha comes to North American PlayStation 2 consoles in the form of this RPG. The animated series involves the story of a schoolgirl named Kagome, who falls down a well and is magically transported to feudal Japan, where she meets her rival/companion/love-interest Inuyasha, a dog-like half-demon boy. 
 Together, the two go on adventures to recover the scattered pieces of an ancient, shattered artifact. In The Secret of the Cursed Mask, players take the role of one of two new characters (created especially for the game by anime artist Rumiko Takahashi) who have been sent back in time just like Kagome. They'll make friends and enemies in the legendary lands of InuYasha, and these relationships will have great influence over their ultimate quest to return to the present-day world.</desc>

		<desc>Iridium Runners is a futuristic running game that pits competitors against each other on hazard-riddled race tracks in foot races. Players can choose one of 20 characters that have unique running skills and techniques. Some of the characters and tracks can only be unlocked as the game progresses.

All of the runners will do just about anything to win, so the action can become down and dirty. Almost anything goes during the races including knocking opponents completely off the track with a well-placed kick, fist or weapon. Power-ups and booster items are scattered around the course for increasing performance, speed or providing a new method of attack. Strategy comes into play by knowing which character and which "pod" sidekick to choose.

There are three modes of play: Single Race, Cup and Championship. Each offers unique environments, different obstacles and challenges.

The Single Player game will put the player up against 5 CPU opponents. Multiplayer is offline and includes Deathmatch and Team modes (2 players on 2 teams) and up to 4 players in split screen.</desc>

As in the speculative fiction action series on which the game is based (and which was dropped from Fox's Friday night lineup a season before the game's release), players enter a post-apocalyptic Seattle, WA, where high-tech science fiction gadgetry is juxtaposed with sordid, urban desperation. 
 Trusting few aside from her computer-genius companion Logan, Max must challenge the cruelly mercenary Manticore group to save other "super soldiers" who, like her, were engineered to be soulless, military machines. The action takes place through a variety of environments that will put Max's enhanced speed, strength, and agility to the test. Dark Angel features the voices of Jessica Alba and Michael Weatherly, the actors who portray Max and Logan on the television show.</desc>

If the question is correct, the player earns that amount of money; otherwise they lose it.  If they happen to select one of the rare Daily Doubles, the player instead wagers as much of their current earnings as they wish.

		<name>Jumper : Griffin's Story</name>
		<desc>Though timed to coincide with the motion picture of the same name, Jumper tells a story that intertwines with that of the film, but is ultimately different than that of its movie inspiration. The game centers on Griffin, a young man on a quest to avenge his parents' death who uses his spontaneous teleportation abilities to battle a group know as the Paladins. Jumper's heavy emphasis on combat lets players take advantage of Griffin's unique abilities to perform three different kinds of dynamic "jumps." The Combat Jump lets players instantaneously move around Paladins in the midst of a fight sequence, the Traversal Jump allows gamers to pick a spot in the environment and jump to it, and the Finishing Jump lets players move enemies to completely new locations.</desc>

Players sing using the Logitech PS2 Headset (or other approved PlayStation 2 USB microphone devices).  The game rates the player's performance based on their vocal pitch and timing.  A visual indicator shows the player's current pitch in real time and also the pitch of vocals of the original song.  If the original notes of the song are too high for the player's vocal range, the game allows the player to sing at higher or lower octaves to hit the correct notes.</desc>

The presumed era of world peace, however, is marred by continuous attacks carried out by a new terrorist group called "Heaven Smile", which consists of human mutants under the influence of a lethal virus, and targets the United Nations and the International Ethics Committee (IEC). Meanwhile, the relationship between the United States and Japan deteriorate, as the latter becomes controlled by a party that proposes to sever connections to the USA. 
 
 
 A group of assassins known as Killer7 is hired by a man named Christopher Mills, on behalf of the US government. The group is led by an elderly wheelchair-bound man named Harman Smith, endowed with an ability known as "Multifoliate Personae Phenomenon", which allows him to transform into seven different personalities who were professional assassins in their lives, and whose souls were absorbed by Harman after they were killed in a mysterious incident fifty years ago. Garcian Smith is the leading persona among these seven, and the only one who can communicate with Harman.</desc>

		<name>Kinetica</name>
		<desc>An original title from Sony Computer Entertainment, Kinetica is a high-speed futuristic racer akin to the likes of XG3 Extreme G Racing. In stark contrast to more conventional forms of racing, the racers in Kinetica wear futuristic suits with wheels attached to their hands and feet. As a result, the racers themselves become the vehicles. Far from a mere cosmetic choice, these suits play an integral part of the gameplay. Free from the hulking vehicles found in similar games, these racers can move their limbs independently, and as such, can perform a host of tricks and stunts. Players are required to execute these stunts by performing a combination of directional movements while holding the R1 button down. Correctly executing tricks fills a boost meter, which, once completed, provides the character with a limited speed boost. 
 The racers themselves come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and include both male and female competitors. During a race, competitors are randomly awarded power-ups, with a range of uses. Tracks are scattered across a handful of environments, dropping racers into inhospitable alien worlds, caverns, and the requisite futuristic cities. Shortcuts, jumps, and tight turns prevail throughout the tracks, requiring players to master a variety of handling techniques.</desc>

		<name>Kya : Dark Lineage</name>
		<desc>Kya and her brother Frank have been transported into a different dimension, and upon arriving are separated! Kya meets (and is saved by) the native creatures of this world (known as the Nativs), however Frank is captured by a dangerous enemy known as the Wolfens under the rule of Brazul. To make matters worse, Kya learns that the Wolfens are actually the peaceful Nativs which have been captured and transformed, and Brazul is actually her long lost father! Kya must now embark on a quest to rescue her brother as well as find a way to restore the Wolfen to their Nativ form and defeat Brazul. 
 
Kya: Dark Lineage is an action adventure game. You control Kya and need to explore the colorful world she's arrived in. This strange world consists of various floating islands with many tunnels, platforms, dangerous life forms, and other obstacles. Powerful winds blow around many areas, and you'll often need to use the winds to your advantage by floating in them through tunnels, over gaps or slowing your descent in a free fall. There is some puzzle solving as well; you'll need to locate objects to use, hop on various platforms, buy items in the Nativ city, and more to reach new areas. 
 
You'll also need to fight often, as the Wolfen are numerous and can found guarding many areas you need to get through. You can fight with your fists as well as items that can be acquired (such as various boomies, or boomerangs, and fighting bracelets). After defeating a Wolfen, you can use a magic spell to transform it back to its Nativ form which will then return back to the Nativ city. Upon returning to the city, many of the Nativs will then open up a shop; as new shops are opened, you will have the opportunity to buy new items and power ups to help on your quest. Alternatively, some Nativs may instead build a challenge in the city instead of opening a shop. You can earn money by betting and completing challenge objectives (or you can simply practice a challenge). 
 
As you progress through the game, the story will unfold until you are (hopefully) successful in your quest!</desc>

		<name>Lara Croft Tomb Raider : Anniversary</name>
		<desc>Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a remake of the original Tomb Raider. The remake has the same basic storyline, locations, and core gameplay; however, it has a technically more advanced graphics engine and adds several new features that were introduced in Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend. Lara has many new moves, such as swinging on ropes, bullet time when an animal rushes towards her, and the addition of a grappling hook in her inventory (which resembles the one from the original game). Jumping is also a lot easier, as the heroine automatically grabs the ledges without requiring pixel-precise timing. There are also completely new moves, where Lara balances and jumps on small sticks. 
 
The cutscenes are identical, but rendered in real-time using the new engine. Some are also action-based, like in the previous games, requiring quick reflexes to keep the action going. The environments and puzzles have been somewhat changed to fit the new gameplay, and the voice recording was also redone.</desc>

		<desc>Indeed a legend in her own time, Lara Croft returns to consoles in 2006 with a new look, a new game, and a new developer. Revamped physics and an enhanced control scheme allow for more free-flowing action, while graphical improvements present a redesigned Lara who is immediately expressive, more believably proportioned, and as strikingly attractive as ever. 
 Lady Croft's new look in Legend is based in part on 20-year-old British model Karima Adebibe. Lara now boasts smoother animations, a more realistic deportment, and a number of costume changes. The original Tomb Raider games were popular for their innovative blend of gaming styles as well as for their distinguished female lead, however, and this game is designed to return fans to the winning combination of 3D platforming, environmental puzzle-solving, and third-person shooting found in the blockbuster originals.</desc>

		<name>Lara Croft Tomb Raider : The Angel of Darkness</name>
		<desc>Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness has been billed as the first true renovation of the best-selling series since the ground-breaking 1996 original. This edition is built on a completely new engine, which pumps out "next-generation" graphics and allows many new animations and interactions. Lara herself enjoys the engine upgrade as well, as she's now rendered with ten times the number of polygons as in earlier Tomb Raider games. 
 The role-playing aspects of this adventure are slightly more central to play than in earlier games. Lara must enter a dark, supernatural world where nothing is certain. She must interact with other characters, and complex situations call for her to make ethical decisions where there is no clear-cut "good" or "evil" choice. Lara also develops throughout the game, as her abilities improve and adapt to the way she's played. A new system is designed to offer smoother control of Lara's many moves, which include new stealth attacks and hand-to-hand combat.</desc>

		<desc>A group of people known as Mystics live like outcasts, shunned by most humans because of their unique connection to the world of spirits: they are able to summon powerful supernatural beings called Origins. A small village of Nohl is a refuge for Mystics; one of them is a young swordsman named Lang, whose duty is to protect a crystal that supplies the town with water. One day, Lang meets a mysterious man who manipulates him into giving up the crystal. Determined to correct his mistake, Lang sets on a journey to retrieve the crystal, on which he will learn more of the role the Mystics and their Origins play in the world. 
 
Legaia 2: Duel Saga is a follow-up to Legend of Legaia, though it is not directly connected to it story-wise, featuring a different cast of characters. Like its predecessor, it is a Japanese-style role-playing game with turn-based combat. The game utilizes a system called "Arts", which requires the player to press a combination of buttons corresponding to fighting moves during battles. These are divided into the sub-categories "Normal Arts" (basic moves), "Hyper Arts" (more powerful moves that require special points to be spent), "Mystic Arts" (Origin powers), and, finally, "Variable Arts" (team attacks). 
 
The game also features a Camping mode; accessing it, the player is able to communicate with the characters in the party, prepare meals from ingredients, and craft items such as weapons, armor, and accessories.</desc>

The young hero "Kay", a cat, rise to a challenge when emperor Shun - king of the mighty gorilla - invaded the island Yenching with his troops. Kay may be only a scholar, but he is a brave and agile fighter. He leaves his village only with his sword and soon becomes a seasoned fighter. 
 
The fights in Legend of Kay reminds of good old eastern martial-arts-movies. There are various moves the player can execute: uppercuts, back flips, somersaults, powerful magic attacks and you have the combo moves. When you gain a combo, you can auto aim at enemies, which makes it easy for the player to execute double- and triple blows. 
 
In the beginning you only have a sword but later in the game Kay receives steel claws and a powerful war hammer. All weapons can be upgraded. 
 
Kay has to fight against a lot of different enemies on ground and in the air. There are a lot of jump and run action, puzzles and of course many, many fights.</desc>

As the best fighter in the Dragon Dojo, Ling prepares herself to become the next Golden Dragon, but is severely disappointed when her brother, Ang is chosen instead. Consumed by raging fury, Ling is easily persuaded to join with the evil Zodiac Master. She changes her name to Shadow Dragon and vows revenge as she tries to collect and control the 12 Zodiac bracelets. 
 To gain possession of the armlets, one must visit each of the guarded temples housing the magic jewelry and defeat the guardian waiting there. Each bracelet features an image also found in the Ancient Chinese Zodiac, and whoever holds the bangles acquires the power to transform into the animal engraved on each manacle. Legend of the Dragon features eight modes of play and three multiplayer options, including "PlayQuest," "Arcade," "Training," "Survival," and more.

The player explores a LEGO-based environment in an open world format: ride a skateboard, drive, fly and pilot a range of vehicles all whilst performing stunts and tricks while taking on the bad guy, Brickster. The player is cast as Pepper Roni, a lead stuntman in a big movie production set on LEGO Island. 
 
Even though the player is free to go wherever he wants, there is a story behind the game divided over 25 missions. All the missions are stunt-based. Running around the world in 3rd-person view, the controls are pretty basic and do not offer the trick combinations of other stunt/trick-based games. It is easy to pick up and play, even for the younger players, without worrying too much about what button combination will do what trick. Instead the player can focus on the missions by only having to complete basic tricks with a few button presses. 
 
During the quests players can collect trading cards to unlock mini-games. Other features include bricks to create "Brickimals" and the ability to change LEGO Island objects.</desc>

 Sporting a shiny new graphics engine, new power ups and a great car and driver builder, Lego Rac ers 2 promises racing adventure in true LEGO style. The drivers and racers look and react more like real LEGOs than ever before--in a crash, they break into individual LEGO bricks.

		<name>LEGO Star Wars : The Video Game</name>
		<desc>This curious blend of big-name brands tells the earlier parts of the Star Wars story in a version of films' universe that's been built from scratch with Lego parts and people. The game highlights the action of Episodes I through III (the more recent, prequel films); players take control of thoroughly Lego versions of heroes such as Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Princess Amidala, Anakin Skywalker, and others, to battle through action-oriented levels based on the films' settings, but constructed entirely with Lego blocks. 
 
 Different characters have different special skills, and this leads to some exploration and puzzle-solving gameplay along with the 3D platform-style action and combat. As they progress, heroes earn credits which can be spent to unlock new characters. The main game features unlimited lives, encouraging players to explore the secrets hidden in each area. LEGO Star Wars was developed by Traveller's Tales, a studio previously known for its handling of licensed properties in games such as A Bug's Life, Finding Nemo, The Weakest Link, and Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex.</desc>

		<name>LEGO Star Wars II : The Original Trilogy</name>
		<desc>The surprise hit of 2005 returns for more brick-blasting battles and sci-fi spoofing in LEGO Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy. As the title suggests, the storyline focuses on the first three films in the Star Wars saga. Players will choose from a variety of LEGOized characters as they attempt to end the Galactic Empire's tyrannical reign. The lighthearted action is still designed for players of all ages and abilities, but there is now more to see and do. New character-specific special moves are available, from Leia's head-knocking slaps to Obi-Wan's helmet-spinning use of the Force to confuse his attackers. 
 
 As players progress through familiar movie scenes in the story mode, they can unlock more than 50 characters and even mix-and-match individual parts and accessories to create custom hybrids for use in the "free play" mode. Also new is the ability to build vehicles such as landspeeders, AT-STs, and speeder bikes, or to ride creatures like tauntauns and banthas. The original's cooperative play option returns with a revamped camera and more team-oriented challenges to overcome. As a special bonus, owners of the first game can unlock 54 additional characters for free play, expanding the roster to include Darth Maul and other fan favorites.</desc>

		<desc>Computer gaming's luckless lounge lizard, Larry Laffer, has retired his leisure suit, put away his martini glass, and is out of the romance game for good. His nephew, however, still has a glimmer of hope. The follow-up to Sierra's long-running graphic adventure series makes its PS2 debut courtesy of developer High Voltage Software, best known for games in the Hunter: The Reckoning series. Players take control of Larry Lovage, who not only has his uncle's receding hairline, but also his distinct talent for getting slapped whenever he's around women. 
 
 In an attempt to jumpstart his humdrum life, Larry decides to participate in a reality-dating program being taped at his community college. Inspired by the humor in such films as American Pie and There's Something About Mary, the game will have players experiencing a number of risqu? and lewd plot twists through 20 levels of adventuring. Though it follows the same style of puzzles found in the first seven games in the series, players are free to explore the college campus in full 3D from a perspective set behind the stumbling seducer as he meets up with a variety of offbeat characters in his search for true love.</desc>

		<name>Magic Pengel : The Quest for Color</name>
		<desc>Magic Pengel is centered on the player, as a character able to manipulate a "Pengel" (which looks like a stylized fairy combined with a paintbrush) to create a creature, or "Doodle". Using the Pengel (pronounced "pen-jell") as a cursor, the player simply sketches out the limbs, body, and other features. Depending on the amount of magic ink expended, and the types of body parts, the creature will be given certain statistics and created. With the help of Zoe and Taro, the character trains and battles using custom-created designs, which can be traded to or battled with the creations of other players. As the Doodles battle, they become more powerful, and earn points towards the purchase of pre-created Doodles, and extra abilities towards customizable creation. Combat functions according to three selections: attack, magic, and block, as well as a charge command. The three basic maneuvers follow a standard rock-paper-scissors methodology, but repetitiveness is minimized due to the varied attributes of the Doodles, as well as the inability to successively repeat any selection.</desc>

		<desc>Makai Kingdom is the fourth Nippon Ichi-developed tactical RPG on PlayStation 2 and it follows closely in the footsteps of the previous games of the same style, which are Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, La Pucelle: Tactics and Phantom Brave. 
 
Lord Zetta, the king of Netherworld, tried to rewrite the history of the land but didn't succeed, and in the process brought demise onto himself. Three evil Overlords appeared before Zetta and promised to help him in his quest to take over the land once more. The player takes control of Zetta and his army to return Netherworld to its rightful owner. 
 
The game mechanics consist of several stages in which the player must defeat the enemy or fulfill other tasks to advance to the next level. Fighting is done in turns, meaning that once the player has moved and attacked, it's the enemy's turn to move his troops one by one. When the battle is won, the next level becomes selectable. Between fights, you can improve your squad of fighters by buying better weapons, recruiting more soldiers and so on.</desc>

		<desc>Capcom's three-on-three arcade game, featuring popular characters from previous action, shooting, and fighting titles, comes to the PS2 with this release of Marvel vs. Capcom 2. Over 50 characters are available to fight as or against, two-dozen of which are initially playable. Each combatant offers a variety of aerial maneuvers, special attacks, and projectile blasts as players attempt to defeat their opponent's team. 
 Rather than having all three characters fight on the screen at once, players swap fighters in and out of the match at any time, even for a single attack on an opponent. The remaining two characters rest on the sidelines until called upon to assist. In addition to a health bar, each fighter has a separate meter used for Hyper Combo attacks that can be powered-up to five increasingly destructive levels. 
 Besides directly switching characters during a fight, players can press one of two assist buttons to have one of their teammates perform a pre-selected attack or defensive maneuver. If an opponent has unleashed an aerial attack, for example, pressing the assist button might have the second or third character enter the screen to perform an anti-air maneuver, thus leaving the primary fighter free from harm.</desc>

Joe then shoots down more planes and also aids the USS Nevada (BB-36) to escape the harbor. Joe is then sent to the Philippines to destroy a bridge, and he meets his brother Donnie. Donnie is unable to escape the islands because his tank was overwhelmed by Japanese troops, forcing Joe to leave without him. Joe then goes to Guadalcanal at night to take over an airbase. Days later, the airfield is still taking heavy artillery fire, so Gunny assigns Joe and two other marines to destroy the artillery nicknamed 'Pistol Pete'.

Similar to Medal of Honor: Airborne, during certain missions players parachute onto the battlefield and can choose from which starting location to complete the mission. There is no vehicle-based gameplay in this version. 
 
Alongside the single-player campaign there is also 5 split-screen multiplayer mode for up to 4 players: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, King of the Hill and Scavenger Hunt. No online gameplay is supported.</desc>

		<name>Metal Saga</name>
		<desc>A follow-up to the Metal Max games, Metal Saga is set in the same post-apocalyptic world as its predecessors - a world populated by bounty hunters, rangers, bandits, and mutant monsters. You take the role of a bounty hunter who has to travel the world, looking for "wanted" people. Accompanied by a soldier, a mechanic, and a cyborg dog, the hero must survive a journey west that will ultimately take him to remote places and lead him to battles against evil. 
 
Metal Saga has a less linear story line that one would normally expect from a Japanese RPG - a story line that develops according to the missions you decide to take, which in their turn lead to new events and finally to different endings. The combat system features traditional party management and turn-based battles, with the addition of Metal Max's trademark tank combat. When you acquire tanks for your characters, you can use them in battles. Tanks get damaged and broken, but you will be able to customize them by finding parts scattered across the world and assembling them to build new models. Based on the model of tank many different kinds of weapons, cannons, and accessories can be equipped to it, making for hundreds of different options. Tanks can even be given a custom paint job that is saved to the memory card.</desc>

Just like in Mad Tracks you drive little toy cars through 50 miniature-size all-day environments like over a pool table or through the eaves gutters of a house. On the tracks you can find weapons (e.g. a flamethrower, a monster-hammer or rockets) and power-ups that help you win the race. If you win a race you'll get money which you need to unlock new tracks and cars. 
 
In multiplayer mode up to 4 players can race against each other either on one PC or online. The PS2 version offers multiplayer with multitap and with the PSP version, you can play on one device (two players) or through WiFi (four players). Playing online also features a new twist in the races. If you want to, you can bet your car and if you lose your opponent gets it. You can also trade cars from your collection with others. 
 
An editor to design your own tracks is included in the package. Extra tracks can be unlocked by connecting the PSP to the PS2.</desc>

Several years after the One Year War, the A.E.U.G. is formed from a group of disillusioned members of the Earth Federation and is now waging war against the Titans and it is up to the remaining members of the EF to team up with the Titans to stop this menace. 
 
The story revolves around a Gundam pilot named Kamille Bidan, who pilots the game's namesake the Zeta Gundam, but the player can also choose which side they want to fight for, either the Titans/Federation or the A.E.U.G.  The gameplay mostly consists of traversing landscapes and destroying enemy mechs and completing objectives.  The mechs can also convert into secondary vehicles such as jets with more powerful weapons as well.</desc>

		<name>Mobile Suit Gundam : Journey to Jaburo</name>
		<desc>Mobile Suit Gundam follows the exploits of Amuro Ray and his friends and colleagues aboard the White Base, a flying fortress that serves as their home, as they engage in various missions against the Principality of Zeon. Half a century has passed since the world's population began migrating to massive orbiting space colonies. All is not well, however, as a group of colonies furthest from the planet proclaims itself the Principality of Zeon and declares war on Earth. 
 Half of the warring factions' populations have been destroyed and there appears to be no end in sight to this war between the Earth Federation and the Principality. An innocent civilian by the name of Amuro Ray is drawn into the conflict, and it's this young man, more specifically, his Gundam, that players control. Based upon the anime, gameplay in Mobile Suit Gundam is reminiscent of Armored Core 2, requiring players to pilot the robot-like Gundam through a number of missions ranging from guerilla attacks on enemy installations to defending a base against an onslaught of invaders.</desc>

The game features a new 3D engine to support the familiar combination of weapon and hand-to-hand combat, but moves are now based on real-life martial arts styles, such as Crane, Snake, Tai Chi, Tae Kwon Do, Muay Thai, Tang Soo Doo, and more. Fighting styles can be switched at any time during a match, and the damage a character receives will be visible on his or her face, body, clothing, or movements. 
 
 
 
 Returning characters from the best-selling series include Scorpion, Sub-Zero, Cyrax, Jax, Raiden, Sonya, Kitana, Shang Tsung, Quan Chi, and Reptile. Characters making their debut in Deadly Alliance include a female counterpart for Sub-Zero, a blind samurai, and a masked tribal warrior. Arenas take place in fully 3D environments, fraught with spiked pits, pools of acid, and other deadly hazards. New special moves and gruesome fatalities will also be included as the franchise makes its debut on the next-generation systems.</desc>

You start with the host of the show, Xzibit, lending you his car, and you must go out into in a five borough area called 'Pimp City'. At this point, you can take part in various mini games throughout Pimp City in order to earn money and buy your own car, and then pimp it. 
 
While pimping your ride, Pimp My Ride's host Xzibit will be on hand to help you. Once you have completed your car's pimping out, you can take your new looking ride out for a spin into Pimp City, essentially turning the game into a free roaming racer, and earn money and complete various challenges and races in order to progress through the game.</desc>

		<desc>Myst III: Exile is the third title in the Myst series of graphic adventure puzzle video games. While the preceding games in the series, Myst and Riven, were produced by Cyan Worlds and published by BrÃ¸derbund, Exile was developed by Presto Studios and published by Ubisoft. The game was released on four compact discs for both Mac OS and Microsoft Windows on May 8, 2001; versions for the Xbox and PlayStation 2 were released in late 2002. 
 
As in previous games, the player assumes the role of the Stranger, a friend of Atrus. A member of the D'ni race, Atrus can create links to other worlds called Ages by writing descriptive books. In Exile, Atrus has written an Age for the D'ni to live on while rebuilding their civilization; it is stolen, however, by a mysterious figure. The Stranger pursues the thief in an attempt to reclaim Atrus' book. 
 
The creators of the Myst franchise gave the task of creating the third Myst game to Presto Studios, known for its adventure game series The Journeyman Project. Presto sought to develop a diverse and logical approach to puzzles and Ages, and worked to make the villain sympathetically multifaceted.</desc>

It is a fighting game with cel-shaded graphics resembling figures straight out of the manga. Ultimate Ninja contains twelve characters from the show, each with their own unique movesets and special attacks. In the overseas versions, two more bonus characters were added: Curse Mark Sasuke and Nine-Tailed Naruto. These were already playable in the Japanese version as a stronger mode for the regular characters, but split off into separate characters for the other versions. As such, the base characters cannot transform into these variations in the versions released outside of Japan. 
 
The characters can fight in several locations seen in the show and comics, such as Hidden Leaf Village, the Chunin Exam arena, and the Forest of Death. There is a main story mode with six battles and dialogue between the characters.</desc>

		<desc>Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja 4 is the first game in the series that moves into the Shippuden storyline. The newly added "Master Mode" tells an original story that takes place during Naruto's journey with Jiraiya and is centered around a demon named Black Shadow who demands human sacrifices from a nearby village. After this is resolved the mode continues with Shippuden's regular Kazekage story arc. 
 
The "Master Mode" features a small but open game world for the player to explore. Naruto can collect items, fight enemies and talk to people in order to progress. However, the actual fighting remains to be the core of the Ultimate Ninja experience and was more refined and expanded in Ultimate Ninja 4. When two opponents clash, they will begin a series of high-speed attacks, appearing as a pair of blurs flashing across the stage. The winner is determined by a game similar to that of Rock, Paper, Scissors. There is also the addition of "Awakening Jutsu", a technique that is more powerful than the standard Ultimate Jutsu and, as the name implies, "awakens" a character's hidden powers and can only be used when certain conditions are met.</desc>

One of the new gameplay additions is the introduction of assist characters. Assist characters are chosen during character selection, and can be called in during a match to deal extra damage. Certain combinations of characters create unique jutsus in a match; these combinations reflect the associations of those characters in the anime and manga. Many of the character's jutsus from the previous game were updated. There are many updated ultimate jutsus, including the aforementioned assist-specific ones. Summons have been removed from the game. The assist characters cannot be turned off. The game retains the RPG mode from previous game, now allowing the player to control characters other than Naruto (such as Sakura and Kakashi). However, the Hero's History mode that retells the events of the original series have been discarded, though the characters itself remain in the game. It was also the last of the Ultimate Ninja Series for the PlayStation 2. The game was not released in North America.</desc>

		<name>Need for Speed : Carbon</name>
		<desc>The gameplay is based upon rival street racing crews. Players run a crew and can hire specific street racers to be in their crew and the active friendly racer is known as a wingman. Each hirable street racer has two skills, one which is a racing skill (scout, blocker, and drafter) and a non-race skill (fixer, mechanic, and fabricator). Each skill has different properties from finding hidden alleys/back streets (shortcuts) to reducing police attention. Cars driven by the wingmen are also different; blockers drive muscles, drafters drive exotics and scouts drive tuners (although the first two unlockable wingmen (Neville and Sal) drive cars according to the player's chosen car class at the start of the game). In career mode, players have to race tracks and win to conquer territories and face off against bosses to conquer districts.</desc>

		<name>Need for Speed : Hot Pursuit 2</name>
		<desc>The Need for Speed series returns, this time reverting back to the 'chase' arcade experience instead of a racing simulation. Top speed racing is the name of the game, where you must outchase not just the opposing drivers, but the cops. 
 
Choose from a selection of today's (and yesterday's) top sports cars, including the Ferrari F50, Porsche 911 and a range from the likes of Ford, Corvette, BMW, Lotus, Mercedes, Aston Martin, the McLaren F1 and a lot more. 
 
The competitive race mode allows you to take on other drivers and beat them to the line. A selection of tracks allows you to not only dodge incoming traffic, but perform deadly jumps and stunts to receive points. These points, combined with the points recieved from your finishing position, can unlock new cars and tracks. 
 
The Hot Pursuit mode combines all the major elements of the competitive mode with the chance to out run the cops. They will throw everything at you to try and stop you, including running you off the road, setting up road blocks and unleashing an attack helicopter equiped with missiles. Three busts by the cops ends the race.</desc>

		<name>Need for Speed : Most Wanted</name>
		<desc>The player arrives in Rockport City, driving a racing version of the BMW M3 GTR (E46). Following Mia Townsend (played by Josie Maran), the player proves his driving prowess as he is pursued by a veteran police officer named Sergeant Cross (played by Dean McKenzie), who vows to take down the player and end street racing in Rockport. 
Races seem to be in the player's favor until a particular group of racers, led by the game's antagonist, Clarence "Razor" Callahan (played by Derek Hamilton), sabotages and win the player's car in a race. 
 
Without a car to escape in, the player is arrested by Cross, but is later released due to lack of evidence. Mia picks up the player and then informs the player about Razor's new status on the Blacklist, a group of 15 drivers most wanted by the Rockport Police Department. She then helps by assisting the player in acquiring a new car and working his way up the Blacklist. Rivals are defeated one by one, and the player is rewarded with reputation, new rides, and ride improvements with every Blacklist member taken down.  
As new boroughs are opened up throughout Rockport (Rosewood, Camden Beach, and Downtown Rockport), Mia also sets up safehouses for the player to lie low in, in exchange for placement of "side bets" on the player's races.</desc>

		<name>Need for Speed : Undercover</name>
		<desc>Need for Speed Undercover has players racing through speedways, dodging cops and chasing rivals as they go deep undercover to take down an International crime syndicate. The game heralds the return of high-intensity police chases and introduces the all-new 'Heroic Driving Engine' -- a unique technology that generates incredible high-performance moves at 180 miles per hour during breathtaking highway battles. A mix of computer graphics and live-action movies immerses gamers in the rich world of the Tri-City Bay Area. The cityâ€™s open-world environment features over 80 miles of roads, including an enormous highway system that sets the stage for highway battles. These high-speed, high-stake chase sequences push players to the limit as they fight off cops and opponents while whipping through traffic at 180 miles per hour. An intelligent new A.I. mechanic delivers a realistic and high-energy action driving experience. Going back to the franchiseâ€™s roots, Need for Speed Undercover features more aggressive and intelligent cops whose sole purpose is to take down the player quickly and by any means necessary. Need for Speed Undercover also features the series' signature car customization, real-world damage and realistic driving physics. The game includes some of the hottest licensed cars such as the Audi R8, BMW M6 and Lexus IS-F.</desc>

The prologue begins with the player driving in a Nissan Skyline R34 in Olympic City (though the racing scenes are actually in Bayview), the setting of NFS:UG. He then receives a race challenge from a rather ominous personality who offers him a spot on his crew, but "won't take 'no' for an answer." The player races off â€” despite Samantha's warnings â€” only to be ambushed by a mysterious driver in a rage that totals his Skyline. The driver, who has a unique scythe tattoo, makes a call confirming the accident, and the flashback fades out.</desc>

		<desc>The Nakatomi company is searching for the pieces of the Akujiki sword, shattered by Hotsuma in the predecessor, Shinobi. Luckily, the Oboro ninja clan has since reformed. As Hibana, kunoichi (female ninja) of the Oboro clan, you are charged with the task of finding the pieces of the Akujiki before Nakatomi does. 
 As a rift reopens between this world and the realms of evil, the svelte and stealthy Hibana must battle demons from beyond to save the people of Tokyo. The heroine's ninja skills are matched with a deep understanding of the mystic arts, making her the last, best hope to keep the city safe and the evil contained. 
 While Nightshade's gameplay is similar to that of Sega's 2002 version of Shinobi (also developed by OverWorks), the kunoichi Hibana may perform a number of new special attacks never known to her male counterpart. Shadow dancing, she defeats powerful foes with flashy finesse. An enhanced "Tate" system allows unlimited combos, and filling her "Chakra Gauge" allows Hibana to perform powerful ninja magic.</desc>

		<desc>When city bear Boog is led into the forest by a mule deer named Elliot, it becomes Open Season for any unlucky hunters who happen to cross the bears path. Raised by Beth the park ranger, Boog is not used to living in the wild, and must tap into his instinctual abilities to make it back to Beth's garage in one piece. Players will guide Boog and Elliot through the forest using their environment to scare hunters away before they make a rug out of Boog's domesticated hide. 
 Players may throw skunk bombs, hurl rabbits, enlist squirrels to fire acorns at their foes, and perform many other pranks that will have the hunters headed for the hills. Gamers can play alone or challenge friends to compete or cooperate in a variety of mini-games such as rolling in a giant snowball, riding rapids on a floating outhouse, taking a nice leisurely mine cart ride, and more.</desc>

		<desc>The fourth installment in Koei's P.T.O. series brings strategic naval combat to the PS2.  There are two levels of play: global strategy and resource management are handled with a turn-based system on a world map while individual battles are fought using a real-time system on a much smaller scale. 
 
The campaign can be played as the Americans, British, Japanese, or Germans, starting either in September 1939 or December 1941.  If a players chooses to be American or Japanese with a 1939 start date, they will sit on the sidelines and watch the war until December 1941, but they will still be able to gather resources and spend them to build units or develop technologies.  Players can also concoct "what-if" scenarios by changing which countries belong to which powers: for example, one could play an Alliance of America and Germany against an Axis of Japan and Great Britain, or even play three-on-one for more of a challenge.</desc>

While clumsily making their way through Pac-Land, the four ghosts inadvertently plucked magical golden fruit from a tree in the center of Pac-Village. This awakened a dark creature named Spooky, who orders the ghosts to hide the fruit throughout the land. Thus begins a quest to regain the golden fruit across six multi-staged areas: Forest, Tree Tops, Snow Mountain, Lava, Ocean, and Ghost Island.</desc>

 Gameplay comes in two styles: In control of the ambitious hero Jack Driscoll, players fight for their own survival from a first-person perspective; while in the empowering role of the mighty Kong himself, players have a third-person perspective that allows them to take in their surroundings, and take better control the massive ape in battle. Developed in conjunction with Jackson and his production company, the game also features scenes and locations not seen in the film.</desc>

In the beginning, Arvin talks to the player about the "Magic Hat". The Magic Hat is the hat that has been passed down their family tree for generations. The main purpose of the Magic Hat is to protect the world of cats from evildoers who want to destroy it. The animal wearing the Magic Hat will gain amazing power. The power to do anything. 
 
 
 
If used by the wrong animal (evildoers), then the user will eventually become nothing but pure evil. Ok, back to the story. Arvin has just received this from the player's (kitten's) grandfather in the game, and tells the player about how important the Magic Hat is, and why it should never be used for evil, and only good, and the vow he made to use it only for good. Then, Ione says we seem to have a visitor. Then, the player's friend, Victor, comes over to play outside.</desc>

The intrepid adventurer is brought to life for more than 50 perilous levels set in such exotic South American locales as rainforests, glaciers, mines, and ancient ruins. As in the original, players must utilize Harry's athletic prowess to swing from vines, run from rolling logs, hop over treacherous pits, avoid snapping crocodiles, and more, while trying to survive the hostile environment. 
 
His objectives? To retrieve lost artifacts before they fall into the hands of his rival and to save those in danger. Pitfall Harry will eventually encounter situations that even he can't conquer with a well-timed jump or two, so players can pull items stored in his knapsack to assist him. Like the character's single foray on the original PlayStation, this game is designed to make players smile while exploring the mysterious lands before them. Although Pitfall 3D made use of Bruce Campbell's voice for its comic effect, Pitfall Harry attempts to use its visuals to elicit grins, with the protagonist drawn as a caricature, with a large head balanced atop a slender body. 
 
 
As the story begins, Harry is a member of a treasure-hunting expedition whose plane goes down in the forest. The other survivors are scattered throughout the game; an older, wiser adventurer who was on the plane -- and who becomes incapacitated during the accident -- urges Harry to embark on a quest to save them while battling a rival, eco-unfriendly group of treasure hunters for the relics of the jungle so they can be returned to their rightful owners. He hands Harry the "Hero's Handbook" and Harry's off to adventure. The "Hero's Handbook's" pages are scattered throughout the levels just like the crash survivors are. Find new pages, and Harry will learn new moves.</desc>

Civilization as you know it has collapsed and now you must make your way out of the city while staying dry and warm in a metropolis that now resembles Atlantis. Gamers may take the role of six different people and play through several different storylines as they progress through the game. Each person is influenced by the actions of another. For example, if you place supplies and clothes in a locker the next character you play can find and use those items. 
 The enemy in the game is hypothermia and water. If you remain in wet clothes and out of shelter for too long your body temperature drops and you die. To combat the cold you can locate such items as dry clothes and space heaters throughout the city while you search for a way out.</desc>

Players will control a revamped Rayman who wears outlandish outfits from different eras, including a purple afro and ?70s-style threads, to further enhance his powers. 
 In the fourth Rayman game of the main series, Rabbids invade the earth and lock up Rayman in a prison inside a coliseum. He is forced to take part in more than 75 mini-games, called trials. Rayman will get to throw cows, milk cows, make Rabbids dance - even race warthogs and eagles... all for the amusement of the Rabbids. After winning games, Rayman will earn plungers which can be used to construct a ladder to escape from the jail cell. After completing three trials in the coliseum, a boss game must be completed; such as an on-rails first person shooter, or a racing game.</desc>

Sopot originally created the Red Faction soldiers using a form of nano technology but, fearing they would fight back, ordered them to be destroyed. 
 
As the leader of the group, your task is to take back freedom that was lost, and save your skin as well as that of those who work with you. 
 
As was originally designed in the first Red Faction, Geo-Mod builds the world around you as a means to destroy it. Using rockets, mines and the many other weapons available, you can take down walls, blast through doors (therefore deleting the need for a security key) and bring down enemies by destroying the floor that they stand on. Vehicles can also be used to help in your tasks. 
 
Multiplayer modes are also included for up to 4 players, as well as a collection of bots. As a note, the PC version does not have multiplayer.</desc>

It is also the first in the franchise to feature first-person shooting alongside the third-person movement seen in its predecessors in the Resident Evil series. It was developed by Capcom's Production Studio 3 and could be released for the PlayStation 2 as the company's then-effective exclusivity contract with Nintendo pertained only to numbered entries in the series. 
 The Capcom series that helped establish the survival horror genre steps back into the faster-paced action of first-person shooting in Resident Evil: Dead Aim. In this Resident Evil: Survivor-style addition to the franchise, players join the dangerously brave Anti-Umbrella Pursuit Investigation Team operator Bruce McGivern as he guns down the baddies in an all-new storyline. 
 Resident Evil: Dead Aim is designed to offer sharp graphics, steady action, and accessible gameplay. It supports Guncon 2 light gun controllers for a more authentic zombie-blasting experience. Remaining true to the spirit of the series, the game also features involved puzzle-solving, unsettling environments, and an abundance of creepy mutant monsters.</desc>

		<desc>A complete remake of the classic 1986 title Defender of the Crown (not to be confused with the "Remastered" Windows version released in 2002), in Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown the player plays as the legendary folk outlaw in his quest to reclaim the throne of England after Richard Lionheart was captured in the crusades and his brother, John Lackland, usurped the throne and left him for dead in the Holy Land, attracting the ire of several knights. In a heated argument, he considered them to be traitors, causing a civil war to start. 
 
Several gameplay features were changed from the classic title such as the player being Robin Hood himself (instead of picking one of four pretenders), full 3D graphics, a plot included with the game and the goal being to be the first to reach and conquer King John's stronghold in Cornwall. To do so, the player must build an army large enough to hold enough shires, which generate money from taxes. This money can then be used to hire new troops (peasants, archers, footmen and the mighty knights and catapults) or pay King Richard's ransom, which allow to enlist loyalist knights.</desc>

Agency, assigned to retrieve the Piglots and Power Drink cargo, but as he does he discovers a shocking secret that that can bring about the destruction of the Tyke System and a confrontation with the Vandocore Corporation. 
 
The gameplay is a 3-D platformer in the spirit of Ratchet &amp; Clank, with powerful weapons and odd-looking enemies.  There are three worlds altogether to explore with even some racing involved.  There is also a transformation mode that can cause Ruff to become a super-powered beast, it can be achieved by collecting glowing orbs scattered throughout the levels.</desc>

		<name>Runabout 3 : Neo Age</name>
		<desc>Runabout 3: Neo Age is an open-ended racing game where the racing isn't restricted to strict tracks and the player can choose their route, as the races are mostly driving from point A to point B. Like in the previous games, you don't really have to drive clean and crashing everywhere while winning the race is not only allowed but also encouraged as there is points to be gained from destroying various objects. 
 The game plays similarly to previous incarnations where you race through streets, this time destroying target objects and then heading towards your destination to fulfill the objective. Fun, wild and out of control, Runabout will appeal to masters of destruction who seek road thrills and have a desire to break any and all traffic laws ever drafted. 
 There are over 20 different vehicles to drive with and over 30 missions which range from simple races to checkpoint races and "deliver the package"-missions.</desc>

Set in Japan with hip hop feel from the hit TV series by the same name, this title allows gamers to breathe life to a "lost episode" as one of three playable characters - Mugen, a reckless samurai with break-dancing fighting style, calculated Jin who abides by the decorum of Bushido, and a mysterious new character exclusive to the video game. Stranded in northern land of Ezo (current day Hokkaido) in search of the samurai who smells of sunflowers, the player must face foreign mercenaries, master swordsmen, diabolical assassins, mythical beasts, and gangster monkeys. The core of the game's unique combat system lies in the innovative integration of music and linked attacks. The players can choose an array of combos based on the different hip hop grooves that they can swap at will. Music tracks become collectible, opening an extensive assortment of linked attacks that can be implemented tactically during combat.</desc>

		<name>Samurai Warriors</name>
		<desc>Samurai Warriors is Koei's extension of the popular Dynasty Warriors series. Instead of taking place during the Three Kingdoms era in China, Samurai Warriors takes you back to feudal Japan, during the warring states era. In the game, you take control of actual historical figures such as Yukimura Sanada, Nobunaga Oda, and Hattori Hanzo. Altogether, there are fifteen characters, ten of whom need to be unlocked. 
 
Basically, gameplay is almost identical to that of Dynasty Warriors. The main differences are things like the inclusion of indoor castle levels, and a greater variety of enemies. In Dynasty Warriors, enemies were basically either soldiers or archers. In Samurai Warriors, there are soldiers, archers, musketeers, and many different types of ninjas. In terms of story, there are basically only five levels, but depending on your actions in a certain level specific to each character, the story will branch of into two different stories, leading to a good ending or a not as good ending. Updated graphics and a more "techno-ish" soundtrack top off the additions.</desc>

As with the original Samurai Warriors, Samurai Warriors 2 is based on the Japanese Sengoku or "Warring States" period, a time of social upheaval, political intrigue, and nearly constant military conflict in Japan that lasted roughly from the middle of the 15th century to the beginning of the 17th century. 
 
The game is a third person hack-and-slash. You have 26 playable characters to choose from. Once you choose your character you are tossed into massive real-time battles, with the object being to help claim victory for your army by defeating key enemy officers, or simply slaying a large amount of enemy troops, which will boost the morale of your army, and turn the tides of the battle.</desc>

Although battles are still fought using the same 3rd-person button mashing mechanics that the Samurai Warriors-style games are known for, players now must also choose the battles to maximize the growth of their burgeoning empire in Japan's Warring States era.

Though Gojiro isn't interested in righting wrongs, he is soon caught up in the town's problems: killing highway robbers, protecting a woman from would-be rapists, and thwarting Goldberg's machinations. Focused on destroying Gojiro, Goldberg unleashes an endless stream of minions... all fodder for Gojiro's blade. But Goldberg has an ace up his sleeve... 
 
Samurai Western is a third-person action game. Gojiro's blade is more than a match for Old West weaponry as he can ably deflect or sidestep bullets. As Gojiro completes levels, he upgrades his skills, unlocks new swords and stances, and adds Western accessories to his wardrobe. Primarily a single-player game, Samurai Western has a two player co-op mode and unlockable characters for both modes.</desc>

		<desc>Scaler is a 3D platform game with elements of combat, stealth, and puzzle-solving. Upon accidentally uncovering his neighbor's evil plot to take over the universe with an army of mutant lizards, Bobby "Scaler" Johnson is put in the position to infiltrate the operation and bring it down from the inside. He is transported to another dimension and transformed into a lizard himself. The enemy army is strong and diverse, however, with different mutant lizard soldier types that are well suited for various tasks. 
 Luckily, after transforming from a boy into a lizard, changing from one lizard form to another eventually becomes relatively easy, and Scaler will need to assume the appearance and abilities of no fewer than five other creatures in order to accomplish all the objectives before him.</desc>

		<name>Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights</name>
		<desc>Scooby Doo! Night of 100 Frights is loosely based upon the Scooby Doo cartoon series, and thus strays little from the show's basic formula. The Scooby Gang (consisting of Fred, Velma, Daphne, Shaggy, and of course, Scooby Doo) attempts to unravel the mystery behind a haunted mansion where Daphne's friend's scientist father was working. Controlling the lovable canine himself, players must explore 12 levels spread across four different areas in and around the mansion. 
 Within each area are dozens of obstacles that require Scooby to make carefully timed jumps, activate switches, and dispatch any monsters in his path. While Scooby's primary means of offense is a jumping attack, as players progress through the adventure new powers can be found or bought, including a football helmet which enables Scooby to ram into enemies. Found strewn throughout the in-game environments are Scooby snacks. Collect the requisite number and the four-limbed protagonist will gain access to new areas. Once acquired, new items can be put to use in previously completed stages in order to unlock or discover previously hidden areas and secrets.</desc>

The game modes from the original are the same, featuring tournament mode, where you play against the pros; exhibition mode for a one-on-one, best-out-of-three game; and world tour mode which now features the option of creating and customizing your own player.

		<name>Sega Superstars</name>
		<desc>There are a total of 12 different full games to play in the main mode of Sega Superstars: 
 
    Sonic the Hedgehog â€“ As Sonic runs down a round tunnel, he follows the position of the player's hand. Using this method, the aim of the game is to gather rings and Chaos Emeralds in order to obtain the highest score at the end of the game. It is much like the Special Stage on Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic Heroes, and especially Sonic Rush. 
    Samba de Amigo â€“ Players choose a song, and then must hit 6 different targets around the screen as the 'beat balls' reach them in time with the music. Posing with hands over 2 of the targets, or holding one position until a trail of beat balls is complete, may also be required from the player. 
    ChuChu Rocket! â€“ Movement over a certain target on the screen will cause a bridge to raise, which the chu-chus then follow to the goal. The bridge also must be dropped at certain moments to prevent KapuKapus from destroying the score. 
    Puyo Pop Fever â€“ Differently colored puyos will fall from the top of the screen, and the player's body must be positioned to guide them into the corresponding pots and allow bombs to topple off the bottom of the screen. 
    Crazy Taxi â€“ Large movements and loud sounds must be undertaken to stop the Crazy Taxi and complete the level. 
    Super Monkey Ball â€“ The player must move their arms into different positions in order to guide the monkey ball around obstacles and towards the goal, picking up as many bananas as possible along the way. 
    NiGHTS Into Dreams â€“ NiGHTS must be controlled and navigated through rings, collecting chips along the way, by raising your arms into a 'flying' position and adjusting them along the way. 
    House of the Dead â€“ A multitude of different zombies must be attacked and defeated by hitting them. Innocent people who occasionally appear must also be avoided.

		<name>Sengoku Basara X</name>
		<desc>Sengoku Basara is a series of video games developed and published by Capcom, and a bigger media franchise based on it, including two anime series and an animated film. Its story is very loosely based around the many real characters and events of the titular Sengoku era in the history of feudal Japan. 
 Sengoku Basara has several adaptations of the games to different mediums. Notably, two anime series were planned and written by Yasuyuki Muto. The first series, simply titled Sengoku Basara, started broadcast in April 2009. The series' second season, titled Sengoku Basara II, began broadcast in July 2010. Further, a movie adaptation of the series titled Sengoku Basara: The Last Party was released in 2011. All three anime adaptations were licenced and published in the United States by Funimation. A manga adaptation of the second game was created by Yak Haibara. The four volume series, titled Sengoku Basara 2 was published in Japan in 2007 and was later published in the United States in 2012 by UDON under the title Sengoku Basara: Samurai Legends. The title change was due to Sengoku Basara 2 not being released in the United States. Shimotsuki Kairi also created a more general adaptation in 2005 entitled Sengoku Basara Ranse Ranbu.</desc>

Players control the young masterless Samurai Natoe as he confronts an army of mechanical beasts laying siege to humanity's last surviving city. Natoe slowly discovers that he must protect the "Holy Child," Earth's last hope. 
 To do this, he must unite and lead a group of samurai warriors against treacherous enemy forces. Gameplay includes several different ancient martial arts forms. The game's designers consulted with Akira Kurosawa's son, Hisao, during production to ensure authenticity. French comic artist Moebius designed character concepts, and Academy Award-winning composer Ryuichi Sakamoto delivered the soundtrack.</desc>

		<name>ShellShock : Nam '67</name>
		<desc>Shellshock takes you back to the years of the Vietnam war. You take on the role of a rookie soldier on his first tour of duty. Using a third-person perspective, you experience napalm bombardments of civilian villages, sneaky night missions along the river banks, claustrophobic tunnel systems and huge battles in temples and open fields. Most missions are played as a team, but your team members cannot die and do not influence the mission objectives. You will have to assassinate enemy generals, take out crucial boats and guide your team through unknown territory. 
 
The game does not have drivable vehicles, multiplayer options or extensive environmental interaction, but it features a particular system of dismantling the many bombs and traps: in a race against time, you have to perform a long key sequence in the correct order to clear the path. The atrocities on both sides are clearly shown in the cutscenes, filmed as through a shaky hand-camera. Either side is not afraid to abuse civilians for their cause and this sense of realism gives the game a rather raw edge. You can even purchase the services of hookers in the base camp.</desc>

In order to save the king's kingdom, Alleron must travel through a vast array of lands to finally bring down The Grand Inquisitor and his army once and for all. 
 
Shifters is a third person RPG set in the Might and Magic universe and the sequel to Warriors of Might and Magic. This is a typical RPG with a slight twist. Alleron is able to shift into a number of different creatures, such as genies, and classes, such as warlord. Each level is sectioned into small areas, some of which are filled with secret areas and available sidequests. In addition to the three level up categories (mind, body, soul), you can choose to level up your shifted forms in order to make them more powerful and unlock different classes.</desc>

It contains a second disc with a special version of Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne Maniax (itself an enhanced version of Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne), entitled Chronicle Edition, not available outside of this compilation.  
 
This version differs from the standard one by replacing Dante, the featured main character from Devil May Cry series, with Raidou Kuzunoha, the protagonist of the titular game, as well as his cat Gotou. Raidou is confronted as a boss enemy early in the game, replacing Dante. Following a brief dialogue with Gotou, the player-controlled party fights Raidou, whose attacks are similar to those displayed by Dante in the earlier version. Raidou can also be recruited as a playable character later, if the player fulfills conditions similar to those that were required to recruit Dante.</desc>

They devote themselves to fighting against the never-ending resistance mustered by other tribes. In the midst of chaos, a mysterious object, the Pod, suddenly appears. Countless spheres of light are emitted by the Pod and infect Serf and his comrades, awakening their demonic powers. An unimaginable battle unfolds within their faint conscience. They develop a desire to tear the flesh and shatter the bones of their enemies, who have also been transformed. Their instincts tell them to devour every being in their path. Until then, Serf and his comrades only knew of battle, but for the first time, they experience new emotions. At that time, a dark-haired girl, Sera, comes to their rescue. Although she does not know where she came from, she holds a strange power - the power to control the party's demonic transformation. They receive orders from the Church of Karma to head for Nirvana, and they are accompanied by the dark-haired girl. "They who reach Nirvana first shall be recognized as the champions of Junkyard." The struggle intensifies, and they discover that the girl holds a key to the mystery. But, true fear still awaits Serf's party. Including Embryon, the tribe that the main character leads, several groups are at war with each other in order to survive.

You play Xion, a hero who is drawn into saving the City of Shilidia from a formerly peaceful neighbor due to his possession of the powerful Twin Dragon Rings. This sets the stage for an epic RPG storyline with fun characters and big surprises. 
 
Presented in beautiful hand-drawn 2D graphics and backgrounds, players may choose to go into battles from among 8 unlockable companions, each with their own unique powers, strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, the co-op system lets two players cooperate in battles, pulling off special combo moves and leveling up their characters together. Interestingly, the companion you pick changes Xion to the opposite 'soul' dark or light due to the nature of the Twin Dragon Rings, with correspondingly different powers. Single players have their companion AI to help them out of tight spots, too.</desc>

		<name>Shrek 2</name>
		<desc>Shrek 2's storyline follows a similar, but slightly different plot compared to that of the movie. Shrek and Fiona are on a journey to the Kingdom of Far Far Away to visit Fiona's parents. Shrek's in-laws aren't too thrilled that a crude ogre is married to their beloved daughter, Fiona, so the battle for acceptance ensues. The game also covers things not shown in the film. Plot elements are delivered primarily through a storybook interface (text and illustrations) shown before each level. The player is able to play as Shrek or his friends throughout the game, and travel through 11 levels, while being able to switch between the four characters available in each level. In each level, the player controls a team of four characters, and can switch between them at any point. Each character has a unique ability that aids them in fighting enemies or moving through the environment (for example, Donkey can destroy obstacles and Fiona can slow down time).</desc>

		<name>Silent Hill : Shattered Memories</name>
		<desc>Billed as a re-imagining of the original Silent Hill, Shattered Memories once again casts you as Harry Mason searching across the haunted town for his missing daughter Cheryl. New to the series are a depiction of Silent Hill's demonic alter-dimension as a world of ice, and the removal of weapons from the game - when the monsters come out, Harry must literally run for his life. 
 
Between scenes, the game will cut to a psychiatrist's office, who asks you personal questions about yourself and your past experiences. The game will then alter itself based on your responses, changing characters and lines of dialog to something intended to be more personally uncomfortable. 
 
As you search for Cheryl, you will come across objects and recordings that tell some of the history of Silent Hill.</desc>

		<name>Sky Gunner</name>
		<desc>SkyGunner is a third person flight combat game, with its emphasis on action. Players choose to take the role of either Ciel, Femme, or Copain, each with their own campaign and unique flying abilities and special skill. Players can turn the plane's direction up, down, left and right, perform barrel rolls, and use afterburners. Weaponry is handled by a complex system of targeting, with involves two types: "Look Targeting" and "Weapon Lock". Look Targeting simply assigns a particular enemy at the center of the camera and can be switched between at any time. The player must still maneuver near the enemy and target them with the cross hairs in order to shoot them. Depending on the secondary weapon selected, players can roll the cross hairs over the wing leader of an enemy group or the sequentially lead gun on a battleship, allowing the player to instantly target multiples from that group. 
 
The primary weapon of each airplane is a machine gun which fires straight ahead. More destructive secondary weapons are also available, that includes Firework Missiles which create area explosions, Dog Missiles which slow and/or immobilize targets and Cross Missiles which stick to targets and need to be shot by a machine gun to detonate. Copain also has his own weapon, the Pumpkin Bomb which is a big destructive bomb. These secondary weapons are automatically replenished with the destruction of chains of enemies and/or combos. Chains/Combos are also the way to activate score multipliers, which affect the amount of money won in each mission. Ciel, Copain and Femme are continually in competition throughout the game and often bonuses (such as faster engines) are given to the character with the highest score in specific missions. Bonus scores are also awarded for specific mission events.</desc>

It is the fourth racing game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, preceded by Sonic Drift, Sonic Drift 2 and Sonic R. 
 
The game was released to start off the 15th anniversary of the release of the Sonic the Hedgehog series. For a short while, the Microsoft Xbox version of the game was released with a free Sonic X DVD.[citation needed] This game introduces five new playable characters, the Babylon Rogues and the E-10000 series. A sequel to Sonic Riders, entitled Sonic Riders: Zero Gravity, was released in 2008 for the Wii and PlayStation 2, followed by the Kinect-required game Sonic Free Riders for the Xbox 360 in 2010. This was the last Sonic the Hedgehog game for the GameCube and Microsoft Xbox.</desc>

		<name>Soul Nomad &amp; the World Eaters</name>
		<desc>Soul Nomad &amp; the World Eaters begins in a world called Prodesta where an evil entity named Gig has returned with his three beasts known as World Eaters. The land of Prodesta has battled these monsters before, two hundred years earlier when Princess Layna sacrificed herself to capture the enemies and save the land from certain doom. Now they are back and you are the chosen hero who must battle through several environments to keep Prodesta alive. After creating your character, you learn that Gig has possessed your body and is offering you his strength to defeat your foes. Unfortunately, the powers you accept from Gig allow him to overtake more of your mind. A large part of the game is learning how much power you can use before you are completely consumed by evil. You are sent through the world to battle Gig's minions on grid-based battlefields with a party of your creation.

		<desc>An action game spin-off in the Total Warrior series. Play as a mighty Spartan trooper, and battle through hordes of enemies in large environments, while working with allies. Use ultra-violent special attacks to mow down entire groups of foes at once, with ridiculously bloody effect. 
 
The game has a fast-paced, arcade-like, mission-based gameplay. In each mission, you must succeed in minor goals like killing the generals of the opposition, escorting sappers to blow up enemy siege weaponry and preventing the enemy from making to behind your borders. The storyline progresses through cutscenes, shown in-between each mission. 
 
Depending on how you succeed in your mission, you get "tokens", which you can use to upgrade the health, damage or power of your character. The player is capable of doing special moves, which can be learned throughout the game. Some of the special moves gain their powers through the spartan gods, that aid the player in his battle. During the game, you can find different weapons like swords, bows and spears, and of course, shields.</desc>

		<desc>Speed Racer is based on the Wachowski Brothers film of the same name, which is in turn based on a Japanese anime series from the 1960's. The main storyline is based around winning the World Racing League Cup. This video game adaptation focuses on the racing aspect of the film and it is the first third-party game for the Wii to support the Wii Wheel. More than 15 characters from the film are represented as playable drivers in the game and the vehicles from the film can be selected from the game's menu. Maximum speeds during the races can exceed 350 MPH. 
 
The race tracks feature loops, jumps, corkscrews, and many twists and turns. They all have a high-tech look with bright colors. The game offers split-screen multiplayer in addition to single player races. Drivers can engage in combat during races by employing "car-fu" manoeuvres such as "tail toss", "boost bash", "smack down", "round house", and "torpedo", among others.</desc>

Levels are in "sections" with a different enemy for each, each section lasting about 3 levels. Each level, except for the last two, has a bonus screen after it. Generally, there are the bonuses "Time" (clear level in a set time), "Perfect" (Not take damage/detected) and "Style" (use as many combos as possible). Other level-specific ones are "Secrets" (Uncover a secret area), "Combat" (Defeat all enemies). Players can gain, depending on difficulty, points on completing these tasks.</desc>

All six characters suddenly find themselves targeted by an enemy force and one-by-one, the villains begin disappearing. Meanwhile, Spider-Man is rescued by Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D., who informs him that the meteor which brought the Venom symbiote to Earth had broken up in the Earth's atmosphere and five more pieces had landed in numerous locations across the globe. Fury sends Spider-Man to retrieve the shards of meteors. Spider-Man quickly finds that the villains who attacked him and several more of his foes, including Rhino and Scorpion, have been placed under mind control of a mysterious villain. The villain also creates and controls holographic/symbiote combination foot soldiers called P.H.A.N.T.O.M.s (short for Perpetual Holographic Avatar Nano-Tech Offensive Monsters). As Spider-Man fights his enemies one-by-one and rescues them from the mind control, they promise to aid him in finding the villain responsible. As Spider-Man progresses, he obtains more allies such as Black Cat, Iron Fist, Lizard (not portrayed as a villain), and Blade. He discovers that the evil genius is Mysterio, who intends to use his army to take over the world, using each shard of the meteor to make them stronger. Spider-Man decides to temporarily don the Black Suit for the final battle.</desc>

Spider-Man is trying to balance his civilian and superhero life, frequently late or absent for school, work, and leisure time with his friends. Following dinner with Mary Jane Watson, Peter thwarts an armed looting of an art museum, and tracks down an escaped robber, the Black Cat. Soon after this, he thwarts an attack in the streets of Manhattan by The Rhino. Meanwhile, Doctor Otto Octavius attempts to recreate nuclear fusion of that seen in the sun to provide an energy source for Manhattan. To control this fusion, he creates four metal arms which he can mentally control. His fusion creates a strong magnetic field, destroying the lab, killing his wife Rosie, and grafting his metal arms to his spine and giving his arms control over him. He blames Spider-Man for the incident, despite the fact that Spider-Man was not in the lab until the middle of it.</desc>

Objectives are generally to destroy things like enemy weapons, equipment and communications towers, to avoid civilian casualties, to tag things with tracking devices and so on, although some objectives that are a little different include escaping from a warehouse using a trabant within a tight time limit, escorting and protecting allied vehicles and even chasing and destroying a stolen Interceptor vehicle.</desc>

Also featured are special characters for each group including: Droidekas (CIS), Jet Troopers (Republic), Dark Troopers (Imperials), and Wookie Smugglers (Rebels).

There are 17 levels, interlaced with over 12 minutes of footage from the movie. Enemies include droids, clone soldiers and Neimodian forces. The game's combat system is heavily concentrated on lightsaber combat. Each of the playable characters (with the exception of the IG-100 Magnaguard) is equipped with at least one lightsaber. There are three basic attacks: Fast attacks which do the least amount of damage, Strong Attacks which do more damage but are slower to execute, and the slowest but strongest Critical Attacks. These attacks can be mixed to create combination attacks. Attacks can also be charged up for greater strength. One feature of the game is called a Saber Lock - a sequence in which the player's character clashes swords with an opponent. Other offensive maneuvers are also available, including grapples, jumps and flying kicks.</desc>

While flying around the many familiar landscapes (Tatooine, the underwater village Otoh Gunga and a driod control ship in orbit over Naboo) your character can use the many weapons and power-ups that litter the tracks, as well as using moves that only they can perform. For example. Jar-Jar uses his tongue to grab onto anyone in front of him, so he can catch up, while Darth Maul throws his double edged lightsaber as a very deadly weapon. 
 
Also keep an eye out for monsters and items that get in the way on the track. Some may be useful, others very annoying.</desc>

		<desc>Beginning where Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones left off, you must take control of either Anakin Skywalker, Mace Windu or Obi-Wan Kenobi and lead the Republic Army against the Confederacy of Independent Systems. 
 
The Clone Wars picks up with Mace Windu escorting the Jedi ambush to the Geonosis arena, which leads to the Battle of Geonosis and the start of the Clone Wars. After the Battle of Geonosis, Anakin and Obi Wan are sent to patrol a dead part of Republic sector, until a massive Confederate fleet ambushes the strategically useless planet of Rhen Var. After this, Anakin, Obi Wan soon discover that there may be something darker behind the invasion of Rhen Var. They find out about the Dark Reaper, an evil and powerful Sith device that could harvest the power of the living and use it as a concentrated weapon. Now it is up to the Republic to prevent this weapon from ever activating and destroying the galaxy! 
 
The Clone Wars has you deep inside the battles of the Old Republic through 16 missions, piloting a range of vehicles including speeder bikes, Republic Gunships and fighter tanks as well as the weapon of the Jedi, your lightsabre, for close combat. Whereas the Rogue Squadron series concentrated on aerial battles, The Clone Wars contains almost all ground battles. You must fight as Anakin Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Mace Windu, and others throughout the game to prevent the Confederacy from gaining a deadly weapon. Multiplayer options are also included for up to four players with game types including deathmatch, conquest, and a co-op ground and vehicle survival mode.</desc>

		<desc>Starsky &amp; Hutch is an arcade racing game based on the popular TV series from the 70s, released to tie in with the film. The game includes 18 missions, each based on an episode of the TV show and introduced by Antonio 'Huggy Bear' Fargas. There is also a free roaming mode, in which the player explores the GTA-esque environment looking for action and trouble. 
 
Like the film, the game does not entirely play it straight. Starsky &amp; Hutch are actually shooting a TV show, and the scoring for each mission reflects how ratings-friendly your driving is. You are awarded gold, silver or bronze medals for each mission depending on performance, and must get at least 1 gold and 2 silvers on season 1 for a second season to be commissioned, and 3 golds and 2 silvers in season 2 for there to be a third for you to play through. 
 
The overall goal in each mission is usually to chase and destroy a criminal's car. There is always a secondary target as well. In addition, the player will gain viewers by hitting the bad guy, pulling off elaborate jumps and skids, nearly hitting civilians, and hitting the bonus targets such as canisters which are strewn through the levels. Hitting civilians will lose viewers.</desc>

		<desc>You play as Anya Romanov, a thief living in a not too distant future. You and your partner in crime, Louie Palmer, have recently landed a job to steal a statue that's been placed in a museum for an exhibition. Once you're in the museum things turn out not to be quite so easy and not quite the way the should be. 
 
The gameplay resembles Thief: The Dark Project but also feels a lot like Splinter Cell and Metal Gear Solid to an extent. Several elements can be recognized from those games, but many of these have been changed slightly or just implemented in an original way. The core of the game is about stealing, without killing.</desc>

The priestesses of Laharah declared Maia as the goddess when she was an infant and armies rose up in Maia's name, led by the Emperor's brother Prince Taurgis, making Halassar independent from Galdyr and Maia, the Queen of the Halassar Empire. Traveling with her is Sangaril, an orphan trained by the Shadow Clan assassins of the Munari, who was sent to kill Maia as a child, but instead became her sworn bodyguard. While reclaiming the Book of Prophets from the Halassar Palace traitor Dama Sivora, Maia activates a rune stone embedded in the pirate island stronghold of Prince Neru, on the Isle of Teomura, gaining the ability to transform into one of the 4 Summons. After recovering the Book of the Prophets and returning to the Palace she learns more about her destiny.</desc>

		<name>Superman Returns</name>
		<desc>Superman Returns is based on the movie of the same name. You control the man himself as he flies around Metropolis, saves citizens and fights natural disasters, fires and supervillains alike. 
 
You have constant access to Superman's powers including heat vision, freeze breath, invulnerability and flight at supersonic speeds, though the former two are limited by a stamina bar. Unusually for this genre, Superman himself does not take damage and the challenges are all built around saving others from harm. 
 
Combat is accomplished through melee (you learn new combos as you progress in the game) as well as direct application of Superman's heat vision and freeze breath. Additionally, you may pick up objects, from the Daily Planet globe to tanker trucks, to throw at villains. You can also rip down a lamppost and use it as a club. 
 
Metropolis is presented as a wide open world where you can fly anywhere and perform any of the side missions at any given time. Besides the main story missions, there are 200 kittens to rescue and many fires to put out. 
 
The basic game is broken up a bit with two rather different sequences. There is a race around the city against Myxyzptlk and a Bizarro mode, in which you must destroy the city.</desc>

		<name>Taiko Drum Master</name>
		<desc>Taiko Drum Master is an entry in Namco's Taiko No Tatsujin rhythm game series and the first to have a Western release. As in other rhythm games, the goal is to interact with a special controller according to scrolling onscreen prompts timed to music. This game comes bundled with the TaTaCon drum controller, a miniature version of a Japanese taiko drum with sensors in the middle and on the sides. 
 
In-game actions are indicated by scrolling circle icons. Red circles indicate hitting the center of the drum, while blue circles require the player to hit the edge. On big circles, the player can hit both center or edge sensors for bonus points. Finally, yellow lines and balloons require the player to perform drum rolls. 
 
The game comes with a varied set of tunes: from covered pop hits like Material Girl and ABC to music from other Namco games such as Katamari Damacy and Dragon Spirit and even television theme songs. In addition, there are also several mini-games included on the disc that use the TaTaCon for more esoteric purposes, such as watermelon eating and wolf-stacking.</desc>

During the game the player is directly in control of Darwin, but can also command the followers directly around him. These followers can be commanded to attack animals, carry items, or complete tasks such as building ramps and bridges. Finding items while exploring can increase Darwin's stats and the number of followers he can bring with him. Items can also be returned to Darwin's village to expand and upgrade the services available there, such as healing at the mess hall or recruiting additional followers at the bar.</desc>

		<name>Tekken's Nina Williams in : Death by Degrees</name>
		<desc>Nina Williams, world-renowned assassin, has been hired by the CIA and MI6 to join a team which is attempting to infiltrate "Kometa," a notorious criminal organization. The team's strategy involves gaining access to the target through a fighting tournament being held on the "Amphitrite," a luxury cruise ship owned and operated by Kometa. 
 
The game's most remarkable feature is the ability to allow Nina to use her martial arts skills to break the bones of her enemies through use of carefully aimed attacks. These attacks do more damage to the enemy and show the player the damage being inflicted on the opponent's skeletal structure. Strangely, this does little to actually disable opponents, as they often continue to use limbs that have been literally shattered, as well as survive blows to the head that would cause the skull to practically explode, without even losing consciousness. 
 
Once the game is completed, "Anna Mode" will be unlocked, offering the player the ability to play as Nina's younger sibling, Anna. Various outfits can be unlocked throughout the game, which include a bikini, cocktail dress, purple jumpsuit, black and silver stealth suit. Playing the game a second time causes LCD crates throughout the game to contain infinite supplies of certain weapons, such as infinite katana and infinite rail-gun. After completing the game twice, the wrestling costume as seen in the opening FMV is also unlocked. A third clear game file additionally unlocks "Tekken 2 Nina", which instead of an outfit is actually a different facial and bodily construction, exactly as she appears in the Tekken title, in low resolution.</desc>

		<desc>The player controls the Hulk in an open world environment in which the player can visit most locations and interact with the environment while not engaged in missions. The game's bosses include Devil Hulk and Mercy, and the game's main villain is the Abomination. 
 
Boasting "Unstoppable Movement" means Hulk can run across walls and other vertical surfaces, climb any wall by digging his fingers into concrete, leap huge heights and distances all under the player's control. Hulk's combat abilities also reflect this increased power; cars and buses are simply smashed out of the way while fully charged attacks will toss vehicles, enemies and unlucky pedestrians into the air. At his most powerful, the Hulk can perform one of five different ultra-powerful Devastator attacks including the Critical Atomic Slam and the Critical Thunderclap. These attacks will clear enemies out for a multi-block radius, flatten entire buildings, and cause massive damage to enemies.</desc>

Gameplay[edit] 
The game plays somewhat like the Final Fantasy series' Active Time Battle, with the player having to wait certain time for their turn. What makes this system different from ATB is that actions take different amounts of time based on the weapon or ability used, for example an axe will need more time than a dagger to attack. 
 
The game features a vast world to explore; there are several towns and a variety of monsters to combat. The game also features multi-player experience after unlocking the second character in the story.</desc>

		<desc>The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor follows the same plot as the film. The player controls either Rick O'Connell or his son, Alex, from a third-person perspective. The game combines platforming, puzzle-solving, and combat elements into its gameplay, and consists of six levels. The game's platforming sections, have been compared to those of the Tomb Raider series, and allow the player to perform several acrobatic manoeuvres, such as jumping or shimmying along edges. The player must also evade dangers and traps such as rotating saws or falling debris. During combat, the game allows the player to switch between gun combat and hand-to-hand combat. The player has a range of melee attacks that can be used against enemies, and can also evade the attacks of enemies. Gun combat features a lock-on system, and the player can use either pistols, shotguns or tommy guns. The game also includes puzzle-solving, in the form of hieroglyphic decoding.Additional unlockables, such as concept art, can be obtained by collecting artifacts hidden throughout the levels.</desc>

		<desc>In this turn-based dungeon crawler you play as Gil, whose beloved fiancee has been kidnapped by a sorceress and taken to the Tower of Druaga. Gil puts on a suit of armor that radiates light, and proceeds into the dungeon to save his beloved Ki. 
 
The combat system and exploration might be the best part of the game. The map is set up in a grid, and you do everything in turns, like moving, battling, or recovering. The timing of moves is also critical, and the game feels like a real-time game because you aren't waiting like you typically would for turn-based games. 
 
The Nightmare of Druaga: Fushigino dungeon is a collaboration between the Mysterious Dungeon series and the arcade classic The Tower of Druaga.</desc>

The player takes on the role of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa or Apu and try to uncover a mystery surrounding mechanical bees that are taking over Springfield, mysterious vans, and cola that can control the minds of those who drink it. 
 
Like GTA, the game follows a linear-based path through fifty plus missions. The player will have to chase cars and find out where they're headed, grab all the spilling cola cans before people can drink them, and chasing down villains before they get away. 
 
Throughout the course of the game, the player can unlock tons of rewards by completing missions in a set amount of time or performing outstanding stunts. 
 
All voiceovers are performed by those who act in the show, including Dan Castellaneta (Homer), Julie Kavner (Marge) and Yeardley Smith (Lisa). 
 
The game supports multiplayer action for up to four players.</desc>

		<desc>The game begins on a boat after the player creates a crew of characters. The crew can consist of one to six Sims. After the crew's creation, a slide-show starts of some mobile phone pictures that are taken showing the trip and also showing the storm that wrecks the ship. The player's starting Sim wakes up on First Beach on Shipwreck Island. The Sim finds books detailing the goals the Sim must follow to survive on the islands and escape. Shortly after exploring Shipwreck Island, the Sim discovers a second island, Airplane Island, this one considerably larger and more interesting than the first, and builds a raft to reach the new location. After arriving on the island, the Sim is reunited with some of their lost crew. The player then has the option to form a tribe of Sims if the relationship is strong enough. While exploring Airplane Island, the player finds radio parts that are required to complete a goal later in the game. A third island, Volcano Island, can be reached once the player finds the second beach on Airplane Island and builds a canoe. On Volcano Island, the player will discover the remains of the llama people. The player has the option to return to civilization on this island. They can either build a boat or travel to the volcano's summit and use the radio parts to send an SOS signal to a nearby ship. The player can also repair a broken ceremonial forge on Volcano Island that will cause a fourth island, Crystal Island, to rise out of the sea, however this is optional and is not required for the player to escape the island. The game contains many discoverable secrets, including secret areas such as Hidden Lagoon and the Secret Pirate's Cove. These areas can only be accessed once the player has gathered objects such as hieroglyphics and treasure map pieces, however this is a relatively extensive process.</desc>

		<name>Tak and the Power of Juju</name>
		<desc>An ancient prophecy foretells that the Moon Juju, the kind protector of the Pupanunu people, would be weakened by the evil Tlaloc, an embittered Pupanunu shaman, so he could turn the Pupanunu people into sheep as revenge for not being made high shaman in favor of another shaman, Jibolba. The prophecy also mentions a great and mighty warrior who would restore the Moon Juju, defeat Tlaloc, and bring peace to the Pupanunu people. 
 
Having escaped Tlaloc's spell, Jibolba believes his apprentice Lok to be the warrior of the prophecy and prepares to send him off; however, it appears that Lok has been turned into a sheep. Jibolba sends his younger apprentice, Tak (voiced by Jason Marsden), to find magical plants and change him back, though it turns out not to be Lok. Jibolba tells Tak to obtain the Spirit Rattle, which allows the wielder to communicate with powerful Juju spirits to assist him, while he finds Lok. 
 
Tak returns with the Rattle to find that Lok has been trampled to death by a herd of sheep. Jibolba has Tak collect 100 magic Yorbels and Lok's spirit from the spirit world, allowing him to successfully resurrect Lok. An unfortunate side-effect of the resurrection, however, is a severe case of diarrhea. Tak obtains the Moon Stones instead while Lok recovers, restoring the Moon Juju to full strength. 
 
The Moon Juju reveals that the warrior of the prophecy is not Lok, but Tak, as he has already fulfilled almost everything the prophecy predicted. Using his arsenal of Juju spells, Tak defeats Tlaloc and turns him into a sheep, finally fulfilling the prophecy.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the newer anime styled FOX cartoon of the same name, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles features Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo and Donatello as green ninjas. Living in the sewers, they creep out when nobody is looking to fight for truth, justice and another slice of pizza. Fighting against the public face of inventor Baxter Stockman and the more shadowy figure of Shredder and his Foot Clan, these Ninja Turtles will get the chance to make their opponents eat shell! 
 
The game is a 3D beat-em-up with multiple players. The game sprites all resemble the cartoony look of the TV show and each turtle features unique moves, sound bytes and fighting style all his own. Ninja Turtle moves include a weaker/quicker attack, a stronger/slower attack, Ninja Shuriken and a Jump-Kick. There is a story mode for one or two players, and there is also a versus mode where two players can fight head to head. In the versus mode, players can fight as all 4 turtles, Splinter, Casey Jones, Hamato Yoshi, The Turtlebot, Hun, Oroku Saki, and Shredder. A Challenge mode is unlockable by defeating Oroku Saki with any Turtle in the Story Mode, which needs to be complete to unlock Hamato Yoshi and his dojo.</desc>

		<name>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3 : Mutant Nightmare</name>
		<desc>TMNT3 puts more of a focus on teamwork, character development and control than any other console Turtles game to date. Gamers can play as their favorite Turtle alone or with up to three friends, earning experience points along the way as they slash and bash Foot Ninjas and powerful, well-known bosses from the TMNT universe. These experience points allow players to improve and evolve their Turtles' traits and abilities for more varied, powerful attacks and moves. The Ninja Scroll System is another new feature on TMMT3. Being able to select which ninja scrolls to use allows the Turtles to use various special abilities strategically. Cooperative play lies at the heart of TMNT3 and gamers who team up with friends for multiplayer action are rewarded with exclusive features such as Cooperative Attack for even more shell shocking damage to enemies. The effect of this attack changes depending on the number of players working together (between 2-4 players). For even greater control, TMNT3 features a new combat system called the Target Attack system that lets gamers play more instinctively and strategically. With the Target Attack system, players will be able to lock onto specific enemies and block, dodge or counter attack accordingly for smoother and more maneuverable combat. Story Mode can be played with 1-4 players. Even when you have less than 4 players to play, the other Turtles will be at your side, controlled through AI. All the Turtles can participate in Cooperative Attack to beat enemies and players can give commands to the AI.</desc>

He soon discovers that the crystals he has found can power up a time machine. After having located traces of TimeSplitter activities in various time periods on the Earth, Cortez boards the time machine and travels to these periods, hoping to aid various characters in their battles against evil. 
 
TimeSplitters: Future Perfect is a first-person shooter in which players battle their way through thirteen story missions spread across six time periods, either alone or cooperatively. The protagonist's arsenal varies depending on the time period he travels to: for example, traveling to 1924 will allow Cortez to wield World War I weapons; a Soviet setting in the 1960's contains various local firearms of that time period; stages that take place in the future feature corresponding futuristic weaponry, etc. In addition to fast-paced shooting gameplay there are also some stealth and vehicle-driving segments. 
 
Like in the previous installments of the series, various multiplayer modes are included. Players can take on computer-controlled opponents on any of the fifteen arcade maps, or make their own ones. Players can also compete for awards in dozens of arcade league matches and challenges. It is possible to choose from between 150 characters and challenge other players to a head-to-head battle, either with up to four-player split screen or online and LAN play.</desc>

Leonardo returns from his meditation in South America to find his family in disarray, and crime on the rise in New York.  A mysterious figure calling himself the "Nightwatcher" has turned up, and a shadowy rich man named Winters seems to be in cahoots with the remnants of the Foot Clan.  Only the Ninja Turtles can clean up the streets! 
 
TMNT is an action game, similar to Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time.  Play as Leonardo, Michelangelo, Raphael and Donatello, swapping on the fly and using special co-operative moves to help your brothers in battle.  Each turtle, being a ninja, can perform moves like double jumping, running along and up walls, gripping onto tiny cracks in the walls, and jumping from wall to wall to scale dizzying heights.  Most of the game is spent making your way to the next destination by using your ninja moves to explore New York.  Each character also has their own special move: Leo can traverse through walls, Raph can use his Sais to scale particular surfaces, Mikey can use his Nunchucks as helicopters to float for a short period, and Don can pole vault across long gaps with his Bo Staff.</desc>

		<desc>Rainbow responds to a series of terrorist attacks against US interests in South America, apparently being conducted by Islamic terrorists sponsored by Saudi Arabia. However, the true mastermind behind the attacks is actually the newly elected President of Venezuela, Juan Crespo. Crespo managed to get elected by advocating a strong anti-terror platform and exploiting the fear caused by the terrorist attacks (which he himself orchestrated). Crespo's plan is to discredit Saudi Arabia, then cut off the Venezuelan supply of oil to the United States, creating an oil crisis and driving up the price of oil, which he would then sell to the US on the black market at highly inflated prices. 
 
Rainbow manages to foil Crespo's plans, and ultimately assassinates President Crespo himself. Rainbow then arranges for the international media to credit the terrorists with causing Crespo's death.</desc>

A new maneuver, the Bert Slide, was added to skateboarding controls. In the September 2005 edition of Game Informer, a map was shown displaying American Wasteland's Los Angeles with an insert of an overhead view of the Boston stage from Underground 2 for comparison. The Boston level appeared to be about three quarters the size of one American Wasteland area, with the exception of the "Vans Skatepark" and "Casino" areas.</desc>

		<desc>This game saw the introduction of the revert, a trick that enabled vert combos to be tied together with a manual, by tapping a button when landing in a quarterpipe. This allowed for much longer combos than in the previous two games, where landing in a quarterpipe would finish a combo. The game also added hidden combos. These were variations on standard tricks that could be performed as grab, flip, lip, or grind tricks. For example, double-tapping the kickflip button would, naturally, make the character perform a double kickflip.</desc>

		<desc>Top Spin is the Xbox's first tennis game, and it's playable over Xbox Live, allowing the player to compete in the XSN Sports Network. Over Xbox Live, two players can face each other in a one-on-one match, while in a doubles game up to four players can join. Stats are recorded and rankings are updated hourly at XSNsports.com. 
 
The game has a career mode that takes the player all over the world. The first step is to create a player and give him a technical mastery. Once in the game, the player may compete in various tournaments. There are games, minor pro games, and professional tournaments. Winning games earns money and a higher ranking. The goal is to go from rank one hundred to number one. 
 
Four different statistics can be gradually improved: serve, backhand, forehand, and volley. A higher skill will make for better and harder serves, more accurate and powerful back- and forehands, and the ability to keep the ball in play longer with volleys. There are also skills to obtain, such as risk and ace, which improves chances of hitting a successful risk shot or acing the opponent on a serve. 
 
In Exhibition mode, the player may choose a created character or one of several real life pros, such as Pete Sampras or Anna Kournikova.</desc>

		<name>Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen</name>
		<desc>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a game based on the movie of the same name. Set a few years after the defeat of Megatron in the first game/movie, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen reveals that the threat from the Decepticons has in fact, far from ended. Since the end of the first movie Decepticons have began popping up again all over Earth. They are in search of a mysterious object from space that will gift the balance of power. 
 
The game is a linear third-person shooter that puts the player in control of many of the main characters from the movie, shifting between both Autobot and Decepticon factions. The storyline is told via cutscenes that also allow for the player to easily transition from one character to the other. Playable characters on the Autobot side include: Optimus Prime, Iron Hide, Jetfire, Bumblebee. The Decepticon side includes: Starscream, Sideways (a new character), and Megatron. 
 
Though the game doesnâ€™t allow transform wherever the player wants to, transformation has been introduced as special attacks during robot mode, as fixed alternate game modes (driving Shanghai tunnels as Sideways, and fly through the skies of Russia as Starscream) and, in both robot and vehicle modes, as special moves that give the player alternate abilities. For example, transforming as Starscream while flying will enable him to fly backwards as a robot to take out enemies behind the protagonist. 
 
For multiplayer, at any point during a single-player campaign a friend can join in as a "Remote Weapon System", which allows them to shoot enemies, erect a shield to defend and transfer energon between both players.</desc>

		<name>Trapt</name>
		<desc>Tecmo presents TRAPT for the PS2, a puzzle-based game that contains a number of horror elements in its interesting storyline. The game is a continuation of the KAGERO: Deception series that began on the Playstation, but players aren't required to play the original games to understand TRAPT. The storyline begins when Princess Allura is framed for killing her father. As she flees the castle, players learn her dark secret: she's possessed by a demon known as Fiend. Fiend allows Allura to set a number of different traps to kill people, giving Fiend souls to survive off of. As the storyline progresses, players learn more about Fiend and how he came to possess the princess. The gameplay in TRAPT is very unique. As Allura, players run around the room setting traps while avoiding enemies. Once up to nine traps are set, they can be activated once an enemy is near. The traps come in a number of different types, including floor traps like bombs, wall traps like spikes, and ceiling traps like metal balls. Once players understand the system, they can start laying out traps in a way that an enemy will be hit by several at once to create a combo. Of course, it isn't quite that simple: some enemies are immune to certain traps, and some rooms contain areas where traps can't be placed. TRAPT weaves together unique characters, horror elements, and a fun, different gameplay style to create a unique game that will provide hours of challenge.</desc>

Besides having to do this, Marcus is a street-level cop. He is responsible for anything from stopping street fights to stopping gang wars to defusing bombs! Not only this, he can frisk people on the street for contraband, can do trunk searches on cars, as well as issue tickets to speeders.

Need some a way to stabilize your career after that rampage last week? Plant some evidence on a guy and bring him in. No one will know. Pistols not cutting it for you? The gun stores sell police officers anything, from M4's to flamethrowers to RPGs. 
 
With the city of New York at your fingertips, and nearly every building accessible to you, how will you rule? Will you be a shining beacon of morals, or a shady figure in the underworld of NY. The choice is up to you.</desc>

Each fighter possess a fighting style that varies between Boxing, Karate, Kung-Fu, Kempo, Muay Thai, Ninjitsu, Sambo, Submission, Sumo, Pro Wrestling, Kickboxing, Wrestling, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, and more. Each of the four face buttons on the controller specifically controls one of the fighter's limbs. By hitting two buttons at once, the player can perform a takedown, a grappling move, a submission move or other similar technique. An addition made to Sudden Impact's gameplay is an added focus on fence positioning. When backing an opponent into the cage that surrounds the Octagon ring, attempting a grapple maneuver will put the player into one of several different possible positions, including a standing face-off as well as a special ground-mount, where the bottom fighter's head is literally pressed against the cage. The overall gameplay is also slightly faster in comparison to the previous games. Fights are announced by Bruce Buffer and refereed by "Big" John McCarthy.</desc>

		<desc>The story revolves around the Planet Mischief, where there is a tradition that once someone turns 3-years old, he/she must travel to a planet and learn how to perform "Mischief" and cause panic on that planet. Cosmi, a three-year old alien, travels to Earth for his mission, in order to impress his father, the Master of Mischief, Cosmi Sr., mostly because Earth is considered the greatest challenge. Cosmi crashes with a TV satellite from a town called Coco Town. When crash landing, he manages to hide in an alley on Coco Town, where he is saved by Earth's Mischief Master, Master Itazura. He takes him to his Dojo to train, and lets Cosmi move on with his mission, on 8 different locations: CocoTown, HighStakesHill, Pranksyvania, PharaohIsland, BigBootyBay, FrontiersVille, RaccoonCity and finally Cosmopolis. It is revealed that Cosmopolis is a trap for "Anti-Alien-Forces" to capture all of the aliens on Earth by disguising themselves as aliens. Itazura uses their trap as the final challenge for Cosmi, and challenges him personally there. Cosmi wins and travels back to Planet Mischief to celebrate, but crashes into another TV-station and crashlands on Earth again, this time, in the middle of CocoTown square. Of course, panic arises and reporters try to get a snapshot of the little alien, but Cosmi accidentally pushes someones camera around, causing it to take a photo of the crowd, thus revealing that several of them are also aliens.</desc>

		<name>Unlimited Saga</name>
		<desc>"Unlimited SaGa" is a sequel to Square's famous series of non-linear RPGs. Like in the early Romancing Saga games, and in Saga Frontier, you assume the role of eight main characters (selectable at the beginning of the game). The story centers around Laura, a 30-year old widow and an ex-pirate, but you view the story and make it progress differently depending on which character you have chosen, and on the decisions you take throughout the game. Each character is represented by a different kind of flower. 
 
"Unlimited SaGa" feels and plays a lot like a classic board RPG. Everything - from disarming traps to hitting the enemy successfully in a battle - depends on the so-called REEL system. You have to stop a spinning slot machine at the right time, in order to perform an action successfully. It is similar to the classic dice system in pen-and-paper RPGs, and to the Judgment Ring system in Shadow Hearts. You can explore the world in a non-linear fashion, visit many optional areas and fight monsters at your will. Some puzzles have multiple solutions and can be solved by using a character's special skill. For example, a character with a Swim skill can cross a river and reach the next area of the game.</desc>

		<name>Vampire Night</name>
		<desc>Vampire Night is a light gun game produced by Sega's Wow Entertainment, distributed through Namco and released in 2000 for video game arcades. It was later ported to PlayStation 2 in November 2001. Two players can team up to take down on screen enemies. 
 
A struggle between light and dark, from 300 years back, is about to ensue. The parties involved are Michel and Albert, the two vampire hunters representing light, and the vampires representing dark. The story takes place in an alternate version of the year 2006 in France, when progress looks stuck in the late 19th century. 
 
Michel and Albert rescue a 12-year-old girl named Caroline who witnessed a couple of villagers held hostage by the vampire sarcoma. After rescuing the villagers and Caroline, the vampire hunters proceed into the castle to destroy the remaining forces of dark. 
 
Although the forces of evil reveal that they created Michel and Albert to kill themselves, they became afraid of death and tried to stop them. It is important to note the Hunters are in fact Dhampyrs (half-vampires), foreshadowed by their glowing eyes and sunglasses. The outcome is a pyrrhic victory for the forces of good; as the forces of evil are stopped, the Vampire Hunters decide to let the rising sun end their own lives as well. 
 
The game ends with Caroline paying her respects to the Vampire Hunters at their graves.</desc>

The game plays as a fighting game yet works differently than the traditional one-on-one structured rounds. Instead, fights can include up to 4 players in a four-way simultaneous fighting structure. The camera is in third person perspective, allowing the player to focus solely on their character. 
 
Monsters have two status bars in each game, health and stamina. Like the standard fighting game formula, every time a monster takes damage, their overall Health bar drops until it is completely depleted, resulting in player defeat. Stamina determines how much energy a monster can attack with. The bar drops if a monster picks up another foe or performs a ranged attack. If the bar is full, a monster can perform special attacks, whereas if the bar is completely drained, they become temporarily immobilized.</desc>

		<desc>Although Redmond (the rabbit) and Spanx (the weasel) are two animals chained together, the gameplay is much like any other platformer. The player controls only Spanx, using Redmond as a weapon or tool as the situation requires. Spanx has most standard platforming abilities, while Redmond is completely indestructible as a result of tests conducted upon him and so can be hurled into security guards, jammed into machinery, and used as a grappling hook, among other uses. Redmond can be inserted into special outlets to be set on fire, frozen, or become radioactive.</desc>

		<desc>Like the other titles in the series, WipEout Pulse is a futuristic racing game where players control a hovercraft-like vehicle that hovers above the ground and can reach very high speeds. The game is set in 2207 where players take part in the FX400 Anti-Gravity Racing League with courses all over the world. 
 
The vehicles are divided over different teams (twelve including downloads), each with their own characteristics based on handling, speed, acceleration and more. While racing, moving over pads provides boosts or both offensive and defensive power-ups such as shields, rockets, a wall of fire, autopilot, a gun or a turbo boost. Instead of using weapons, they can now also be absorbed to restore the energy levels. A single button is used to accelerate, with regular steering and also air brakes for sharp corners. The visuals are very fast and the soundtrack consists of mostly electronic tracks, a hallmark of the series.</desc>

		<desc>All of the action in Without Warning takes place over the course of a 12-hour period. Terrorists have infiltrated a chemical plant and a three-man team gets inside to take them down. Along the way there are three civilians that play a role in the operation as well. One is a security guard, another is a secretary, and the third is a cameraman who survived a crash in his news chopper after it was hit by a surface-to-air missile from the terrorists. The cameraman wants to get the story and survive while everyone else wants to get out of there and save as many hostages spread across the plant as possible. There are six playable characters in all, but the trick is that none of them really interact with each other directly. However, there will be several times where characters see others or the results of their actions during their own segment, such as seeing a firefight from afar.</desc>

		<desc>World Destruction League: Thunder Tanks is a car combat shooter game that has a similar gameplay to the Twisted Metal and Vigilante 8 series. Like Twisted Metal and Vigilante 8, the player must obtain "powerups" and defeat enemy vehicles, but must capture the enemy flags in order to win. However, all of the vehicles are tanks, hence its name. The game itself is short, making it quite unpopular among gamers. It was also one of the very first PlayStation 2 titles to be released. It is considered a spiritual successor to the Battletanx series, since it has similar gameplay to that as well, and is made by the same company, 3DO. Also a mototank from Battletanx: Global Assault can be seen in the opening title sequence, and many of the playable tanks are inspired or directly copied from Battletanx. A reversed M-80 (only in the PS1 version of Battletanx: Global Assault) can also be seen in game as the unplayable AI controlled Skorpion Bomb Tank.</desc>

		<path>./World Super Police (Europe).gz</path>
		<name>World Super Police</name>
		<desc>World Super Police is a single player police pursuit game. 
 
Gameplay here is virtually identical to games like Outrun, a series of games that started life on the DOS and Amiga platforms in the mid eighties. 
 
The story behind the game is that normal police cars cannot catch criminals in really fast cars so, in order to combat increasing car crime, the World Super Police (WSP) have been formed. There are two strands to this game, one based around the Blue Wing group (WSP Japan) and the other around Red Hawks (WSP USA). In each strand there is a story but the missions are basically the same, the player's car sits firmly in the centre of the screen at the bottom and the scenery rushes by. On the left of the screen is a vertical bar which gives a 'radar' view the road ahead 
The object is to keep the car on the road, travel as fast as possible avoiding other traffic, and take-out the bad guy with whatever weapons the player equipped their car(s) with. This involves racing for a minute or so until the target(s) show up on the radar at which point the felonious fiend must be stopped before they reach the border. Some missions are solo and unarmed, while in others the player is accompanied by fellow WSP in super cars and they can switch between offensive and defensive formations. 
 
The game's main menu also features a Training option which, unusually, is greyed out at the start of the game and can only be accessed once the player has completed one or more missions in either story. The menu also has a Royal Scramble option in which the player can replay old missions, naturally this too can only be accessed once the player has completed one or more missions</desc>

		<desc>The gameplay itself hasn't changed much from its predecessors, with the exception of the three-dimensional view, which allows the player more freedom, and more possibilities, to complete the task at hand. Modes like Campaign and Quick Match return from previous versions. The game also features a multiplayer feature, as well as the ability to edit and create teams. The objective of most of the matches is to eliminate the opposing forces' worms, whereas the Campaign mode gives the player sets of specific goals which he needs to complete. 
 
The campaign consists of 35 small missions in which the player has to utilise their worms to complete a certain task, like destroy enemy worms, collect a certain crate, or even unique missions, like having to detonate 16 hidden landmines in a certain time. All of the missions give awards depending on how well you do. Gold medals usually unlock bonuses as for example maps, challenge missions, infos about weapons or voice banks. In the challenge missions in you have to use a weapon/utility to collect targets that add to your timebank which increases steadily. Getting a gold medal here unlocks maps or locked weapons.</desc>

Missions are now ranked based on how quickly they are completed, and fast times reward medals. By completing a bonus objective on hard mode, such as destroying traffic, a bonus mission will be unlocked. Earning a gold medal in a bonus mission will further unlock a cheat code, like unlimited time or low gravity. A free mode is available now too, allowing the player to drive through the city without worrying about a time limit. Finally two new features have been added to the cars: an adrenaline feature that slows down time, and a limited supply of short-range missiles. 
 
A new multiplayer mode allows two players to play on a single screen, with the camera following the trailing player. Different modes are available, such as a mode where the trailing car attempts to ram the leading car, or a normal racing mode.</desc>

Similarly to versus fighters, the wrestling in the game is predominantly combo-based. The wrestler's signature moves are exaggerated, including nearly supernatural elements such as diving high into the air or slow motion moves. The game features popular WWE wrestlers from its time, such as Triple H, The Undertaker, Rey Mysterio, Big Show and John Cena, as well as WWF wrestlers from the past: Hulk Hogan, Bret Hart, The Ultimate Warrior, Jake the Snake and the "Macho Man" Randy Savage. 
 
The game includes a Path Of Champions mode, where players can choose a WWE Legend or Superstar to either become the WWE Champion, the World Heavyweight Champion, or the WWE Tag Team Champions.</desc>

		<desc>Despite what its title might imply, WWE Crush Hour is not a wrestling game. It takes the best wrestlers of World Wrestling Entertainment out of the usual ring of body slams and into an even bigger ring of rocket fire and engine fumes. 
 
The game has the WWE crew in their own combat vehicles, in battles of fire power and crazy stunts. The likes of The Rock and the Hardy Boys are represented, each with a varying amount of special attacks, weapons and moves under the hood of their vehicle. Simply dive head long into the battle and be the victor at the end. 
 
Game modes range from a simple defeat-the-enemy style to challenges that have the player character holding the championship belt for the longest amount of time without blowing up, or taking out the most opponents in the limited amount of time. Multiplayer support is also included.</desc>

		<desc>WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2011 is a professional wrestling video game that is based on the two brands of WWE, Raw and SmackDown. 
 
One of the main changes in the game is the incorporation of a new physics system that allows objects to be used more realistically, such as objects involved in the Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match. Tables now break differently depending on the impact placed upon them. Inside and outside the ring, ladders can now be rested onto the ring ropes and be broken in half. For the first time since the original WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw game, chairs can be thrown at your opponents. 
 
The Hell in a Cell match is revamped with expanded cell walls, weapons underneath the ring, steel steps near the poles, and the cell door is removed. In addition, the game adds new ways to escape the steel cage.</desc>

The game features real-life attributes of strength, submission, technique, speed and stamina for each wrestler. These new attributes allow players to wear down their opponents and take advantage of each Superstar's unique abilities and extensive move sets, expanding the amount of stances to sixteen (as opposed to four in the previous game). The presentation has been enhanced with new camera angles, superstar voiceovers, additional animations, and new arena and crowd elements.  
 
Players can create, play and develop their own superstar through various storylines staged by the WWE. New match types and modes are available as well. Players can track their progress with seasonal stats, earn money to build up superstar abilities, and unlock hidden features.</desc>

		<name>X-Men : Next Dimension</name>
		<desc>The control system of the game is heavily influenced by other popular fighting titles, such as Street Fighter, Dead or Alive, or Darkstalkers. The gameplay mechanics are tailored to a very gradual learning curve: super attacks are performed by pressing two punch or kick buttons simultaneously, and multi-hit combos can be executed by pressing the punch and kick buttons in a particular order (a feature similar to Darkstalkers' chain combos). The game features an extensive combo system, including normal chains, air juggles, and air launchers. In addition to the basic blocking system, players have various counter attacks available to them that can be executed by simply pressing the counterattack button and a direction on the controller. The counter-attacks are specific to the type of attack the player is countering. 
 
The fighting stages are fully 3-D rendered stages with their own layouts. As in Dead or Alive it is possible to knock an opponent to a different part of the stage, which functions as its own individual stage. In the X-Mansion, for example, an opponent can be knocked from the Hangar to the Hallway, then to the outer courtyard where, after the 2nd round, the basketball court opens up, allowing a player to be knocked back into the Hangar. 
 
While in Story Mode, only a limited set of characters are available for each battle; Arcade Mode allows you to select from any of the playable characters in a series of eight battles. The Two-Player Versus Mode also allows players to choose from any of the unlocked characters. The game also features a Survival Mode, in which a single player is pitted against a never-ending flow of computer-controlled opponents in a test of endurance.</desc>

Nightcrawler is asked to infiltrate the remnants of William Stryker's base with his teleportation ability, since the weapons systems were somehow operational. Once inside, he finds out that Stryker had a backup plan to destroy the mutants â€” mutant hunting robots called Sentinels. Working together, Storm and Wolverine find an A.I. module for a Sentinel when agents of HYDRA (an organization of terrorists) arrive to take the remaining Sentinels to their own base. It is revealed that HYDRA had designed the robots for Stryker. Inside the base, Wolverine discovers that HYDRA had employed one of his former adversaries â€” Lady Deathstrike, who was able to survive an apparent death in X2 after being pumped full of adamantium.</desc>

		<name>XII Stag</name>
		<desc>XII Stag is a vertical scrolling arcade shooter. The player controls a futuristic aircraft and tries to reach the end of each stage, where a boss fight waits. 
 
There are several different types of attacks: a regular shot, which can be upgraded five times by power-ups dropped by enemy ships; a side attack is a risky manoeuvre that involves pushing the control stick quickly left and right to destroy enemies to the left or right of the player's ship. This will also increase the score multiplier. The ship's exhaust can also be put to use by damaging enemies that come up from behind. The final weapon is the barrier, which creates a protective ring around the player, destroying all enemies that touch it. 
 
The game also features a difficulty setting adjusted dynamically by the score - the higher the player scores, the more difficult the game gets. XII Stag also has checkpoints in each level, which compare the current player's score to the high score at this point in the game.</desc>

		<name>Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monster Coliseum</name>
		<desc>This 3D board game consists of a series of duels, which are played with cards. The game has been split up in a Campaign Mode, in which you take on all levels of the Monster Coliseum on your own, a Free Battle Mode where you play skirmish matches against enemies defeated in the campaign, and a versus mode to take on a human opponent. Before starting, you have to choose a symbol, assign parameters to it (based on monster points, action points and power points) and buy a starter kit card deck. 
 
In a typical campaign game, you start in the entrance hall, where you manage your cards and monsters. To duel, you choose one of the four areas with five levels each, and defeat the opponents. New monsters are acquired by winning the match. The turn-based duels are played as a card game. Both characters start with a deck of cards and a number of health points. When a health status reaches zero, the battle is over. You attack your opponent by summoning monsters and assigning abilities to them. Trick cards can be used to gain both offensive and defensive advantages. Before each duel, you have to pick a monster that is up for ante, and the fighting is influenced by various parameters, including the land form you are playing on.</desc>

		<name>Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses</name>
		<desc>Loosely based on historical events that took place in England in the 15th century, known as the Wars of the Roses (a battle for power between the houses of Lancaster and York), Yu-Gi-Oh! The Duelists of the Roses sees the heroes of the Yu-Gi-Oh! manga and card game series, Yugi Muto and Seto Kaiba, assume the identity of the head of the Lancaster house (Red Rose, later the Tudor dynasty), Henry Tudor, and the leader of the Yorkist faction (White Rose), Christian Rosenkreuz, respectively. The player controls a Rose Duelist, who is initially sent by Henry Tudor (Yugi) and the Lancastrians to Stonehenge, with the mission of disrupting a barrier imposed by the White Rose forces. However, Rosenkreuz (Seto) arrives and offers the hero to side with the Yorkists. From that point on, the player can choose to follow either the Red or the White Rose, in two different scenarios.</desc>

You play in turn as either one of the brothers or the robot. Walter can melee combat with a wrench and shoot projectiles while Danny has a slingshot, and the robot can shoot lasers or a charged shot, and can charge an enemy and jump high. As they progress through the different levels cut-scenes advance the story. They can grab power-ups and need to fight boss enemies as well.</desc>
