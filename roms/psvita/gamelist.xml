What are you doing?

		<desc>Because of his success in the events at St. Theresia Academy, Kisaragi Shuuji (Shield 9) has obtained a firm position within Aegis. That is, as the one in charge of â€œCrossdress infiltrationâ€. Since the previous events he has successfully completed several more assignments, and currently considers stepping down from the position. Unfortunately for him however, he has been tasked with just 1 more assignment. This time, his task involves another all-girls school similar to St. Theresia Academy. He has to run in the elections for student council president and success in obtaining the position.

Shuuji himself considers the operation to be impossible. To infiltrate the school alone, and run in the elections that take place within just 2 months from now? Thereâ€™s no way that he can do it. Especially since apparently there are many dangers involved with the run for student council president. And who knows what other traps lurk within the shadows of the Academy? Will he manage to find his way through?</desc>

		<name>Muv-Luv</name>
		<desc>The Muv-Luv series is an epic saga told in three parts: Muv-Luv Extra, Muv-Luv Unlimited, and Muv-Luv Alternative. What begins as a tongue-in-cheek romantic comedy ultimately transforms into an action-packed thrill ride in a war-torn alternate reality, and its this drastic-yet-methodical genre twist that makes the final chapter the most highly-revered visual novel of all time. This is a story that will plant seeds in your brain early in the first act that you wont even notice until they sprout in the third for maximum narrative payoff and crushing emotional impact. Dont fall for Extras cutesy exterior. This series ventures into some of the darkest thematic territory youll ever see, and when the final curtain closes, youll likely need a forklift to pick your jaw up off the floor. Make no mistake: this is a story that will challenge you in ways few works of fiction dare attempt, and an emotional tour de force unlike any other.</desc>

With the city under the constant threat of Variants - genetically engineered monsters - and the emergence of portals leading to a mysterious dimension called the Abyss, the government has established a secret organization called the Code Physics Agency to investigate these mysterious phenomena. Operating under the guise of a private school called Hinowa Academy, the CPA recruits teenage youths to be part of the "Xion Transhuman (Xth) Squad." The CPA uses their Code technology to provide the Xth Squad with "Blood Codes", special Codes that contain the genomes of history's greatest heroes and bestow the Xth Squad with powerful abilities to combat the Variant menace. Using a team of six people, the player will map dungeons, evade traps, and face powerful monsters as they investigate the mystery behind the Variants and the Abyss.</desc>

		<name>Shinobido 2 Revenge of Zen</name>
		<desc>Shinobido 2: Revenge of Zen is a video game published by Spike in Japan in 2011 and Namco Bandai Games in North America and the PAL region in 2012. It was developed by Acquire, authors of the Tenchu and Way of the Samurai series, as a sequel to Shinobido: Way of the Ninja and Shinobido: Tales of the Ninja. Players take the role of one of the two main characters, Zen and Kaede. The main town features various menus. Some allow players to equip ninja tools such as caltrops, mines, shurikens, potions, smoke bombs, etc., while others let them accept missions from the three primary daimyou. As they progress through the story, players have the choice of which daimyou they want to help, and they are encouraged to only help that daimyou, encouraging three separate playthroughs. The daimyou issue various missions such as assassinating a certain target, protecting a shipping crate with supplies, freeing captive peasants, or stealing resources. Once a mission is selected, players are dropped into a map filled with enemies and treasures to collect. They must utilize stealth and a variety of skills such as a grapple hook, silent assassinations, counter attacks, etc., in order to complete their objective. Once they level up, they can put attribute points into max health, attack, defense, an extended special attack meter that allows for the Zankoku attack (a teleporting silent kill), and a longer grapple hook. Along the way, players will encounter various bosses, such as enemy ninja clan leaders, and eventually the other daimyou themselves. Players can utilize items to weaken their foes or try to lure them into a silent kill, allowing for a wide variety of play-styles.</desc>

		<desc>From the dungeon crawling geniuses behind Demon Gaze, this new title takes a decidedly more Western approach to the traditional dungeon crawler and infuses the game with dark fantasy themes, new gameplay elements, and the ability to compete with fellow players through a leaderboard system. At its core it's a game about death and fighting against vanishing forever. You will discover new meaning in the choices you make to survive against all odds. You will define yourself by the lives of those you leave behind, by the people you align yourself with, and the experiences you have on each new venture into the dark labyrinths that threaten to trap you. Your flight crashes after passing through a mysterious portal. As the sole survivor, you awaken to an unfamiliar land lit by stars you've never seen. This land is Escario, the city of swords. Quickly marked as the Chosen One, the Stranger of Sword City, you must defend this place, and choose your allegiances carefully as you scour the land for a way home.

		<path>./Super Star Wars.cmd</path>
		<name>Super Star Wars</name>
		<desc>Super Star Wars generally follows the plot of Star Wars, although some allowances were made to adapt the story to suit an action game. For example, instead of simply buying C-3PO and R2-D2 from the Jawas, Luke Skywalker must fight his way to the top of a Jawa sandcrawler while leaping from a series of moving conveyor belts. Brief cutscenes between levels tell an abbreviated version of the film's story through written text. Later stages allow the player to control smuggler and pilot Han Solo or Chewbacca the Wookiee. The game also features several vehicle-based levels in which the player takes control of an X-Wing or a landspeeder.

Most of the stages consist of run and gun and platforming gameplay, with several different upgrades available to the standard blaster weapon. Luke can also wield a lightsaber after acquiring it from Obi Wan Kenobi. The end of the game has players reenacting Luke's Death Star trench run to destroy the Death Star, with Darth Vader confronting the player in his TIE Advanced x1.</desc>

In the game, players control a human child who has fallen into the Underground, a large, secluded region underneath the surface of the Earth, separated by a magic barrier. The player meets various monsters during a quest to return to the surface, mainly through the combat system; the player navigates through mini-bullet hell attacks by the opponent, and can opt to pacify or subdue monsters in order to spare them instead of murdering them. These choices affect the game, with the dialogue, characters, and story changing based on outcomes.</desc>

		<desc>There's something terrible wrong in an alternate dimension! Help Captain Viridian flip to find five crew members, 20 hard-to-reach Trinkets and save a dimension on the brink of destruction. It's a space opera in the most unique scale with a style that only VVVVVV can bring to you. Instead of jumping, control the direction of gravity by inverting your gravity and allowing Captain Viridian to flip between the floors and ceilings of the environment.

For adventurers who save the dimension, there's still hours and hours of new gameplay with all-new Player Levels. Test your mettle and see if you have what it takes to beat a collection of levels created by other famous game developers.

Inspired by classic 8-bit days gone-by and now with experience-heightening 3D, VVVVVV will challenge even the most battle-hardened old-school gamers.</desc>

		<desc>Following a devastating demonic invasion, the twin Goddesses use their magic to bring the inhabitants of legendary Ys safely into the sky. While the demons work to construct the Devil's Tower and reach the humans' new abode, the Goddesses disappear. As a mighty warrior or a cunning mage, you must seek the Goddesses in Devil's Tower. With your swordsmanship and spells, can you banish evil from the land of your ancestors?

700 years before the events of Ys I &amp; II, the land of Ys was on the brink of destruction. Demons came in droves and forced the twin Goddesses who ruled the land to whisk their subjects away from the surface, into the safe embrace of the clouds. The demons were persistent, however, erecting a massive tower in pursuit. The battle that raged upon the ground had begun ascending for a second round up above.</desc>
