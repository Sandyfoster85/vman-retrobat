What are you doing?

The goal of Coconut Dodge Revitalized is to collect as many treasures as possible, while avoiding getting hit three times by falling coconuts. To do this, move Clawrence back and forth along the bottom of the screen, choosing between three different speeds for the crab.
If you die, you have to start over from the beginning, and everything repeats almost exactly the same way each time.</desc>

Futuridium EP Deluxe is a psychedelic retro inspired shootâ€™em up with a modern twist, that blends together frantic action, puzzle elements, a vibrant low poly aesthetic and an heart pumping electronic soundtrack. As a lone starship pilot lost in a dimensional loop just before a big space battle, with a limited and constantly depleting energy tank, your only hope is to fly as fast as possible over enormous space dreadnoughts, destroying their defenses and the cyan power cubes to get some energy back.

		<desc>Because of his success in the events at St. Theresia Academy, Kisaragi Shuuji (Shield 9) has obtained a firm position within Aegis. That is, as the one in charge of â€œCrossdress infiltrationâ€. Since the previous events he has successfully completed several more assignments, and currently considers stepping down from the position. Unfortunately for him however, he has been tasked with just 1 more assignment. This time, his task involves another all-girls school similar to St. Theresia Academy. He has to run in the elections for student council president and success in obtaining the position.

Shuuji himself considers the operation to be impossible. To infiltrate the school alone, and run in the elections that take place within just 2 months from now? Thereâ€™s no way that he can do it. Especially since apparently there are many dangers involved with the run for student council president. And who knows what other traps lurk within the shadows of the Academy? Will he manage to find his way through?</desc>

		<name>Muv-Luv</name>
		<desc>The Muv-Luv series is an epic saga told in three parts: Muv-Luv Extra, Muv-Luv Unlimited, and Muv-Luv Alternative. What begins as a tongue-in-cheek romantic comedy ultimately transforms into an action-packed thrill ride in a war-torn alternate reality, and its this drastic-yet-methodical genre twist that makes the final chapter the most highly-revered visual novel of all time. This is a story that will plant seeds in your brain early in the first act that you wont even notice until they sprout in the third for maximum narrative payoff and crushing emotional impact. Dont fall for Extras cutesy exterior. This series ventures into some of the darkest thematic territory youll ever see, and when the final curtain closes, youll likely need a forklift to pick your jaw up off the floor. Make no mistake: this is a story that will challenge you in ways few works of fiction dare attempt, and an emotional tour de force unlike any other.</desc>

With the city under the constant threat of Variants - genetically engineered monsters - and the emergence of portals leading to a mysterious dimension called the Abyss, the government has established a secret organization called the Code Physics Agency to investigate these mysterious phenomena. Operating under the guise of a private school called Hinowa Academy, the CPA recruits teenage youths to be part of the "Xion Transhuman (Xth) Squad." The CPA uses their Code technology to provide the Xth Squad with "Blood Codes", special Codes that contain the genomes of history's greatest heroes and bestow the Xth Squad with powerful abilities to combat the Variant menace. Using a team of six people, the player will map dungeons, evade traps, and face powerful monsters as they investigate the mystery behind the Variants and the Abyss.</desc>

		<name>Stranger of Sword City</name>
		<desc>From the dungeon crawling geniuses behind Demon Gaze, this new title takes a decidedly more Western approach to the traditional dungeon crawler and infuses the game with dark fantasy themes, new gameplay elements, and the ability to compete with fellow players through a leaderboard system. At its core it's a game about death and fighting against vanishing forever. You will discover new meaning in the choices you make to survive against all odds. You will define yourself by the lives of those you leave behind, by the people you align yourself with, and the experiences you have on each new venture into the dark labyrinths that threaten to trap you. Your flight crashes after passing through a mysterious portal. As the sole survivor, you awaken to an unfamiliar land lit by stars you've never seen. This land is Escario, the city of swords. Quickly marked as the Chosen One, the Stranger of Sword City, you must defend this place, and choose your allegiances carefully as you scour the land for a way home.

		<path>./Super Star Wars.cmd</path>
		<name>Super Star Wars</name>
		<desc>Super Star Wars generally follows the plot of Star Wars, although some allowances were made to adapt the story to suit an action game. For example, instead of simply buying C-3PO and R2-D2 from the Jawas, Luke Skywalker must fight his way to the top of a Jawa sandcrawler while leaping from a series of moving conveyor belts. Brief cutscenes between levels tell an abbreviated version of the film's story through written text. Later stages allow the player to control smuggler and pilot Han Solo or Chewbacca the Wookiee. The game also features several vehicle-based levels in which the player takes control of an X-Wing or a landspeeder.

Most of the stages consist of run and gun and platforming gameplay, with several different upgrades available to the standard blaster weapon. Luke can also wield a lightsaber after acquiring it from Obi Wan Kenobi. The end of the game has players reenacting Luke's Death Star trench run to destroy the Death Star, with Darth Vader confronting the player in his TIE Advanced x1.</desc>

		<desc>Undertale is a role-playing video game created by American indie developer and composer Toby Fox. 

In the game, players control a human child who has fallen into the Underground, a large, secluded region underneath the surface of the Earth, separated by a magic barrier. The player meets various monsters during a quest to return to the surface, mainly through the combat system; the player navigates through mini-bullet hell attacks by the opponent, and can opt to pacify or subdue monsters in order to spare them instead of murdering them. These choices affect the game, with the dialogue, characters, and story changing based on outcomes.</desc>

		<desc>After the horrors have ended at Hope's Peak Academy, society is on the verge of collapse and violent anarchy has engulfed the whole world in despair! Danganronpa Another Episode: Ultra Despair Girls is the pre-sequel to the highly popular mystery adventure game Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair. Unlike the first two games, players will take on the role of two heroines, Komaru Naegi and Toko Fukawa, as they are thrust into a despair-ridden Towa City with one goal-escape. Komaru Naegi, little sister to Makoto Naegi, has been imprisoned inside a mysterious apartment for over a year. One day, she is rescued by Byakuya Togami of Future Foundation, but the rescue is derailed by a sudden attack of hundreds of Monokumas. Komaru soon discovers that the city has been taken over by a group of children calling themselves the Warriors of Hope. Their leader, Monaca, declares that the city will be the site of a Children's Paradise, and to accomplish this, all the adults will be exterminated. Komaru teams up with Toko Fukawa to try to survive the rampaging Monokumas, escape the crafty Monokuma Kids, and uncover the secrets of the city.

Developer QUByte Interactive took inspiration from all of the the unforgetable notes from that game style to proudly bring you "99Vidas".

"99Vidas" is a brawler set in a contemporary world, but that pays tribute to both the classic and the new in the gaming industry. Brought to you in 16-bit pixelated glory, chock-full of references to not only gaming but also 80's and 90's pop culture. "99Vidas" takes full advantage modern era gameplay mechanics, making it the best of both worlds.

6 stages (with more to come) will take you on a journey to different parts of the world to face hordes of fierce enemies and relentless bosses, but you don't have to do it alone: you can face this challenge with up to 3 other players in co-op play, both local and online.</desc>

		<name>Shinobido 2 Revenge of Zen</name>
		<desc>Shinobido 2: Revenge of Zen is a video game published by Spike in Japan in 2011 and Namco Bandai Games in North America and the PAL region in 2012. It was developed by Acquire, authors of the Tenchu and Way of the Samurai series, as a sequel to Shinobido: Way of the Ninja and Shinobido: Tales of the Ninja. Players take the role of one of the two main characters, Zen and Kaede. The main town features various menus. Some allow players to equip ninja tools such as caltrops, mines, shurikens, potions, smoke bombs, etc., while others let them accept missions from the three primary daimyou. As they progress through the story, players have the choice of which daimyou they want to help, and they are encouraged to only help that daimyou, encouraging three separate playthroughs. The daimyou issue various missions such as assassinating a certain target, protecting a shipping crate with supplies, freeing captive peasants, or stealing resources. Once a mission is selected, players are dropped into a map filled with enemies and treasures to collect. They must utilize stealth and a variety of skills such as a grapple hook, silent assassinations, counter attacks, etc., in order to complete their objective. Once they level up, they can put attribute points into max health, attack, defense, an extended special attack meter that allows for the Zankoku attack (a teleporting silent kill), and a longer grapple hook. Along the way, players will encounter various bosses, such as enemy ninja clan leaders, and eventually the other daimyou themselves. Players can utilize items to weaken their foes or try to lure them into a silent kill, allowing for a wide variety of play-styles.</desc>
