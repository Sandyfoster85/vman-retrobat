		<name>Half-Life 2</name>
		<desc>1998. HALF-LIFE sends a shock through the game industry with its combination of pounding action and continuous, immersive storytelling. Valve's debut title wins more than 50 game-of-the-year awards on its way to being named "Best PC Game Ever" by PC Gamer, and launches a franchise with more than eight million retail units sold worldwide.NOW. By taking the suspense, challenge and visceral charge of the original, and adding startling new realism and responsiveness, Half-Life 2 opens the door to a world where the player's presence affects everything around them, from the physical environment to the behaviors even the emotions of both friends and enemies.The player again picks up the crowbar of research scientist Gordon Freeman, who finds himself on an alien-infested Earth being picked to the bone, its resources depleted, its populace dwindling. Freeman is thrust into the unenviable role of rescuing the world from the wrong he unleashed back at Black Mesa. And a lot of people he cares about are counting on him.</desc>

		<path>./The Fall.lnk</path>
		<name>The Fall</name>
		<desc>The Fall is the first game in a trilogy where the protagonist is artificial intelligence called A.R.I.D. It is part of a high-tech combat suit worn by a character called Colonel Josephs and uses a female voice. It activates itself after crashing on an unknown planet and since the user of the suit does not respond, her routines immediately kick in, and she seeks medical attention to save the pilot. Since the AI has full access to the suit functions, she can take over control. The game is played in a 2D side-scrolling environment. The suit can be moved left or right and it can jump as well. The environment can be examined using a flash light where the beam can be guided in any direction. It highlights interactive parts of the world, which can then be interacted with. Interactions include conversations with multiple dialog options, interacting with computers and tools, examining the environment and picking up objects. Most of the game however is based around puzzle-solving. It is story-driven and often focuses on how ARID struggles with her internal instructions combined with the directive to save the pilot. In some situations this shows her inability for nuance or lies. A Caretaker who now controls the facility sees her as faulty and aims to refurbish her. A large part of the game for instance shows how ARID needs to pass tests in unique ways to show her proficiency as a household robot, to show her willingness to comply. There are also many other dangers next to the Caretaker, such as security robots, fish, slugs and poisonous fungi. Much of the story and the facility's background is revealed through notes and conversations with computer systems.</desc>

The time is set somewhere in the near future, and there is a major war active on your planet. By the time war is battling, the infamous and most dangerous international prisoner was rescued, and the prison guards were killed.

As you can guess by the title, most action is taken under the water, and a few rare are battled in the space above. Bring him back commander!</desc>

After meeting Alyx Vance, Freeman is instructed by Kleiner to step into a makeshift teleporter so that he can be safely extracted to the anti-Combine resistance base Black Mesa East along with Alyx, headed by her father, Dr. Eli Vance. However, Kleiner's pet headcrab Lamarr disrupts the machine, and Freeman finds himself — after briefly appearing in several different locations — just outside Kleiner's lab. With the Combine now alerted to his presence, Freeman works his way through the drained canal system, avoiding enemy forces and using the help of human resistance fighters  to safely arrive at Black Mesa East.</desc>

		<name>Star Wars - Rogue Squadron 3D</name>
		<desc>Star Wars: Rogue Squadron (known as Star Wars: Rogue Squadron 3D on the PC) is an arcade-style action game co-developed by Factor 5 and LucasArts. The first of three games in the Rogue Squadron series, it was published by LucasArts and Nintendo and released for Windows and the Nintendo 64 in December 1998. Rogue Squadron was one of the first games to take advantage of the Nintendo 64's Expansion Pak, which allows gameplay at a 640 × 480 display resolution, instead of that system's standard 320 × 240 resolution. Set in the fictional Star Wars galaxy and inspired by the Star Wars: X-wing Rogue Squadron comics, the game takes place primarily between events in the films Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back. The player controls Luke Skywalker, commander of the elite X-wing pilots known as Rogue Squadron. As the game progresses, Skywalker and Rogue Squadron fight the Galactic Empire in sixteen missions across various planets. Rogue Squadron received generally positive reviews. Critics praised the game's technical achievements and flight controls, but its use of distance fog and the lack of a multiplayer mode drew criticism. The game's sales exceeded expectations; by August 1999, more than one million copies had sold worldwide. It spawned two sequels developed and released for the Nintendo GameCube—Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader and Star Wars Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike—as well as Star Wars: Episode I: Battle for Naboo, a spiritual successor released for Windows and Nintendo 64.</desc>

		<name>Giana Sisters 2D</name>
		<desc>"The Great Giana Sisters" was one of the first platformers to be released on the Commodore 64. Although sales were stopped soon after the game’s release, The Great Giana Sisters became a cult classic, and Giana an iconic part of video game history.
In 2009, we started a reboot of Giana Sisters and released it on Nintendo DS. Giana Sisters DS marked the beginning of a new series of Giana Sisters games, with Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams and Giana Sisters: Dream Runners being the latest releases.
Now we’re happy to give you a HD remake of the 2009 Nintendo DS version on Steam. It features beautiful HD graphics and full controller support. And of course the precise controls, intuitive handling and a smooth learning curve that platform fans expect. All balanced for hours of fun and challenges. It also contains the 32 levels of the original game – restored with love and care to resemble our take on the retro aesthetic.</desc>

Run and jump, dash and smash, daze and teleport, morph and cannon… oh you get the idea: mess with your opponents!

The game pits up to four players (or AI opponents) against each other in local and online competition, speed-running for the finish in an effort to push each other off the screen with the help of boosters and power-ups.
Switch the level layout on the fly as you rush through dreamgates. Collect gems to fill your speed booster and use your power-ups to knock out the other players and claim victory!</desc>

		<name>Maniac Mansion 2 : Day of the Tentacle</name>
		<desc>Purple Tentacle, one of the crazy Dr. Fred's creations, drinks contaminated water from Dr. Fred's Sludge-o-matic. He mutates into an insane genius and grows arms, and now he's plotting to take over the world. In an effort to stop him, Dr. Fred sends three friends, Bernard, Hoagie and Laverne back in time to yesterday, in order for them to turn off the Sludge-o-matic and stop the sludge from spilling into the river, thus preventing the whole incident. Naturally, the cheap doctor uses a fake diamond over a real one in his time machine, which blows up sending Hoagie 200 years into the past and Laverne 200 years into the future.

Now you must bring back Hoagie and Laverne, with the help of the time machine's ability to move objects between time periods, and then stop evil Purple from taking over the world.

Day of the Tentacle is a point-and-click adventure game and a sequel to Maniac Mansion. The player controls Bernard, and later also Hoagie and Laverne, being able to switch between them at any time. By using the commands at the bottom of the screen, the character can pick up items, use them on other things, talk to people and more. Any of the three friends can also send his items across time to another friend. 

The game takes place in the same building, but in three different eras, and thus affecting history takes a vital part in some puzzles. For instance, Hoagie can hide a bottle of wine in the XVIIIth century, and Laverne discovers the bottle in the XXIIIth century - but by then, the wine has already turned into vinegar.</desc>

		<path>./Black Mesa.lnk</path>
		<name>Black Mesa Definitive Edition</name>
		<desc>Black Mesa is a first-person shooter video game, developed and published by Crowbar Collective. It is a third-party remake of Half-Life (1998) in the Source game engine. Originally published as a free mod in September 2012, the game was given approval by Valve (the developers of Half-Life) for a commercial release. The commercial version was first published as an early access title in May 2015 and had its full release in March 2020 for Microsoft Windows and Linux.

Black Mesa was developed in response to Half-Life: Source (2005), Valve's port of Half-Life to the Source engine, which lacked new features or improvements. The project was formed by the merging of two separate teams that wanted to improve on the Source remake, eventually becoming Crowbar Collective. While they had originally targeted a release by 2009, the team realized they had rushed to this point, and reevaluated their efforts to improve the quality of the remake.

Since then, attention to details, adapting the game to an improved version of the Source engine, and completely reworking the oft-derided final chapters of Half-Life known as Xen had lengthened the development efforts into the remake. Due to its long development time, the modification became notable for its delays on the status of its completion. Among major changes in the remake include reskinned collection of textures, models, and NPCs; a longer runtime; improved level and puzzle design along with challenging enemy artificial intelligence, and additional dialogue and story elements.

Black Mesa received positive reviews upon its initial release and was lauded as the game was updated and improved. Praise was directed towards the gameplay and attention to detail, comparing it to that of an official Valve release, as well as for the improvements they had made on the Xen chapters.</desc>

		<name>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2</name>
		<desc>What happens when two classic puzzle games collide? Culture shock, and lots of it! That's what the characters of the Puyo Puyo series find themselves in when a whole host of crazy characters claiming to be Tetris masters crash into the Puyoverse. And it's not only Tetris they want to play - they also claim to be pretty good at Puyo popping! Can these two brainteasers co-exist without driving each other crazy?

Puyo Puyo Tetris is a combination of the Puyo Puyo and Tetris series in which the player battles through seven chapters of 10 stages each, playing as a total of 26 characters in the hopes of determining which puzzle game series is the better of the two. As usual, the objective is to score chains and drown opponents in a wave of Nuisance Puyos and/or extra blocks. But the rules change every time - one match might have the player(s) swapping between Puyo Puyo and Tetris fields, while another may allow them to use items to hinder opponents' progress. Also, at certain points, the player will encounter challenges, where the objective is to reach a certain goal before time runs out.

The traditional battle mode is of course still intact, with up to 4 players battling for Puyo (or Tetris, or who knows? Maybe both) bragging rights.</desc>

Remappable keys with three profiles to choose from: original controls, custom controls, and lefthanded controls. Some original game bugs fixed. Gameplay features: Rocket through cyberspace to steal information, hack security and grapple with watchdog defense programs enslaved to a maniacal computer. Survive battle after battle against armies of killer cyborgs and deadly robots as you collect hardware attachments, life-sustaining patches and deadly weapons to combat mindless mutants. Test your intelligence by solving puzzles, rewiring access panels and outwitting SHODAN in its own cyber-realm. Enjoy the vastly improved controls and graphics of the Enhanced Edition - or keep your experience as close to the original as possible with the Classic version.</desc>

		<name>Warcraft - Orcs and Humans</name>
		<desc>The Kingdom of Azeroth was relatively peaceful and ruled by King Llane. That was until a powerful mage named Medivh commanded forces that opened up a portal in the Swamp of Sorrow, leading to another world. This ushered in the Age of Chaos, as Orcs were summoned to this world and attempted to establish an empire. As the Orcish hordes swarmed from the portal, they met with the Humans of Azeroth and battles ensured. Peaceful co-existence is not an option. Only one race will attain dominance over the land. Warcraft: Orcs and Humans is the first real-time fantasy strategy game from Blizzard Entertainment. By playing either the Humans or the Orcs in this saga, two separate story lines evolve with 12 scenarios per side telling the tale of the battle for Azeroth. Players must mine gold and chop wood in order to construct buildings and create new units. From swords to sorcery, all the elements of classic fantasy are here to explore: rich forests, dark dungeons and bubbling swamps await the stalwart troops amassed to fight for dominance. Command many unique armies and creatures including Knights, Archers, Clerics, Warlocks, Daemons, Elementals, and Necromancers who are able to raise the dead. The multiplayer aspects of the game allow 2 players to challenge one another on over 20 custom maps and determine who is the supreme warlord. Head to head play is supported over modem, serial link, and IPX networks, and works cross-platform between the IBM-PC and Macintosh versions.</desc>

		<desc>Daggerfall is a sequel to The Elder Scrolls: Arena; it is set in the same medieval fantasy world Tamriel - more specifically, in the homeland of the Breton race, known as High Rock, and the province Hammerfell, home of the Redguards. The game's title is derived from the name of High Rock's capital city. The main protagonist travels to Daggerfall at the request of the emperor Uriel Septim. His mission involves freeing the ghost of the late King Lysandus. Like its predecessor, Daggerfall is an open-ended role-playing game, in which the main quest is but a small fraction of the various missions and assignments the player is able to undertake. The game is notable for breaking records concerning the size of its world (though much of it has been generated randomly). Interaction with hundreds of thousands of non-playable characters is possible.</desc>

In Shine City, the anti-gravity ball game has long been illegal. The group who kept playing was dubbed the Lethal League. Even now, with their sport pushed underground, players and crews compete in the League for challenge and respect. In the game, the goal is to beat your opponents with the ball. You can manipulate the ball to get the perfect angle and use your character's special moves to surprise them. But every strike speeds up the ball or even doubles its speed, up to shatteringly extreme velocities. You can tag the ball to your color, but on those high speeds the tables are quickly turned. You can play locally with friends and foes.</desc>

		<desc>Rad is a rambunctious but spirited young boy who maybe plays too many video games. After dozing off at the tail end of a long night of gaming, Rad awakens to find his dusty old console has turned itself back on. Suddenly a vortex emerges and he's sucked into his TV, where he finds himself the star in his very own video game adventure. Dusty is Rad's good-hearted but foul-mouthed, now-sentient game console. His clock speed isn't what it used to be, but what he lacks for in megahertz he makes up for with experience and attitude! Rad and Dusty's adventure begins in the First World, taking them through seven dangerous stages of action-packed, humor-filled, hardcore platforming fun. This decaying jungle world has been infected by a fierce corruption, and it's up to the unlikely buddy-duo Rad and Dusty to save the jungle's inhabitants and restore the Elder Tree as guardian of the land. Weapons: Dusty arms Rad with a variety of radical bad-ass weaponry. The Bolt Blaster has unlimited ammo, is easy to use, and more than enough firepower to get the job done. The Phoenix Cannon shoots out a fiery bird whose wingspan lights enemies ablaze as it flies by. There are 5+ weapons in this first chapter, with more to come. Sounds and Music: Our composer Andrew Hulshult combined his years of musical experience (both performing and writing) with his passion for retro-style gaming to create an amazing and authentic soundtrack for the game complete with MIDI-inspired music... And synthesizers! The Pixelverse: While Rad and Dusty are a great team, only Dusty can enter the electrified Pixelverse -- a dangerous spacetime-breaking region that exists behind the game world. Dusty enters the Pixelverse when necessary to repair glitches in the running game world, allowing both Rad and Dusty to continue their journey. Classic Easter Eggs: The game features hard-to-find collectibles in sometimes even harder-to-find classic secret rooms. Use your precision platforming skills to collect 'em all.</desc>

It is a story of simple emotions we all know so well and value more than sometimes we dare to admit: love and hope, longing and uncertainty, ultimately loss and sacrifice we are willing to make to save the ones we care the most for. Embark on the adventure of an extraordinary family of heroes. With the Corruption spreading through the land, guardians of the Mountain Morta have to stand up against the ancient evil. But... it's not a story about saving the universe. It’s a story about a valiant family standing together while the world around them is being devoured by darkness.</desc>

Playing as a teenage protagonist, you must venture into the Fallow — an ever-changing, radioactive wasteland filled with unknown and unspeakable creatures. But humanity’s future comes at great personal cost, as the deeper you journey into unknown lands, the more you will expose yourself to gnarly toxins which will wreak havoc on your fragile human form. The fate of the world depends on you, your trusty bat, and whatever strange new abilities you gain as the world around you ravages your body — twisting and mutating you into something far less than human, but far more powerful. But forget all that — go grab that sweet bat and help save the world…or what’s remaining of it anyway!</desc>

Like its predecessor Retro City Rampage, it is a parody of multiple subjects, including retro games, 1980s pop culture, manipulative business practices, and Grand Theft Auto and similar games. Shakedown: Hawaii was released for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita on May 7, 2019. Shakedown: Hawaii features an open world island with 16-bit style graphics, a top-down perspective, over 200 accessible buildings, and a destructible environment. In addition to a story mode following the three main characters, the player can break away from missions to free-roam the map and extort local businesses, use a variety of weapons to cause chaos, attempt arcade-like challenges and mini-games, purchase real-estate in a market that fluctuates in response, steal cars, or purchase clothing from stores. Combat is similar to Retro City Rampage, and involves using a wide variety of weapons to destroy enemies, vehicles, and property.</desc>

		<name>Batbarian - Testament of the Primordials</name>
		<desc>*Crash* ...That was the sound of you landing face first in an abyss filled with monsters, traps, and eldritch secrets. But hey, it's ok barbarian, you are not alone: Pip, your best friend -and mysteriously luminous bat- is with you. And it's only by truly working together that you'll be able to solve the abyss' puzzles, fight off its hungry denizens, discover its true purpose and maybe -just maybe- make it out alive with the secrets of the primordials. Key Features • Gain new skills for your barbarian and elemental powers for Pip, the (magic) bat! • A narrative-driven metroidvania with dialogue choices and plenty of humor and snark. • Big numbers! 400+ rooms, 20+ hours of evolving gameplay, 10+ bosses, 60+ minutes of music and almost 30,000 words of text that a barbarian would never bother to read! • Puzzles. • RPG elements with a level-up minigame. • Contains more fruit throwing than probably any other game. • Companions that join you in your quest and help you out in fights. • Multiple endings based on your choices and actions. • The thrown fruit are NOT wasted, they are eaten by the bat (who is magic). • A ton of secrets and hidden loot just about everywhere. • The (magic) bat has a whopping FIVE different squeaking sounds! • Fewer repetitive jokes than this description has.</desc>

		<name>Big Drunk Satanic Massacre</name>
		<desc>BDSM is the first satirical action RPG where you get to play Lou, Satan’s son! Get some milk, kill the traitors, save Hell and rescue the hottest demoness from the clutches of those nasty people and mega-corporations! Big Drunk Satanic Massacre is basically a shooter with strong RPG elements - not that rocket propelled gun, though. The game itself takes place in Hell where the main hero, Lou, is to find milk and rescue the hottest Mistress from the clutches of a fat clown. The game consists of four levels / chapters representing different areas of Hell, such as the hellish Big Wac fast food café, Skeleton Slums and the Red Light District. The idea behind those levels is to kill specific bosses. Each boss represents a unique multistage fight and it is pretty challenging. The player has to choose between six weapons and one magical ability. The main feature of the game is that Lou is healed by milk. The more he drinks, the more his blood milk level increases, which is sort of good for him.</desc>

		<name>Mutant Football League - Dynasty Edition</name>
		<desc>Mutants and monsters unleash maniacal carnage on the gridiron in THIS action packed, arcade-style football game. Mutant Football League delivers intense online multiplayer action, deep strategy and deadly humor. Fantastical arenas full of ruthless fans and deadly traps set the stage for mayhem in every contest that allows players to win by highest score or by killing and eradicating their opponents - a feat made easier as teams use their unique “Dirty Tricks” such as “Bribe the Ref” to overturn a call or having a player become “Ginormous” to grow in size and pummel the puny combatants in their path. Whenever a game begins you’ll quickly discover the only predictable element is broken bones. Mutant Football League is the bloody-fun, next-gen, successor to arcade-style American football games, taking inspiration from over-the-top sports games such as NFL Blitz and the Sega Genesis classic, Mutant League Football. Digital Dreams' MFL game delivers deep strategic 7-on-7 gameplay, with bone-crunching, tooth-shattering, head splitting hits, and a roster of comical ghouls delivering tongue-through-cheek humor. Oh, and blood. Lots of blood.</desc>

		<name>Robocop</name>
		<desc>Robocop places you in the titanium-coated-with-kevlar boots of Alex Murphy, killed in the line of duty and resurrected as the cyborg officer Robocop. The 2003 game features a new plot not featured in any of the films. Crime is up in Neo-Detroit due to the rapid proliferation of a new designer drug "Brain Drain," and the efforts of crime lord William Nexx to control its profitable distribution. Meanwhile, a mayoral race is heating up and getting dirty. And of course, mega-corporation OCP's role in all this is almost certain, but unclear. Robocop will have to get to the bottom of all of these mysteries through 9 missions. Gameplay is handled as a typical first-person-shooter, with various Robocop enhancements. His HUD is projected on screen and points out available targets. The player can mark up to three targets with a lock-on button, who Robo will then auto-aim at in sequence. Thermal vision can be activated to see through walls in a limited distance. Multiple weapons are also available, from the signature automatic pistol, to missile launchers and energy weapons. Objectives are given for each mission, from rescuing hostages to finding clues. Clues can be examined after each mission to explore the story (also updated through TV news breaks, in the style of the films). If the player can target and shoot a enemy's pistol, they will surrender and can be arrested. Should the player kill a hostage or surrendered enemy, they will take damage, forcing the player to follow Robocop's ethics and "prime directives."</desc>

Now he is on a rampage for taking the power of guardians and breaking the balance of elements. New heroes arrive to rise up against his madness with the help of the destroyer and the vanquisher, other two playable characters from the first game. Many elements from the original hack-and-slash RPG Torchlight (fishing, pets, etc) make a return in the sequel, including the randomly generated dungeons. There are more classes, pets and weapon types and the locations to visit are more varied. There are now snowy areas, deserts, forests etc. Instead of the dungeon descending structure of the original game, the sequel has large above-ground environments with hub towns and each one has a couple of separate dungeons that consist of one floor or multiple ones. Unlike the first game multiplayer is now supported through cooperative sessions for up to six players, both locally and online. There are three acts and an epilogue. Other new elements are time of day cycles, an updated interface design, and various weather effects. The character appearance can be fully customized based on various attributes.</desc>

The game seamlessly integrates thoughtful strategic planning into a fast-paced action experience, melding responsive gameplay and rich atmospheric storytelling. During the course of the adventure, players will piece together the Transistor's mysteries as they pursue its former owners. Red, a famous singer in a city called Cloudbank, is attacked by the Process, a robotic force commanded by a group called the Camerata. During the clash, she is transported all the way across Cloudbank and comes into possession of the mysterious Transistor- the greatsword-like weapon she was to be assassinated with. The Transistor is buried into the chest of an unnamed man, now slumped over and dead; though his consciousness and voice seems to have been absorbed into the Transistor itself, along with Red's voice. The Camerata continues to track Red and the Transistor down with the Process, wanting the weapon for some yet-unknown cause.</desc>

Using your advanced space fighter, you must repel the invasion and recapture the Moon. There are three different weapons to choose, and you'll need to use them effectively to defeat an armada of UFOs and other strange enemies before they blast you to pieces!

		<name>Switchball HD</name>
		<desc>Switchball is a 3D strategy game where the player controls a marble through hazardous courses with different kinds of puzzles, with gameplay similar to Marble Madness or the more contemporary Ballance and Marble Blast. There are 5 worlds; Sky, Ice, Cave, Lava and Cloud, unlocked gradually and with different levels. Each narrow, winding course is played in mid-air and to complete a level the player has to guide the marble to the end where it boards a gyrocopter that transports it to the next course. To solve the puzzles, the marble often needs to be rolled into Morphs that can switch the shape to four different balls: Marble, Metal, Air and Power, each with different abilities and characteristics. For instance, the Powerball can be charged in a generator, providing the ability to jump, dash, or magnetism. The Airball can be inflated with helium to reach higher areas. Supporting the AGEIA PhysX engine both through software and hardware, blocks can be pushed or topple down, cloth tears when the ball is too heavy and all kinds of items can be moved around.</desc>

		<name>Worms Crazy Golf</name>
		<desc>Worms Crazy Golf is a golf game built around classic elements of the Worms series. The game is played against a 2D scenery with the goal to put the ball with as few swings as possible. If a course is completed in the par score or under, the next one is unlocked. The environment has many platforms and objects that can obstruct the ball or help it to travel farther. Aiming is done with a classic control system to determine the direction. The shot power is determined by charging it through a meter. The most powerful shots require precise timing as there is a red zone in the meter that causes a mistake and a penalty. Optionally the ball can be hit through a large image of a golf ball in the bottom right corner. Next to the main objective a hole can be completed 100% by collecting all coins, reaching the tricky crate and beating the skill points score.</desc>

		<name>PopCap Bejeweled Twist</name>
		<desc>Bejeweled Twist is a puzzle game of the Bejeweled series created and published PopCap Games, released on October 17, 2008. Instead of switching the positions of two gems vertically or horizontally, the cursor in Bejeweled Twist is a circular lens that rotates four gems clockwise on the gameboard. Not every move has to form a line of three, but each time a line is formed during a move, a multiplier chain will increase which will multiply points earned during the game. The multiplier chain will be broken if a move is made which does not line up three or more gems. There are several different modes of gameplay available.</desc>

		<desc>Bonnie's Bookstore is a word-forming puzzle video game developed by New Crayon Games and published by PopCap Games. On each level, tiles containing one (or in some cases, two) letters are arranged in a specific structure. As in the similar title Bookworm, players use adjacent letters to form valid words, with points being awarded based on the length of the word. In most cases, once a letter is used, it is removed from the board, with existing letters moving downwards and new letters filling in from the top.</desc>

Players need to match animals to clear them from the board. In most included game modes, this needs to be done before the upcoming water reaches the ark shown on the left side of the screen. This acts as the time limit and players are given points based on the remaining distance. When the water hits the ark, the game is over. The game can be played on different difficulty levels, based on the speed of the water and the diversity of the animals that need to be matched. There are three main game modes.</desc>

		<name>PopCap Peggle World of Warcraft Edition</name>
		<desc>Peggle: World of Warcraft Edition was a free stand-alone version of the game Peggle Nights. It was a promotional game for both the Peggle franchise and the MMORPG World of Warcraft. Along with this promotion, two addons for World of Warcraft were released to play Bejeweled and Peggle in-game.[2]Even though the basic gameplay is completely identical to Peggle Nights, controlling a cannon near the top of the screen to shoot balls in order to hit specific pegs, including the fever mode at the end of the game, the art is specifically themed after the World of Warcraft assets with characters from the game and various references, such as fitting introductions to the different stages. The game includes an Adventure mode with two stages of five levels each, Quick Play to play any of the unlocked levels, Duel for a two-player mode against a friend or the computer, and ten new tasks in the Challenge mode. There are also two characters to choose from and no further limitations to the gameplay.The game is no longer officially available, as PopCap was purchased by Electronic Arts, a competitor to Activision Blizzard, in 2011.</desc>

		<name>PopCap Peggle Deluxe</name>
		<desc>Peggle is a casual puzzle video game developed by Sukhbir Sidhu and Brian Rothstein of PopCap Games. Initially released for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X systems in 2007, it has since had versions released for Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, the Nintendo DS (with the help of Q Entertainment), Windows Mobile, the iPod, the iPhone OS, Zeebo and Android; the game has also been ported as a Java application, and an extended minigame incorporated into the massively multiplayer online game World of Warcraft. A sequel was released in September 2008, titled Peggle Nights. Inspired by pachinko, each level of Peggle challenges the player to shoot a limited supply of balls at a field of colored pegs to clear out specifically marked pegs while attempting to achieve a high score through skilled shot planning. Special powers associated with a number of cartoon "Peggle Masters" can be activated to aid the player in this task. Peggle initially sold slowly but was boosted by the inclusion of a specially designed demonstration in Valve's The Orange Box, and has since enjoyed over 50 million downloads from the Internet. Both its release on Xbox Live Arcade and the iPhone OS have enjoyed similar success.</desc>

		<desc>Cosmo Bugs is the precursor to the game Water Bugs. An updated outer space version of the likes of Qix and JezzBall, the object of the game is to divide and clear a certain amount of the playing field. The playing field is filled with enemies who must be evaded and destroyed via being captured within a division. There are also enemies along the border of the playing field who must be treated in the same fashion but unlike their counterparts may fire on you when you are setting off a dividing line. Most enemies walk in random patterns and behave in an unintelligent manner but there are some enemies who will follow your cursor in order to block a division. There are also power-ups to get from destroyed enemies such as missiles, bombs and line enhancers. Look out however for power-downs that will make your job a little harder.</desc>

		<name>PopCap Escape Rosecliff Island</name>
		<desc>Escape Rosecliff Island is a hidden object game where the player takes the role of a castaway stranded on a mysterious and remote island. The main objective is to find and click on all the items from a list at the bottom of the screen, on locations around the island filled with assorted objects, within a time limit. Some of the list items have riddles instead of the object name, like "collects nuts" for a squirrel, "cuts paper" for a pair of scissors, and so on. The hint button highlights the position of one of the required objects, but takes 7,500 points from the score and about a minute to recharge after use. A relaxed mode, without the time constraints, can be selected at the start of the game. Besides the list items, each location has two hidden locks. A new mode called "Unlimited Seek &amp; Find" is available at the main menu after completing the game and finding all the fifty locks, where the goal is to find every single item from each location as fast as possible. The mini-games that appear between the stages are versions of classic casual games. There are implementations of concentration, jigsaw puzzles, circle puzzles, word search and tile-matching titles. In the circle puzzle, a scrambled picture is divided in circular segments, and the objective is to rotate each ring until it is in the correct position. In the tile-matching mini-game, the player has to swap two adjacent tiles in a grid and connect three or more matching figures to make them disappear, breaking the background layer to complete the level.</desc>

		<desc>In Feeding Frenzy, players control a hungry marine predator intent on munching as many other fish as possible. During the course of the game's 40 levels, they switch off between 5 marine animals. The last level is where they attempt to dethrone a large shark, the "Shark King", using Orville the Orca. The player takes on the role of different aquatic species each trying to move up the food chain. As smaller fish are eaten, the player's own fish grows in size and becomes capable of eating somewhat larger fish.[3] By the end of each level, the fish is sufficiently large enough that it can eat almost anything on-screen. Players must be vigilant for hazards which include depth charges, larger predators, naval mines, irradiated fish, and jellyfish.If the player eats a sufficiently large number of fish in a short period of time, a score-enhancing Feeding Frenzy is initiated. If the player continues to rapidly consume other fish, a further Double Frenzy can be achieved. These both end when a short period of time without further rapid consumption elapses.The full game includes both a normal mode and a "time attack" mode.</desc>

		<desc>The objective of the game is to smash the gnomes coming from the holes in the game area. The player controls a hammer with the mouse, and clicking on the gnomes reduces their hearts, displayed on the bottom of the gnome, depending on the power of the hammer. The default hammer takes away one heart, but more powerful hammers can be bought at the shop. There are various gnomes in the game, with different health and characteristics. Care must be taken to avoid clicking on traps, such as bombs. The player starts with five hearts, which is reduced when a click misses, a gnome escapes, or a trap is activated. They can be recovered by clicking on the hearts dropped by gnomes, or purchasing them from the shop. The maximum amount of hearts can be raised by making a purchase at the shop as well. If all of the hearts run out, the game is over. Starting on level five (six in the Deluxe version), the shop begins popping up from holes. If clicked, the player is taken to a new screen where they can buy several things, such as hammers, hearts, and other powerups. Coins are used to purchase items from the shop. There are various way to obtain coins, such as picking them up when left behind by gnomes, completing a bonus round, or defeating certain gnomes and/or in a certain manner.</desc>

Players must slide tiles across the grid and land them in specific locations to form an image. Areas where tiles must be placed are often not immediately accessible. For this reason, tiles must often be used to block other tiles, then removed and placed in other locations. During gameplay, players may choose to reset the puzzle, go back one move, and receive a hint. On completing a puzzle, players can receive gold, silver, or bronze medals based on how few moves they used.</desc>

		<name>PopCap Pizza Frenzy</name>
		<desc>For many years, the Italian Stromboli family made the best pizza in Europe, but now their business is threatened by assembly line products. The player need to help rebuild the family's empire by delivering pizzas as fast as possible. The game contains three game modes based on the same principle. Shown from a top-down view, the player visits different cities where a certain number of pizzas need to be delivered. Before starting a game, the player can select the main topping to offer in that city. Each game, there are two or more pizza houses, one for each type of topping. At irregular intervals, icons with customers appear, requesting a pizza with a specific topping. The player needs to click them and take them back to the delivery house. For each delivered pizza, a tip can be picked up and after a perfect game a zeppelin dropping money appears. By progressing through the game, new toppings can be unlocked and upgraded in four steps. For upgraded toppings, more of them can be collected at once before returning to a delivery house. The gameplay is spiced up through specific characters such as the celebrity that gives big tips when served in time, the clown that mixes up the order, a banker who collects the tips for the player, bums who can't make up their mind, a gossip lady who can change the orders of the other customers, and many more. There are also bad characters such as a thief or a prankster that need to be taken to the police station first. After a number of games, there is a bonus round where players need to recreate the different toppings on a pizza. There are three main game modes to play. Speed mode is reflex-based and is played in real-time. Players need to pick up the orders and the tips as fast as possible. The second mode is Memory where the toppings for each customer need to be remembered as they are blanked out before the player can deliver them. The third mode is Simon Says, similar to the Memory mode, but also requiring a specific order of delivery. Players can also design their own pizzas based on the unlocked toppings and there are twelve different cities to play.</desc>

		<name>PopCap Rocket Mania Deluxe</name>
		<desc>In Rocket Mania, players earn points for launching fireworks with speed and skill. This is done by rotating the fuse segments on a grid to form a path between the flame sources on the left and fire rockets on the right. While the two are connected, the rockets are launched, gaining points. Bonus points can be won by launching multiple rockets at once, which is possible since the fuse segments usually contain 3-way or 4-way joints, effectively dividing the flame path. After a rocket launch, all segments of fuses that were touched by the flames are removed and replaced with new random fuse segments (with existing parts falling down to fill any space). The connections are conveniently color coded to easily identify segments of fuses that are connected to a fire source or one or more rockets. Players often find it useful to work backwards (from the rockets), allowing the installation of a multiple rocket launch before making connection with fuse segments already connected to the flames.</desc>

		<name>PopCap Zuma Deluxe</name>
		<desc>Zuma Deluxe is an Aztec-themed action puzzler. The goal: eliminate all the balls before they reach the skull. Balls roll down a track towards this skull and the player-controlled frog-shaped idol must shoot balls toward them to stop them, earning points. Using the mouse to rotate the frog and clicking to fire, the player needs to create rows of three or more of the same color balls to eliminate them. The catch is that each track is shaped differently. Part of the track may block others so that if the track is filled with balls, the ones behind some may be unreachable. Fortunately, the player has up to four lives, a rarity in many puzzle games. The game offers two different play modes: Adventure Mode The player must battle through multiple temples to find the secrets of the Zuma. In this "campaign mode", temples that have been defeated may be skipped by the player when the player continues the game via save game. Gauntlet Mode The player must work the player's level up from Rabbit to Sun God. Levels used in this mode must first be unlocked from the Adventure Mode. Gauntlet Mode also offers 4 (four) additional play modes: Random, Spesific, Practice, and Survival.</desc>

		<desc>Cosmo Bugs is the precursor to the game Water Bugs. An updated outer space version of the likes of Qix and JezzBall, the object of the game is to divide and clear a certain amount of the playing field. The playing field is filled with enemies who must be evaded and destroyed via being captured within a division. There are also enemies along the border of the playing field who must be treated in the same fashion but unlike their counterparts may fire on you when you are setting off a dividing line. Most enemies walk in random patterns and behave in an unintelligent manner but there are some enemies who will follow your cursor in order to block a division. There are also power-ups to get from destroyed enemies such as missiles, bombs and line enhancers. Look out however for power-downs that will make your job a little harder.</desc>

		<name>PopCap Escape Rosecliff Island</name>
		<desc>Escape Rosecliff Island is a hidden object game where the player takes the role of a castaway stranded on a mysterious and remote island. The main objective is to find and click on all the items from a list at the bottom of the screen, on locations around the island filled with assorted objects, within a time limit. Some of the list items have riddles instead of the object name, like "collects nuts" for a squirrel, "cuts paper" for a pair of scissors, and so on. The hint button highlights the position of one of the required objects, but takes 7,500 points from the score and about a minute to recharge after use. A relaxed mode, without the time constraints, can be selected at the start of the game. Besides the list items, each location has two hidden locks. A new mode called "Unlimited Seek &amp; Find" is available at the main menu after completing the game and finding all the fifty locks, where the goal is to find every single item from each location as fast as possible. The mini-games that appear between the stages are versions of classic casual games. There are implementations of concentration, jigsaw puzzles, circle puzzles, word search and tile-matching titles. In the circle puzzle, a scrambled picture is divided in circular segments, and the objective is to rotate each ring until it is in the correct position. In the tile-matching mini-game, the player has to swap two adjacent tiles in a grid and connect three or more matching figures to make them disappear, breaking the background layer to complete the level.</desc>

		<desc>In Feeding Frenzy, players control a hungry marine predator intent on munching as many other fish as possible. During the course of the game's 40 levels, they switch off between 5 marine animals. The last level is where they attempt to dethrone a large shark, the "Shark King", using Orville the Orca. The player takes on the role of different aquatic species each trying to move up the food chain. As smaller fish are eaten, the player's own fish grows in size and becomes capable of eating somewhat larger fish.[3] By the end of each level, the fish is sufficiently large enough that it can eat almost anything on-screen. Players must be vigilant for hazards which include depth charges, larger predators, naval mines, irradiated fish, and jellyfish.If the player eats a sufficiently large number of fish in a short period of time, a score-enhancing Feeding Frenzy is initiated. If the player continues to rapidly consume other fish, a further Double Frenzy can be achieved. These both end when a short period of time without further rapid consumption elapses.The full game includes both a normal mode and a "time attack" mode.</desc>

		<desc>For many years, the Italian Stromboli family made the best pizza in Europe, but now their business is threatened by assembly line products. The player need to help rebuild the family's empire by delivering pizzas as fast as possible. The game contains three game modes based on the same principle. Shown from a top-down view, the player visits different cities where a certain number of pizzas need to be delivered. Before starting a game, the player can select the main topping to offer in that city. Each game, there are two or more pizza houses, one for each type of topping. At irregular intervals, icons with customers appear, requesting a pizza with a specific topping. The player needs to click them and take them back to the delivery house. For each delivered pizza, a tip can be picked up and after a perfect game a zeppelin dropping money appears. By progressing through the game, new toppings can be unlocked and upgraded in four steps. For upgraded toppings, more of them can be collected at once before returning to a delivery house. The gameplay is spiced up through specific characters such as the celebrity that gives big tips when served in time, the clown that mixes up the order, a banker who collects the tips for the player, bums who can't make up their mind, a gossip lady who can change the orders of the other customers, and many more. There are also bad characters such as a thief or a prankster that need to be taken to the police station first. After a number of games, there is a bonus round where players need to recreate the different toppings on a pizza. There are three main game modes to play. Speed mode is reflex-based and is played in real-time. Players need to pick up the orders and the tips as fast as possible. The second mode is Memory where the toppings for each customer need to be remembered as they are blanked out before the player can deliver them. The third mode is Simon Says, similar to the Memory mode, but also requiring a specific order of delivery. Players can also design their own pizzas based on the unlocked toppings and there are twelve different cities to play.</desc>

		<name>PopCap Rocket Mania Deluxe</name>
		<desc>In Rocket Mania, players earn points for launching fireworks with speed and skill. This is done by rotating the fuse segments on a grid to form a path between the flame sources on the left and fire rockets on the right. While the two are connected, the rockets are launched, gaining points. Bonus points can be won by launching multiple rockets at once, which is possible since the fuse segments usually contain 3-way or 4-way joints, effectively dividing the flame path. After a rocket launch, all segments of fuses that were touched by the flames are removed and replaced with new random fuse segments (with existing parts falling down to fill any space). The connections are conveniently color coded to easily identify segments of fuses that are connected to a fire source or one or more rockets. Players often find it useful to work backwards (from the rockets), allowing the installation of a multiple rocket launch before making connection with fuse segments already connected to the flames.</desc>

The game is divided in chapters, each based on a poem or fairy tale story with a final boss character. After defeating the boss, Lex receives one of the treasures. These artifacts give special powers to fight the battles, increasing the attack power and helping in other ways. Lex can carry up to three treasures at the same time, and they can be selected along with a companion on a separate screen between chapters. These companions are mythic characters that take up one of the treasure slots and join Lex during the battle, giving potions, attacking the enemy and increasing positive statistics.</desc>

The IBM PC version also features the ability to upload portraits of one's face, and placed in a three-dimensional animated body. This brought the whole experience closer, and it is often considered to be a good feature of the game.The PC version would later be released in the United Kingdom in 2001 under the show's UK name Family Fortunes.

Inspired by pachinko, each level of Peggle challenges the player to shoot a limited supply of balls at a field of colored pegs to clear out specifically marked pegs while attempting to achieve a high score through skilled shot planning. Special powers associated with a number of cartoon "Peggle Masters" can be activated to aid the player in this task. Peggle initially sold slowly but was boosted by the inclusion of a specially designed demonstration in Valve's The Orange Box, and has since enjoyed over 50 million downloads from the Internet. Both its release on Xbox Live Arcade and the iPhone OS have enjoyed similar success.</desc>

There are also coins scattered around the "frame" that also awards cash.After each successful set of frames, the player has the option to buy items, including 20 bowling balls each with special powers, such as rockets that allow the bowler to immediately blast the ball in a different direction.As the game progresses, each frame becomes more and more like specialized miniature golf holes, with alternate routes, obstacles, and so forth.</desc>

Typer Shark also contains a typing tutor mode to increase typing abilities, along with a statistics page so that the user can track their performance and see how they improve over time. The main adventure game mode has branching paths that allow players to choose various challenges, from toxic sharks with mutating letters, to stealth hammerhead sharks where the word remains invisible for a period of time. Over time, the player's "Shark Zapper" builds up and can be used to instantly destroy an entire wave of enemies. Every few levels a boss battle occurs, in which the player must type the words on the projectiles to send them flying back at the enemy. Abyss mode is an endless mode in which the player continuously dives deeper and the waves of sharks become more challenging. Every few hundred feet a boss battle occurs.</desc>

The frog always points in the direction of the mouse. When three or more balls of the same color are matched together, they are cleared from the playfield. Gaps can be formed through which the player can shoot more balls or collect fruit. Gaps are automatically closed if the balls at both ends of the gaps are (or become) the same color, potentially leading to chain reactions.</desc>

"Island" features fast sports cars which can turn sharply on mostly wide roads while "Bay" has bouncy cars with less traction, making accidental over steering more likely. "Coast" features slower cars with little traction and small roads where cars are able to drift through corners.

		<desc>This 20th Anniversary Edition is a remake of Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers. It features new HD graphics, new puzzles, new voice acting, a remastered soundtrack by the original composer, and even some new locations. The game stays true to the original in terms of the story, and while it is still a 3rd-person point-and-click adventure game, it uses 3D graphics and character models instead of 2D graphics with sprites. Unlike the original, the game includes a hint book which lets you gradually (tip by tip until the actual solution) view tips on how to solve puzzles. There is a certain waiting time between checking the next available hint. Also, the hint book is integrated as Gabriel's diary where he keeps track of the story and his ideas which may provide clues to solving some puzzles or figuring what to do next. And finally, the book also contains extras which are tied to your current location.</desc>

		<desc>Return to Monkey Island is an unexpected, thrilling return of series creator Ron Gilbert that continues the story of the legendary adventure games The Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge developed in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games. It’s been many years since Guybrush Threepwood was last locked in a battle of wits with his nemesis, the zombie pirate LeChuck. His true love, Elaine Marley, has turned her focus away from governing and Guybrush himself is adrift and unfulfilled, having never found the Secret of Monkey Island. Hip, young pirate leaders led by Captain Madison have shuffled the old guard from power, Melee Island has taken a turn for the worse, and famed businessman Stan has been imprisoned for ‘marketing-related crimes’. Banter with old friends and new faces on familiar islands now under dangerous new leadership. Then, take to the high seas and explore the new and unknown as you work your way out of tough predicaments. Clever puzzles, bizarre situations, and devastating ripostes are all that stand between Guybrush and glory.</desc>

		<desc>Jill is a young baker who acquired her passion for baking from her grandparents in their bakery, Evans Bakery. When she returned from culinary school, she discovered Evans Bakery closed down because a "Mega-Mart" moved in. Jill decides to show the mega corporation what her family's baking is all about and opened her own bakery in order to earn enough money to buy back Evans Bakery. Can Jill handle the pressure of running her own business and beat Mega-Mart? In Cake Mania, your job is to help Jill meet the monthly quota through 48 progressively difficult levels. This is no simple task because you will have to bake quickly as well as serve the customers quickly. There are a variety of different customers to serve. From nice old ladies to impatient holiday icons like Cupid! Each kind of customer have a different patience-level (indicated by the number of hearts). The longer they wait, the lower their patience. If they get too low, they will storm off and cost you money! When a customer first enters your bakery, hand them a menu. Then they will give you their order (in the form of a thought bubble) and you will have to create that cake. If you create the wrong cake (wrong shape or wrong frosting, etc) then you will have to throw it away and start over (costing you more money). You start off with one oven and one frosting machine. Between levels you will have the opportunity to purchase upgrades or new items that will improve the bakery's. For example, you can purchase upgrade your oven to one that bakes faster or you can purchase a T.V. that will help improve customers' patience.</desc>

With it, the developers are bringing a boss rush game with tons of customization options to create unique character builds for any combat encounter. The game attempts to employ a Dark Souls aesthetic but truly ends up in a lane of its own. The world of Eldest Souls is populated with sparse amounts of characters that fill in the backstory. You are a lone warrior entering the citadel: A prison that was created to house the old gods, with your task being to defeat the last of them. There are notes from survivors about what went wrong in the citadel as well as mysterious items strewn about. These items, when given to the right character, will reward you with stat boosting items or further lore, though these interactions are minimal at best.</desc>

		<name>The King of Fighters XIII - Galaxy Edition</name>
		<desc>The King of Fighters XIII was released for PlayStation 3 late last year. Since then, SNK Playmore has collected, with much affection, suggestions and complaints from the fans about the game. From the PS3 release through April 2012, the company has been launching frequent updates based on their research to improve the game and make the title experience more accurate to the public's expectations. New characters have been added, the company has better balanced the game, removed some infinite combos that should not exist, among other improvements. Anyway, SNK Playmore, with a lot of sweat, had managed to finish the job, The King of Fighters XIII had stayed exactly as the gamers wanted. However, there was an issue that troubled the company. Originally the game was released for Arcade, and only after a time ported to the PS3. With the updates made, it was noted that the home version had gotten much better than the original version, making KOFXIII outdated in Arcade. Thinking about it, the company decided to do the reverse. If Arcade had given life to the game's home port, The King of Fighters XIII had to go back to Arcade and showcase all of its improvements, bringing back the glory of the franchise. With this premise is born The King of Fighters XIII Climax, made available a few days ago in Japan, bringing everything the version for PlayStation 3 has. Unfortunately, SNK distributor Atlus in the west has not revealed whether there are plans for the launch of KOFXIII Climax in the Arcades here.</desc>

		<name>Bloody Paws Unleashed</name>
		<desc>Bloody Paws Unleashed is a remake and expansion of the 1990 game Bloody Paws, which was developed in Spain by Mar Entertainment and released for the ZX Spectrum and MSX. In 2020, a completed version of Bloody Paws was released for the Amstrad CPC. The original 1990 Bloody Paws was a game full of personality: a side-scrolling beat ‘em up in which players control a melodramatic werewolf on a quest to find his missing wife and fight a horde of eccentric creatures such as invisible men, rope-jumping mummies, off-brand superheroes, and the Frankenstein monster. The game also had an unfortunate behind-the-scenes story: the publisher released the game before it was completed, without even informing (or paying!) the developers. Merso Entertainment counts with the blessing of the creator of the original Bloody Paws, Juan Carlos Sanchez, to bring this cool relic of the past to the PC and give it an overhaul. Free from the limitations of the 8-bit systems of the 80s, Bloody Paws Unleashed injects the original game with color, new levels, additional moves, and more! This remake also rescues elements that were not fully implemented in the original game due to memory limitations, like the witch. Thanks to the original sketches found by Juan Carlos, this enemy has been finally included in Bloody Paws, over 30 years later!</desc>

		<name>Mashed - Drive to Survive</name>
		<desc>Mashed is an action-packed top-down arcade-racer. On 13 tracks (which must be played free in single-player first) you need all your driving skills to survive and make it to the finish as the 1st with one of the four different cars available (from slow ones to really fast ones). 
 
The heart of the single-player mode (besides the quick battle against the AI) are the bronze, silver and gold challenges for every track you need to complete to play free the next track. Each challenge is one of the seven (eight in multiplayer) game modes available in Mashed. From normal race-events (just be the 1st) over battles where you need to kill all your enemies before they do to the ultimate survival mode where everyone doesn't really like you. 
 
To make things much easier there are nine different power-ups and weapons scattered on the tracks which you can pick up. From simple oil slicks over mines to deadly mortars there's everything you need to kick the enemy drivers out of the race. Of course they can also choose from the equipment. As you can only survive a few hits you need to make sure they can't use them on you. And to make it even worse there are many small passages (or the track is just one small passage...) with nothing on one or both sides of the track in which you or your enemy can fall very deep.</desc>

Developer QUByte Interactive took inspiration from all of the the unforgettable notes from that game style to proudly bring you "99Vidas". "99Vidas" is a brawler set in a contemporary world, but that pays tribute to both the classic and the new in the gaming industry. Brought to you in 16-bit pixelated glory, chock-full of references to not only gaming but also 80's and 90's pop culture. "99Vidas" takes full advantage modern era gameplay mechanics, making it the best of both worlds. 6 stages (with more to come) will take you on a journey to different parts of the world to face hordes of fierce enemies and relentless bosses, but you don’t have to do it alone: you can face this challenge with up to 3 other players in co-op play, both local and online.</desc>

		<desc>The objective of the game is to smash the gnomes coming from the holes in the game area. The player controls a hammer with the mouse, and clicking on the gnomes reduces their hearts, displayed on the bottom of the gnome, depending on the power of the hammer. The default hammer takes away one heart, but more powerful hammers can be bought at the shop. There are various gnomes in the game, with different health and characteristics. Care must be taken to avoid clicking on traps, such as bombs. The player starts with five hearts, which is reduced when a click misses, a gnome escapes, or a trap is activated. They can be recovered by clicking on the hearts dropped by gnomes, or purchasing them from the shop. The maximum amount of hearts can be raised by making a purchase at the shop as well. If all of the hearts run out, the game is over. Starting on level five (six in the Deluxe version), the shop begins popping up from holes. If clicked, the player is taken to a new screen where they can buy several things, such as hammers, hearts, and other powerups. Coins are used to purchase items from the shop. There are various way to obtain coins, such as picking them up when left behind by gnomes, completing a bonus round, or defeating certain gnomes and/or in a certain manner.</desc>

		<desc>Bejeweled Twist is a puzzle game of the Bejeweled series created and published PopCap Games, released on October 17, 2008. Instead of switching the positions of two gems vertically or horizontally, the cursor in Bejeweled Twist is a circular lens that rotates four gems clockwise on the gameboard. Not every move has to form a line of three, but each time a line is formed during a move, a multiplier chain will increase which will multiply points earned during the game. The multiplier chain will be broken if a move is made which does not line up three or more gems. There are several different modes of gameplay available.</desc>

		<desc>A lone pilot, far from home, must navigate an abstract universe of uncharted planets and space stations guarded by mysterious, hostile aliens in Gravitar: Recharged. You must complete missions in each solar system, navigating a variety of challenging environments, each with varying levels of gravity that will test your skills as a pilot. Complete each mission within a solar system and you will be transported to the next through a massive black hole. Will you ever make it home? The visual aesthetic of Gravitar: Recharged takes the Recharged series in a new direction, with expansive environments rendered in painterly style and pastel tones. In the capable hands of industry-veteran composer Megan McDuffee, the original soundtrack complements the art style with soothing, atmospheric tracks that evoke a sense of wonder. Key Features: Arcade mode: fly from planet to planet and progress through ever-more-challenging solar systems in a quest to get home. Missions: 24 taxing challenges with global leaderboards. Power-Ups: Pick-up power-ups with your tractor beam, including homing missiles and EMP disruptors Co-op: Play with a partner in each game mode, which connects two players on a tether, requiring a significant level of coordination. Get in the Groove: Megan McDuffee continues to deliver with an ambient score that transports you into the depths of the unknown.</desc>

		<name>Slice Dice and Rice</name>
		<desc>Slice Dice and Rice is an indie fighting game with no health bars. Inspired by Bushido Blade, it revolves around the idea of finding an opening in opponents defense and ending the round with a single, clean hit. Gone are the tedious hit points – each scratch impairs your movement, every wound might be your last. Gameplay Our goal was to make fighting games accessible to anyone. An intuitive set of basic abilities allowed us to remove the need for memorizing inputs and move-lists, while retaining the complexity. Moves can be canceled to feint an attack, hits can be parried or dodged, and they can clash with one another. This creates a mind-game heavy gameplay, one that mimics real samurai showdowns Characters and Stages You can play as one of 8 characters, all with their own stories and unique fighting styles. Game’s cast offers many variations of gameplay, from a swift monk using only his fists in battle, to a muscular lady with a giant sword that compensates speed and mobility with endurance during her attacks. Fights take place in alternative version of Japanese underworld and features 6 unique stages with hand-drawn textures.</desc>

The game’s art direction reflects this, but Sonic 2 HD has also given equal attention to unseen essential elements in the physics and audio. The result of this is an unprecedented re-interpretation in high definition graphics, music and gameplay of Sonic 2, which continues to set quality standards to this day.</desc>

Unlike most of the other Castlevania games, Simon's Quest does not feature the traditional stages but allows you to freely roam the land of Transylvania in the style of Nintendo's Metroid. In several towns Simon can talk with NPC's and buy items in shops, adding a touch of role-playing.</desc>

		<name>PopCap Zuma Deluxe</name>
		<desc>Zuma Deluxe is an Aztec-themed action puzzler. The goal: eliminate all the balls before they reach the skull. Balls roll down a track towards this skull and the player-controlled frog-shaped idol must shoot balls toward them to stop them, earning points. Using the mouse to rotate the frog and clicking to fire, the player needs to create rows of three or more of the same color balls to eliminate them. The catch is that each track is shaped differently. Part of the track may block others so that if the track is filled with balls, the ones behind some may be unreachable. Fortunately, the player has up to four lives, a rarity in many puzzle games. The game offers two different play modes: Adventure Mode The player must battle through multiple temples to find the secrets of the Zuma. In this "campaign mode", temples that have been defeated may be skipped by the player when the player continues the game via save game. Gauntlet Mode The player must work the player's level up from Rabbit to Sun God. Levels used in this mode must first be unlocked from the Adventure Mode. Gauntlet Mode also offers 4 (four) additional play modes: Random, Spesific, Practice, and Survival.</desc>

		<name>TFE: Star Wars - Dark Forces</name>
		<desc>Special Mod that let's you upscale graphics and control schema to modern era. Kyle Katarn is a former Imperial officer turned mercenary, now hired by the Rebel Alliance.  After having stolen the Death Star plans from a remote facility, he is tasked with investigating the sudden destruction of a hidden Rebel base. This leads him to face off against Imperial General Rom Mohc and the various iterations of his ''Dark Troopers'' - cybernetic soldiers with the armor and firepower to turn the tide of the war.Dark Forces is a close prequel to the original Star Wars movie trilogy. The game marks LucasArts' first attempt to enter the first-person shooter market. Instead of licensing the Doom engine, like many competitors, LucasArts created its own internal ''Jedi'' engine. The Jedi engine contains advanced features over similar tech, including the ability to look up and down, jump, crouch, and limited support (in the build used for Dark Forces) for rooms (sectors) over rooms. 3D models also make occasional appearances inside the game, as turrets or Kyle's ship dropping him off or picking him up from each mission. Most levels have a fairly complex, often maze-like structure, and include various switches that need to be activated to change the layout of the level. Jumping is integrated into the gameplay, as certain areas can only be accessed in that way. In addition to weapons, Kyle can use shields to protect himself from damage, a head lamp to illuminate dark areas, as well as specific items used to counter environmental hazards. The player character is given a certain amount of ''lives'' per level; he dies permanently once he runs out of all of them. Game progress can be saved only between missions.The game features fourteen substantial levels as Kyle works to disarm the Dark Trooper project. Many levels reference characters or areas from the Star Wars movie trilogy, such as a visit with Jabba the Hutt, a trip to Coruscant, and a battle through the interior of a Star Destroyer.  As opposed to most first-person shooters of the time period, every level has objectives for Kyle to complete, ranging from grabbing a clue and getting out alive, to planting charges around a facility to demolish it.  Cutscenes appear between key missions to update the plot.The Star Wars license gets plenty of use, and the game features Imperial officers, stormtroopers, and a collection of aliens seen in the films as enemies. Blaster rifles and thermal detonators are used as weapons, along with other firearms inspired by the tech of the films. Dark Forces also uses the iMuse engine to dynamically change the music during action scenes, with much of the music based off, or directly replicating, John Williams' original film score. The game is entirely a single-player campaign, and no multiplayer is included or supported.</desc>

Shaolin vs Wutang 2 is a 1 on 1 INDIE CASUAL combat game featuring hand to hand and weapon combat, great music and inspired graphics. No flashy over the top effects, just combat influenced by classic Kung Fu films. The game features authentic fighting sounds from films and a all new licensed soundtrack with great music. Shaolin vs Wutang is a real love letter to classic 70's and 80's Kung Fu cinema. This is a indie passion project that was made by one person who has tremendous passion for, and knowledge of Kung Fu films. It is not my intention to provide the same experience as big budget fighting games. But rather I hope to provide players with a satisfying gaming experience blended with nostalgia and reminiscence of the great Kung Fu films.</desc>

		<desc>Peggle: World of Warcraft Edition was a free stand-alone version of the game Peggle Nights. It was a promotional game for both the Peggle franchise and the MMORPG World of Warcraft. Along with this promotion, two addons for World of Warcraft were released to play Bejeweled and Peggle in-game.[2]Even though the basic gameplay is completely identical to Peggle Nights, controlling a cannon near the top of the screen to shoot balls in order to hit specific pegs, including the fever mode at the end of the game, the art is specifically themed after the World of Warcraft assets with characters from the game and various references, such as fitting introductions to the different stages. The game includes an Adventure mode with two stages of five levels each, Quick Play to play any of the unlocked levels, Duel for a two-player mode against a friend or the computer, and ten new tasks in the Challenge mode. There are also two characters to choose from and no further limitations to the gameplay.The game is no longer officially available, as PopCap was purchased by Electronic Arts, a competitor to Activision Blizzard, in 2011.</desc>

		<path>./House of the Dead-Scarlet Dawn.lnk</path>
		<name>House of the Dead: Scarlet Dawn</name>
		<desc>House of the Dead: Scarlet Dawn is the fifth arcade game in the House of the Dead series. It takes place in 2006, between the events of The House of the Dead 4 and The House of the Dead III. The game's story follows AMS agents Kate Green and Ryan Taylor who infiltrate Scarecrow Manor just as a horde of bioengineered creatures attack. From then on they have to fight their way to safety while exploring the mansion and uncovering who is behind the outbreak. Like in previous games in the series, the player uses a gun controller to shoot enemies as they appear on the screen. Each creature has a weak spot that deals extra damage when hit. In addition to the monsters, there are also civilians that have to be avoided. The player also has to keep track of the partner who at any time might need to be rescued. Failure to do so before time runs out leads to a life penalty. A new feature to the series is the introduction of quick-time events in which the player needs to quickly shoot a specific target. Reloading is automatic but can also be done manually by pointing outside the screen. In addition to the main machine gun, the player can choose two more items (shotgun, grenade, rocket launcher, etc.) ahead of each level. In the Japanese version, items are bought with coins which are awarded for successful actions such as critical shots, collectibles obtained and saved civilians while in the international versions items can be chosen freely. Another Japan-exclusive feature is the use of Aime cards. They are used for storing progress, keeping collected coins, completing achievements, checking high scores and taking part in national leaderboards. Part of the Aime functionality is also a level system where players earn experience for each stage completed and are rewarded with coins for every level up. The game has two game modes: normal mode and master mode. The normal mode is for first time players and includes assistance events. The master mode is for advanced players and has stronger and faster enemies.</desc>
