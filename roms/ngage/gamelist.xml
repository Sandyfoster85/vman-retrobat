The three friends must now travel to a place called "Wishing Engine", and be granted a wish to revert the world back to normal. 
 
The characters each have a special movement to kill enemies with. The game uses floating camera angles through a vast Prince of Persia-style world. The goal of the game is to clear the various levels, avoiding spikes and enemies and collecting coins for extra lives. 
 
Unlike most 3D platformers, Pandemonium offers only two-dimensional movement, rather than complete freedom of movement. The characters move along a curving 2D course within a 3D environment.</desc>

The basic idea is still the same: alone or with the help of your comrades shoot Nazis and complete objectives in a war-torn Europe during World War 2. As in the original campaign, here you can also partake in the action as U.S., British or a Russian soldiers during various missions. 
 
The game follows the basic concepts of a 3D Shooter, just as the "bigger" Call of Duty: players can run, look up and down, use ironsights, array of WW2 weaponry and help of their squadmates to an extent. Plus, in Call of Duty fashion you sometimes take up a role of a tank commander. There are eleven maps in total, plus some that are used in multiplayer games that could support up to four players via Bluetooth connection.</desc>

		<name>Tomb Raider: Starring Lara Croft</name>
		<desc>What more could you ask for than the delectable Lara Croft in the palm of your hand? Classic monster-shooting, exploration, and puzzle-solving action is on offer here, as Lara seeks the Scion, a relic from Atlantis. With 15 huge levels (set in South America, Greece, Egypt and Atlantis) and, even though it runs on a handheld device, full 3D graphics, this is, simply, the best portable version of Tomb Raider ever. Factor in a downloadable Assault Course which lets you compete against a ghost image of your friend's effort, and you have a winner.</desc>

		<name>Rayman 3</name>
		<desc>He may appear to have no body to connecting his limbs and head, but Rayman should not be underestimated. In this cartoon-style action-platform game, Rayman must extract the Dark Lum lord, who has been swallowed by his rather dumb friend Globox. 
With over 50 maps spread across eight universes, plus an N-Gage exclusive four-player Capture The Flag mode, Rayman 3 provides a feast of action-platform gameplay.</desc>
