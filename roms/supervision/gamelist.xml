		<name>Brain Power</name>
		<desc>Brain Power is a collection of four primarily logic-and-puzzle minigames:

Mine Detector, a clone of Minesweeper. The player is presented with a board filled with mines, and must find all of the open squares without clicking on any of the mines. Open squares contain a number, which indicates how many of the adjacent squares contains a mine. There are easy (55 mines), medium (66 mines), and hard (77 mines) modes.

Fortune Four, a version of the board game Qubic, also known as 3-D Tic-Tac-Toe. The player takes turn with the computer placing stones on a 4x4x4 grid, the goal being to create a chain of four stones in any direction.

Caterpillar, a clone of Snake. The player controls a snake that must avoid obstacles and eat food placed around the level. When the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer, but if it runs into an obstacle or its own body, it dies.

Hopper, a version of the board game Peg Solitaire. The player is given a grid with marbles arranged on it, and can remove marbles by "jumping" over them with an adjacent marble. The goal is to only have a single marble remaining. There are seven different layouts to choose from.</desc>

The player controls a tank which moves continually forward, and can freely move about the screen firing in any direction; the tank's cannon can be rotated independently of its movement. Enemy tanks appear from all sides, shooting at the player, and must be destroyed or avoided. At the end of each stage, a large boss appears that must be defeated to continue. Power-ups will occasionally appear that will allow the tank to fire in multiple directions simultaneously, but these are lost if the tank takes a hit.</desc>

		<desc>A strange alien spacecraft has been discovered orbiting the Earth, it its weaponry primed and ready to destroy the planet. Your mission: To infiltrate the craft, disable the weapons, initiate the self-destruct sequence, and escape with your life.

Chimera is an isometric adventure game set on an uninhabited space ship. The player must explore the ship, which is divided into a grid of rooms. There are various items scattered around the maze-like craft, which will be either a help or a hindrance. For example, food and water will keep the player alive, while radiators will quickly deplete water reserves while standing in the same room.

The only actions the player can perform are to move and to interact with objects. Many objects ? such as electric fences, or the aforementioned radiators ? are deadly to the touch unless the player has the correct item in their possession. The ultimate goal is to prime and activate the four-stage self destruct sequence in the correct order by using items found on the ship. A scrolling message indicator at the bottom of the screen provides useful status information.</desc>

The game can be played in either its 2-player or 3-player variant, but only a single human player can play in a given game; other slots are filled by computer-controlled opponents.

		<desc>Hash Blocks is a falling-blocks puzzle game similar to Columns. Blocks fall in sets of three from the top of the well, and can be cycled and rotated freely. If four blocks of the same type are lined up horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, they are cleared and removed from the playfield, causing any blocks above them to fall into the open space. If the blocks reach the top of the screen, the game is over.

The game includes two modes. Normal mode tasks the player with clearing a certain number of blocks before the playfield fills up. Flash mode requires the player to clear a specific, flashing block, which may be buried under multiple other blocks. Both modes offer three levels of difficulty, as well as multiple different block graphic sets to use.</desc>

There are a large variety of items that can be found within missions. Food will refill the player's life, grenades will grant an extra screen-clearing bomb, ammunition will let the player shoot faster, boots will increase walking speed, and the ever-useful SuperVision console will let the player access a map of the stage, which indicates which rooms still need bombs placed.

		<name>Recycle Design</name>
		<desc>Recycle Design is a clone of the popular puzzle game Pipe Dream. The player controls a plumber who must connect two ends of a pipe before the water within overflows. The player can place pipe tiles on the screen toward this end, though each piece of pipe costs money which must also be collected on each stage. There are several other differences from the game's inspiration: there are no cross pieces, the only penalty for replacing a piece is the cost of the pipe, two different pipe pieces are held at any time, and there are also rocks which can be pushed around that playfield that will block the path and destroy pipes.</desc>

		<name>Scaffolder</name>
		<desc>Scaffolder is a block puzzle game. Each puzzle consists of a set of blocks, which must be disassembled so that every block lies directly on the floor. The blocks are fragile, and if they fall more than one tile at a time, they will break and the puzzle will be failed. The player controls a man who can push and pull these blocks, as well as jump around the stage, who must also be careful not to let himself be crushed by the blocks. There are two different modes: beginner mode features relatively easy puzzles with no time limit, while skilled mode includes harder puzzles that must be completed within a time limit. Game progress is saved using passwords.</desc>

		<desc>Space Fighter is an action shooting game starring a team of three robot soldiers, who must defend their cities from an enemy robot army. Each stage consists of a small scrolling top-down map filled with enemy robots. The player must shoot and destroy a certain number of enemies on each stage in order to move on to the next.

There are three different robots to choose from, each with their own different abilities. HUNT is the quickest, but can only shoot straight forward; DALE is the slowest but has a powerful spread shot; and OWEN is average pm speed, but can fire in four directions simultaneously. On each stage, there is also a base that can be used to switch robots and refill their energy.</desc>

		<name>Sssnake</name>
		<desc>Sssnake is a basic Snake game. The player controls a snake in a small room filled with food and obstacles. The goal is to eat all the food while avoiding the obstacles, but whenever the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer, making it more difficult to maneuver. The snake moves forward at a constant speed and can be turned in the four cardinal directions. Holding a button will make the snake move faster, making it harder to control, but increasing the potential for a time bonus.

In this particular version, there are a number of apples on each stage. When an apple is eaten, it disappears, and an apple core appears elsewhere on the stage, and when the apple core is eaten, a deadly skull appears somewhere else. The player must eat all of the apples and apple cores in one run; they will all be reset if the snake touches an obstacle. The player will also earn bonus points if all the normal apples are eaten before any apple core is eaten.</desc>

Play Block is a clone of Flipull. The objective is to launch blocks at other blocks with matching patterns to clear them from the field. Clear enough blocks without running out of moves to move to the next stage.
Fill Block is a clone of Quarth. Groups of blocks fall from the top of the screen, and the objective is to shoot additional blocks at them to create rectangles, causing the blocks to clear. If a block passes the line at the bottom of the screen, the game is over.
Hit Block is a mixture of the two other games. Blocks of varying types fall from the top of the screen, and the player must launch a matching block at it to remove it from play. Launching the wrong type will add it to the stack. If a block passes the line at the bottom of the screen, the game is over.</desc>

There are several power-ups that will randomly appear to aid the player, including long-lasting shots, quick-fire shots, and scrolls that instantly reduce all balloons on the screen to the smallest size.
