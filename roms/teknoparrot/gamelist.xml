		<name>House of the Dead: Scarlet Dawn</name>
		<desc>**PATREON REQUIRED VIA TEKNOPARROT** PLAY FROM PC-GAMES FOR WINDOWS** House of the Dead: Scarlet Dawn is the fifth arcade game in the House of the Dead series. It takes place in 2006, between the events of The House of the Dead 4 and The House of the Dead III. The game's story follows AMS agents Kate Green and Ryan Taylor who infiltrate Scarecrow Manor just as a horde of bioengineered creatures attack. From then on they have to fight their way to safety while exploring the mansion and uncovering who is behind the outbreak. Like in previous games in the series, the player uses a gun controller to shoot enemies as they appear on the screen. Each creature has a weak spot that deals extra damage when hit. In addition to the monsters, there are also civilians that have to be avoided. The player also has to keep track of the partner who at any time might need to be rescued. Failure to do so before time runs out leads to a life penalty. A new feature to the series is the introduction of quick-time events in which the player needs to quickly shoot a specific target. Reloading is automatic but can also be done manually by pointing outside the screen. In addition to the main machine gun, the player can choose two more items (shotgun, grenade, rocket launcher, etc.) ahead of each level. In the Japanese version, items are bought with coins which are awarded for successful actions such as critical shots, collectibles obtained and saved civilians while in the international versions items can be chosen freely. Another Japan-exclusive feature is the use of Aime cards. They are used for storing progress, keeping collected coins, completing achievements, checking high scores and taking part in national leaderboards. Part of the Aime functionality is also a level system where players earn experience for each stage completed and are rewarded with coins for every level up. The game has two game modes: normal mode and master mode. The normal mode is for first time players and includes assistance events. The master mode is for advanced players and has stronger and faster enemies.</desc>

The player chooses one from three fighter jets (with different colors, speed and power), flies forward, shoot enemies, and avoids bullets. The player's ship's hitbox is very small, as in most bullet hell games.  The jet has main weapons and several other options to shoot. There is a 'lock' ability that introduces a slow mode and homing missiles and 'break' that launches a powerful energy wave and invincibility for a short time. The player must collect stars that will raise the Break Meter. The game has four modes: Boost, Original, Unlimited and Time Attack, and two difficulty settings: Arcade and Novice.</desc>

New characters Remy, Makoto, Q, and Twelve were also added, bringing the total number of playable fighters to twenty. Also re-introduced was the fan-favourite 'Destroy the Car' bonus stage. 

One of the new gameplay mechanics introduced in "3rd Strike" is the Guard Parry, also known as the 'Red Parry', which allows players to parry during guard stun, providing the timing is correct. Another new feature is after-match player evaluations in which the winner of a two-person match is graded in Offense, Defence, Tech and Extra. In single-player Arcade mode the player will always be evaluated, even in event of a loss. The grades range from E (lowest) to MSF, or Master Street Fighter (highest).</desc>

		<desc>BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger is a 2D fighting game with 12 characters, each with unique personalities, fighting styles and advantages. During the story mode every character has its own story which is told with dialogue between fights. During some of those dialogues the player has to choose between answers which influences the story's ending. Additionally there is a arcade mode (fighting against all characters in a row), score attack and a multiplayer mode.

The fighting system utilizes the usual fighting game options: there are weak, middle and strong attacks. Certain button combinations result in special, character specific attacks. If the player manages to hurt his opponent (or gets hit) a special energy bar fills up. If it is full he can unleash an especially powerful attack. There also is a stamina bar which decreases while blocking: when it is empty the character takes extra damage.</desc>

		<name>Chaos Code: New Sign of Catastrophe v1.03.00</name>
		<desc>The game uses a standard 8-way lever and four button (weak punch, weak kick, strong punch, strong kick) system. Characters can be customized prior to the fight, such as selecting two "edit special moves" from four possibilities to go along with the character's built-in attacks. Players can also select between "run" and "step" modes, placing the focus respectively on speed and technical play. The game makes use of a couple of systems that can quickly change the flow of battle:

Destruction Chaos: A high level super move that, if successfully connects, can eliminate half of the opponent's life gauge.

Exceed Chaos: Place the character into a special status which removes limitations on combos.</desc>

		<desc>Puzzle Bobble (known as Bust-A-Move outside of Japan) is a spin-off of the Bubble Bobble series, featuring themes from the original game (such as enemies trapped in bubbles by the cutesy dinosaur duo Bub and Bob that must be popped). Players attempt to clear a board of colored bubbles by firing other bubbles at an angle and matching multiple bubbles of the same color. Its characteristically cute Japanese animation and music, along with its play mechanics and level designs, made it successful as an arcade title and spawned several sequels and ports to home gaming systems.</desc>

		<desc>A game set in a Mediterranean environment in which, for the first time, players have the chance to show off their motor-cycle skills in a typically Italian urban setting. The game is a competition between two pizza delivery couriers in a race to see who can deliver their pizza first. The urban circuit allows interaction with all kinds of elements: cars, vans, windows, fences, people, etc. To help you complete your mission, you can collect icons giving you more speed, power or time. Hidden shortcuts help you gain valuable seconds.

You must choose from four pizza couriers each with his or her own particular abilities. There are three game levels: Margherita (easy), Capricciosa (medium) &amp; Diavolo (difficult). There are four different races at each level which allow you to show the other biker who has the most skill, daring and ability.</desc>

		<desc>After Burner Climax is a sequel to the long-running After Burner series. Just like the previous games players command an aircraft from a third-person view, engaging enemies, dodging enemy fire and rockets and navigating through canyons and narrow passages. Gameplay requires quick reflexes and is arcade-like in design. The iconic F-14 Super Tomcat of the previous games has been replaced by a F-14D Super Tomcat with the addition of two new aircraft, F/A-18E Super Hornet and F-15E Strike Eagle. In the standard EX arcade mode there is a branching mission path with various objectives. Sometimes enemies need to be engaged, while other times friendly fighters help along, stealth must be used, or a specific target needs to be pursued and taken out. There are two main weapons: regular cannon fire for close distances and rockets that can only be used when they are locked on. There is also a Climax gauge that can be activated when it is full.</desc>

The game consists of more than 48 missions covering four of Tokyo's districts: Ginza, Hibiya, Shinjuku and Shibuya. To gain promotion the player has to catch a number of criminals within a time limit. Not succeeding with this can instead lead to the player being demoted. To arrest a criminal the player has to move his car along side the criminal and hit it. Most of the time one hit is enough but for some of the tougher opponents multiple hits will be needed. There are in total nine cars to drive and each has their own characteristics that makes them more or less suitable for pursuing the various criminals.</desc>

		<name>The King of Fighters XIII Climax</name>
		<desc>The King of Fighters XIII was released for PlayStation 3 late last year. Since then, SNK Playmore has collected, with much affection, suggestions and complaints from the fans about the game. From the PS3 release through April 2012, the company has been launching frequent updates based on their research to improve the game and make the title experience more accurate to the public's expectations. New characters have been added, the company has better balanced the game, removed some infinite combos that should not exist, among other improvements. Anyway, SNK Playmore, with a lot of sweat, had managed to finish the job, The King of Fighters XIII had stayed exactly as the gamers wanted. However, there was an issue that troubled the company. Originally the game was released for Arcade, and only after a time ported to the PS3. With the updates made, it was noted that the home version had gotten much better than the original version, making KOFXIII outdated in Arcade. Thinking about it, the company decided to do the reverse. If Arcade had given life to the game's home port, The King of Fighters XIII had to go back to Arcade and showcase all of its improvements, bringing back the glory of the franchise. With this premise is born The King of Fighters XIII Climax, made available a few days ago in Japan, bringing everything the version for PlayStation 3 has. Unfortunately, SNK distributor Atlus in the west has not revealed whether there are plans for the launch of KOFXIII Climax in the Arcades here.</desc>

		<desc>1904 D.C. (Darius Calendar)— When a Belser virus rent the hyperspace network to tatters, every craft in the human space fleet with a network link was stripped of all communications capabilities. The ensuing chaos saw the entire fleet devastated in the blink of an eye. The Silver Hawk fighters were the only craft from Planet Darius to escape the massacre. Equipped with Burst technology, these two cutting-edge craft were entrusted to humanoid AI terminal Ti2 and test pilot Riga Pratica. Flying the Silver Hawk Burst fighters alone into enemy territory without network support, the two heroes braved overwhelming odds to secure victory and liberation for Darius. It is now 1910 D.C., and repairs on the hyperspace network have begun to reconnect the pockets of humanity scattered across the vast reaches of space. Combat data transmitted from Darius soon sees Burstequipped Silver Hawk fighters constructed in every inhabited galaxy. The stage is set for mankind’s grand counteroffensive. A team of heroes takes wing, flying into battle and the pages of history.</desc>

		<name>Too Spicy</name>
		<desc>2 Spicy is a cover based third person shooter made for arcades. The game is built around one-on-one fights between two players and is controlled with light guns and pedals. Pointing the gun at the screen allows the player to fire at the enemy while pointing away from the screen causes the player character to hide behind a cover such as an oil drum or a pillar. Moving between different covers is done by stepping on one of two pedals, causing the character to move either left or right. Stepping on a pedal twice allows the player to do jump shots when aiming at the screen and a dodge when aiming away. Aiming on the enemy for a certain amount of time causes the camera to zoom in and the player's attack power will be increased and it is possible to do a head shot for a large amount of damage.</desc>

		<name>Silent Hill: The Arcade</name>
		<desc>Silent Hill: The Arcade is an arcade game spin off of the survival horror video game series Silent Hill developed by Konami. The Arcade was first revealed at the 2007 Japan Arcade Operator's Union trade show by Konami. Being a rail shooter, Silent Hill: The Arcade is a large departure from the normal survival horror mechanics of the main series. The game deals with two characters, Eric and Tina, who have entered the town of Silent Hill and must battle monsters while uncovering the mystery behind Eric's nightmares about a girl and a steamship. The gameplay is similar to the House of the Dead series in which players use light guns to aim and shoot at enemies.Shooting away from the screen reloads the player's gun</desc>

		<name>The House of the Dead 4</name>
		<desc>The House of the Dead 4 is an arcade game that takes place shortly after The House of the Dead 4 for up to two players working cooperatively. Kate Green from the original game teams up with G to deal with another zombie infestation. This leads them to the Magician, a boss character from the first two games in the series. Next to the Magician, Justice is another boss character encountered in the game. Just like the original title the player holds an uzi gun to attack the zombies from a first-person perspective. There are two large screens, the seats can shake and air is blown when taking damage. As a rail shooter movement is done automatically, the player only aims and shoots. Some sections of the game are done on foot and others in a vehicle. There are also moments where a branching path can be chosen and there are various cut-scenes shown from a third-person perspective. Entirely new for the series is the addition for a green life bar near the bottom of the screen, allowing for multiple hits, taking damage, before the game is over.</desc>
