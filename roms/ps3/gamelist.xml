		<desc>Disgaea 3 is a sequel to Disgaea, a hardcore, turn-based, strategy RPG popular on the PlayStation2 and PlayStation Portable. In Disgaea, character units have a limit to their movement and attack ranges, based on level and weapons equipped. There are other special game factors that let you take advantage of the 3D battle map, many of which are unique to Disgaea. One of the many new feature to Disgaea 3 is the addition of a Geo Block, which creates a 3 dimensional battle instead of the traditional 2D. Geo Block is a cube-shaped terrain-altering object. Players can use it to access and attack enemies where normally they cannot reach. Geo Panel is a group of stat-altering elemental properties that are placed upon certain parts of the battlefield. When there are one or more colored panels on the battle grid, it means an element can affect that area. The effect can boost or reduce your unit's stats. Item World is a special randomly-generated battle stage within each and every item you find. By defeating these special battle stages, you are able to strengthen your items.</desc>

It features a "Best Match Mode" which enables alternate timelines; if Ippo defeats Date Eiji in this mode, he can become the champion sooner and challenge other boxers than he would have in the manga. Other non-canon matches include Miyata vs. Itagaki and Sawamura vs. Sendou.

		<desc>It is said that the one who becomes "Number One" will rule the world, wielding powers akin to a god. Someone becomes Number One by killing the previous Number One and taking his ceremonial headband. However, only the "Number Two" is allowed to challenge the Number One. Because of this, few people ever reach the Number One because the Number Two headband is constantly changing owners. Afro's father was the old Number One, until he was brutally killed by a gunman named Justice, an event witnessed by Afro as a child. Now an adult, Afro Samurai is the current Number Two and a master swordsman; he travels the road seeking revenge on Justice. Lengthy flashbacks interspersed throughout the story detail how Afro rose from frightened boy fleeing the death of his father, to master swordsman, and eventually to become the current "Number Two", while the story in the present deals with the adult Afro making his way to the mountain top keep of the "Number One" to duel Justice, while at the same time the mysterious cult known as the Empty Seven Clan sends various agents to kill Afro and take his Number Two headband.</desc>

		<desc>King's Quest is an ongoing episodic video game series developed by The Odd Gentlemen, published by Sierra Entertainment and distributed by Activision. It is a new re-imagining of the King's Quest series. While it is an adventure game like the previous games in the series, the interface is not fully point-and-click (the PC version only uses point and click for the dialogue and first person scenes). The game is one of several attempts at resurrecting or rebooting the King's Quest franchise. The new chapters are seen as neither a remake nor necessarily a sequel but a "re-imagining" (the original games are considered to be part of the canon of the new series, as each chapter will take place between those games, but previous games maybe reinterpreted in completely new ways (such as the reimagined dragon well scene inspired by events in King's Quest I)). It is not, however, considered King's Quest IX, according to Matt Korba. The game is to be released in five parts, with an optional playable Epilogue only included in King's Quest: The Complete Collection edition.</desc>

		<path>./Stuntman - Ignition (USA).m3u</path>
		<name>Stuntman : Ignition</name>
		<desc>Stuntman: Ignition is a game based on the original 2002 Stuntman game. Players assume the role of a Hollywood stunt driver working for a movie studio. Each level is based upon a movie and players will have to drive through the level, earning points by performing stunts. After the end of each level, players can review their performance by watching the movie trailer that was created. 
 
There are six movies to choose from, each with different settings, goals and challenges: Aftershock, Whoopin and a Hollerin' II, Strike Force Omega, Overdrive, Never Kill Me Again and Night Avenger. Each movie consists of 6 scenes where the goals set by the director must be followed. To progress, a successful series of stunts is required, but the amount of points can be increased by linking them together and adding extra danger by drifting, getting airborne, or getting close to other cars and obstacles. 
 
The multiplayer portion offers 2 game modes. In Backlot Battle players have to perform as many stunts as possible in a set amount of laps. Backlot Race offers straightforward racing where boost is earned through stunts. The PS2 version only offers offline gameplay, while the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions have multiplayer supported through the DemonWare middleware.</desc>

		<desc>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD is a downloadable title for PSN and Xbox LIVE Arcade that takes the best elements of the classic THPS games and gives them a fresh update to create an all new skateboarding experience. Tapping into fans' muscle memories, the gameplay returns to controllers and focuses on the satisfaction of linking sick tricks for maximum points. Combining sharp visuals with the best controls ever in a Tony Hawk game, the feel is cutting edge yet timeless. The game was rebuilt and polished by Robomodo using Neversoft's original code and includes the best seven levels from THPS and THPS2 (Warehouse, School 2, Mall, Phoenix, Hangar, Marseilles and Venice). There is a combination of new school and old school pros (Nyjah Huston, Chris Cole, Eric Koston, Andrew Reynolds, Rodney Mullen, Lyn-z Adams Hawkins Pastrana, Riley Hawk and Tony Hawk himself) and the soundtrack is half classic THPS tracks and fresh ones. Multiple online multiplayer modes round out the action!</desc>

		<desc>This is an action game in which players earn points for creating traffic pileups. From a top-down perspective, players initiate crashes by driving 'cartoony' vehicles (e.g., cars, trucks, vans, buses) into busy intersections; multiple crashes trigger score multipliers and rack up large 'bills' of property damage. Each level is accompanied by crashing sounds, small explosions, and vocal encouragement (e.g., 'Cool,' 'Maximum Carnage!'). In some levels, players are instructed to crash into police cars (e.g., 'Crash them before they bust you!'); in other sequences, oversized airplanes, tornados, lobster monsters, and UFOs slide across the screen, destroying any vehicles in their path.</desc>

In mere decades, the Chimera - a species of unknown origin propagating a virus that converts other life forms into more Chimera - has overrun Russia and all of Europe. Humanity’s hope for survival is slim, and the tide of the battle rests on the shoulders of U.S. Army Ranger, Sgt. Nathan Hale. Resistance: Fall of Man draws players into a deep, frightening story that rewrites the 20th century and pits the United States and Britain against a horrific species of unknown origin. In addition to an epic single player campaign, the game features co-op, split screen multiplayer and highly customizable online gameplay. Greater processing power on PlayStation 3 and Blu-ray technology enables more immersive visual and sound effects in Resistance: Fall of Man, heightening the chaos of large-scale warfare.

Similar to the NES game Ice Hockey, players are rated simply as fast, strong, or all-around, with obvious advantages and disadvantages for each. Conventional hockey rules are not enforced, and players are encouraged to physically block and check their opponents often. Big hits result in arcade-style powerups, like giant goalies, speed skating, and freeze-tag.</desc>

		<name>NBA JAM - On Fire Edition</name>
		<desc>The latest, downloadable-only addition to the franchise is NBA Jam: On Fire Edition, which builds upon the foundation laid by 2010's series-rebirthing NBA Jam, yet this is a far greater expansion on the formula than you may have been expecting – particularly at this price point. Rather than merely refreshing the rosters and adding a few new one-liners for the wisecracking commentator, the developers at EA Canada have made a surprising number of gameplay-balancing tweaks and additions, as well as overhauling the career mode and throwing a far more compelling unlock system into the mix.</desc>

		<name>Super Mega Baseball</name>
		<desc>Super Mega Baseball is a wonderfully goofy arcade baseball game that harkens back to the days of yore - by which I mean the 1990s. The whole time I was playing it, I couldn’t help but think how much my 10-year-old self would’ve killed for a game like this. It’s simple to pick up and play, it’s extremely fun in small doses, and yet it has a surprising amount of depth if you stick around. But you don’t have to be an ‘80s kid or even a huge baseball fan in order to have fun playing Super Mega Basebal.</desc>

		<path>./1942 Joint Strike.m3u</path>
		<name>1942 Joint Strike</name>
		<desc>1942: Joint Strike takes inspiration and influence from the 194X series of World War II-themed vertical shooters. The art, sound, and gameplay of the new game takes cues from the original 194X games, but stands out as its own unique entry. Gameplay resembles the classic 2D style that gamers expect, but the game utilizes a full 3D engine. Set in a World War II-themed locale, stages, vehicles, and weapons have the look and feel of WWII with some stylistic differences. The world in which 1942 takes place is not our own and the events that transpire are not historically accurate, nor are they intended to be. This is an alternate world where history and technology developed along their own paths. As a result, players jump into the cockpits of WWII-era aircraft to take on huge waves of incoming enemy fire, dodging explosions and missiles while challenging huge bosses at the end of each stage. New co-op "Joint Strike attacks" combine the powers of two aircrafts into a devastating barrage.</desc>
