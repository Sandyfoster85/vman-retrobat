		<name>Doshin the Giant</name>
		<desc>Doshin is all about playing God. Players star in the role of a yellow giant who, like the sun, ascends every morning from the sea to visit the peaceful inhabitants of a chain of tropical islands -- and much like the sun, the giant can bring both life and death. Your basic actions are walking, picking up objects or people, raising the terrain by pulling it up or lowering it by jumping on it. As you explore your surroundings, you encounter different tribes of island natives that go about their daily lives. The ultimate goal of the game is to help the different tribes flourish and get them to construct temples and henges to honor your giant. Each time a tribe builds such a structure, it is added to your monument journal. Released only on 64DD (with an even more obscure add-on disk released later), the game was remade for GameCube.</desc>

		<desc>Mario Artist: Polygon Studio is a Nintendo 64DD video game, and the last of the four Mario Artist video games. It was released in August of 2000 and was compatible with the Mario Artist: Communication Kit. With it, you could share your creations over the internet until February of 2001 when the service was discontinued. With the Polygon Studio, players could create their own 3D models with little detail.</desc>

		<path>./Mario Artist - Paint Studio.n64</path>
		<name>Mario Artist - Paint Studio</name>
		<desc>Mario Artist: Paint Studio is a Nintendo 64DD video game released late in 1999. The game is based off of the SNES classic Mario Paint, though instead of using the SNES Mouse it used the Nintendo 64 Mouse, which it came bundled with. It is a simple paint program where you can create portraits in a similar fashion to how you would in Microsoft Paint or Apple Works. There are various Nintendo based portraits and stamps that you can use in your paintings. With the use of the Capture Cartridge, players could import their images they've taken with the Game Boy Camera over to Paint Studio and alter them on a larger screen. The game was one of four Mario Artist games released on the 64DD. More were planned, though because the games proved unsuccessful they were never released.</desc>

		<desc>In Mario Artist: Talent Studio, the player can create their own characters in 3D, customizing features such as hair, skin, and eye color, voice, clothes, facial features, and body size and type. The process is similar to Nintendo's later Miis, but much more detailed. The characters can then be inserted into movies and animations. Events during these movies can be controlled by pressing the Z-trigger. Images from external video can be imported using the Capture Cartridge.</desc>

		<name>F-Zero X - Expansion Kit</name>
		<desc>F-Zero X Expansion Kit, released in Japan on April 21, 2000, is the first expansion disk for the 64DD, Nintendo's disk drive peripheral for the Nintendo 64. F-Zero X was programmed with "64DD hooks", which allow it to detect whether the 64DD is connected and compatible expansion software is loaded. This allows the cartridge-based game to be compatible with expansion disks such as track editors or course updates; however, none of these were utilized outside Japan due to the 64DD's commercial failure. Expansion Kit will only operate in conjunction with the cartridge of the original game. However, all of F-Zero X's regular features are accessible in addition to twelve new tracks, a car editor and a track creator. As the Expansion Kit benefits from a larger amount of storage on disk when compared to the original cartridge version, it includes new soundtracks in stereophonic sound as well as the entire collection of monaural audio tracks from the original game.</desc>
