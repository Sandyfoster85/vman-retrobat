		<desc>Alien Force places you in control of a space ship on a mission to destroy all enemy ships.  Destroy every ship on a level and you go up to the next level with more difficult enemies.  The action is showed from top-down, and you move around on a one-screen field with obstacles. You are only allowed to shoot one missile at a time, so the game is not about non-stop shooting.In the beginning levels, the enemy ships are easy, not even firing at you.  As you progress through the levels, the ships get harder and start to shoot at you.</desc>

		<desc>Aliens is a single player shareware game based on Taito's Space Invaders.  As with the classic Space Invaders game the player has a canon which they can move to the right and left along the base of the game window. The canon fires upwards at the descending alien ships. This game varies from the original game in a number of ways:  Here there are no buildings to hide behind.  In another variation from the original game the alien ships land and steal the planets resources, these ships must be destroyed once they take-off as if they reach the top of the screen the players score is reduced.  Finally, the player must protect defending craft as they take-off. Shooting these down by mistake also reduces the player's scoreThe game is entirely keyboard controlled. The player's score is displayed in the game's title bar as the game progresses, there is no high score feature.</desc>

Not only is there a strong narrative--in ten separate stories Inigo explores his house, his dream, the outside world, and Your Faithful Camel ventures as far afield as the North Pole--but where you click actually determines the course of the story. As children (ages 3 and up) move intuitively through one adventure after another, the combination of color animations, great sound effects, original music, and a variety of endings challenges and delights them. Ages three and up. No reading skills required.</desc>

		<desc>Amazing Mazez To Amaze is a Pac-Man variant. As in the original the player controls a spherical creature through mazes that has to eat all fruit it can find without being caught by the monsters that chase it. Special fruits give the power to kill all enemies within a short amount of time. Some differences exist from other Pac-Man variants. Each maze is larger than a single screen and slightly more complex in design. The game also offers multiple types of enemies: plasma-rookies, death-hunters, ant-lipus, and plasma-pros, each moving at a different speed. There are also stationary guns that shoot lasers the player has to watch out for. The player can shoot at the enemies on the other hand. For each ten fruits he collects he gets one shot. He has to be careful about the hunters though, since they become faster when respawning after being shot.</desc>

		<desc>ArtRageous! is a series of games and other interactive learning activities centered around art history. The learning adventure begins in a virtual plaza where the player/student can choose from a number of destinations to visit. Among the destinations are sizable, cross-referenced databases of both paintings and painter biographies.The main attraction of Artrageous! is the rich variety of activities present. The activities cover 5 categories of understanding and appreciating art: Color, light, perspective, composition, and the life of art. The color category includes a color mixing game in which you must use varying amounts of red, blue, and yellow components to build a hue/saturation color wheel. Another activity demonstrates the effect of adjusting the brightness or contrast of a picture. These and other activities are supplemented with narrated explanations of color concepts.The activities covering light include a sphere with lights placed around it-- click on one of the lights to understand the visual effects of different light sources. Also, a game that explains light demonstrates how outlines create shape. The player's goal is to match a number of outlines to their respective images within a mish-mash painting.One of the perspective category games is to arrange a roomful of floating objects where they would fit more appropriately on the painting backdrop. Both the painting and the objects are drawn with a 3D perspective which gives the player clues about placement. Further, the player can elect to bring up a vanishing point line grid for help.The composition section demonstrates how elements of paintings convey meaning. One game that illustrates this concept asks the player to match which shape or concept (circle, triangle, balanced scale, or unbalanced scale) best represents each of a selection of paintings.The life of art category features a jigsaw puzzle game using square pieces. The player must re-assemble the puzzle in a given period of time.</desc>

		<desc>Awesome Animated Monster Maker is a children's creative play computer video game program on CD-ROM, produced by ImaginEngine and published by Houghton-Mifflin's interactive Division in 1994. It was one of the first pieces of software made for young children, especially in the 2-5 age range. In Monster Maker, users create a monster by sticking together animated parts. Each part has several states to it: happy, sad, angry, etc. When a monster is happy or sad, all of its various parts animate together in the new state. Once a monster is created, one can play a variety of games and activities with it, such as making music, getting clothing and accessories, or printing it out. Monster Maker was designed for creative play, like a paint program. There were no overarching goals other than to have fun. Shortly after the first version, ImaginEngine released a follow-up called the Ultra Edition. It added four mini-games one can play with a monster, including judo and a water skiing race.</desc>

		<desc>Battle Sat is a shareware clone of the classic Battleship board game. However, here the conflict has left the oceans and has instead gone to the skies above.The player takes turns against the computer's AI in a race to destroy the opponent's Sats (or Satellites). Gameplay is very similar to the classic Battleship - There are three grids on the screen: The left grid shows your opponent's playfield and tells you if you've hit one of his Sats, or if you missed. The middle grid allows you to choose what area you will attack during your turn. The right grid displays your own Sats, their status, and the places where the opponent has already attacked. This continues until one side loses all their Sats.The main difference between the Battleship board game and this Windows-based implementation is that there are five Sat pieces in play, all different sizes. While the board game has two pieces that are two blocks in size, this version contains one piece that's two blocks in size, and one piece that's one block in size.</desc>

		<desc>BattleStar is basically a Battleship-variant for one player. The player controls a space ship which needs to kill all Zilog ships on the 8x8x8 game field. The game shows only one perspective at the time but by using one of the three scanners the perspective shifts and it also says how many enemy ships are on he chosen axis. Just like in Battleship he doesn't know where these ships exactly are. He has to aim his airship's gun to a certain coordinate - if he hits an enemy ship, it gets destroyed. The position also gets marked so he doesn't shoot the same field twice. The Zilog ships don't shoot back - the difficulty are the limited fuel and rocket reserves which are reduced with every movement respectively shot. There are overall three difficulty settings.</desc>

The game starts with the beetle being positioned in one cell, from that point the player has six seconds before the game starts. The objective of the game is to keep the beetle moving for as long as possible. Points are scored for each cell the beetle passes over, specific cells that score bonus points and, in later levels, there are special bonus paths. The player must attain a predefined level in order to progress to the next. The game can be speeded up and the when that happens the point scores are doubled.</desc>

		<desc>Betrayal in Antara uses an updated version of the game engine from Betrayal at Krondor. However, it does not continue the Raymond E. Feist's Riftwar saga, but instead starts a new tale set in a different fantasy world, known as Ramar.The story begins with William Escobar, the son of the governor of Pianda, sailing home to meet his fiancee. The ship is attacked by pirates, and William escapes in a life boat with a mortally wounded traveler. Before he dies, the stranger gives William a medallion, warning him of a conspiracy against the Empire. William meets a young magician named Aren, who has just discovered devastating powers within himself, and the two decide to meet William's father and ask for his advice concerning the unsettling information.The game plays very similarly to Betrayal at Krondor. The player navigates a party of three characters through the 3D world. Enemy encounter triggers a separate battle screen, on which player-controlled party and the enemies engage in turn-based combat. Cities are usually displayed as still pictures, with various locations accessible via menu-based navigation. Like in Betrayal at Krondor, there are only two character classes in the game, warrior and mage. The skill system is also nearly identical, skills are improved by repeatedly using them, and marking them in the skill menu for faster learning. Elements like a day/night cycle, weapon and armor repairing, navigation on world map, the necessity to carry rations, etc. are also brought over from the earlier  Dynamix game.</desc>

"Obelisk" was the name given to it by the original designers when it was completed in 1995, but it was never published under that name. DreamCatcher picked it up for publishing 2 years later under the name Beyond Time, appropriate because the story does involve time travelling.Rifts in time have occurred causing people and precious artifacts and treasures to disappear mysteriously all over the world. Travel to ancient Egypt, Tibet, the Yucatan peninsula and Atlantis to find the missing masterpieces of the world and repair time itself. Only your puzzle-solving skills can save humanity from impending doom.</desc>

Your PC deals the cards and arranges the game, making complex variations or draw and stud poker easy to learn and play. While anyone can learn to play poker, to play well requires a balance of wits and guts. That's why eight different characters are included with Bicycle Poker, all dying to separate you from your chips.

Draw Poker:
This familiar form of poker offers beginners and experts alike a chance to hone their skills in the basics. On line rules list the priority of hands and a handy table displays the play for each player in each hand of the game. Once you have mastered the five-card draw, add some wild cards and see how they affect the odds, or try your hand at Stud Poker.

Stud Poker:
In contrast to Draw Poker, Stud Poker is the game that truly tests the mettle of players. Available in five, six, and seven-card variations, Stud Poker allows you to gauge the strength of your opponents' hands, but also leaves the game open to bluffing. With only one "Hole-Card," five-card stud involves more skill, bluffing and guile than five-card draw.</desc>

		<desc>Brain Games For Windows contains seven puzzle games bundled together. The games included are: Achi - You play against the CPU. The game is similar to Tic-Tac-Toe, however, if a stalemate occurs, each player can move one of their tiles and possibly get a game-winning line. Bastille - The object of the game is to remove buttons from the game board. You do so by moving one button over another, you can only jump over one button at a time, and the place where you land has to be empty. The game includes five different button patterns, each one more difficult than the last. Battle Sat - Originally released as a standalone game, this is a Battleship clone where you must shoot down your opponents Satellites before he shoots down your own. The game plays exactly like Battleship - you select points in a grid and fire at them. If you land a hit, the point will turn red, and you'll have a clue as to where the enemy's Satellites are located. The player who destroys the enemy's Satellites first wins. Double Block - This is a simple Memory game. You have to uncover tiles and match them before your opponent does so you can win the game. You can change the opponent's skill level and the colors used in the grid, a single player mode is also available. Jumper - A simple puzzle game, you have to move the red blocks on the right side to the left side of the screen. The blocks will only move if there is an empty space next to it, or if you've moved a block right next to it. Knight - The object of the game is to swap the position of the Red Knights (on top) with the Blue Knights (below) in 16 moves by using nothing but knight moves. Tic-Tac-Toe - The classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Place Xs or Os in a line across, down or diagonally before your opponent does the same.</desc>

		<desc>Brainwave is a single player shareware game that is a sort of cross between  Space Invaders  and Galaxian.Though it looks like a space shoot 'em up the premise for the game is  much closer to home. Nanobots have been surgically implanted into the player's brain to repair damage caused by watching too much television.  However as they went about their work the nanobots achieved intelligence of their own and in order to survive they are now feeding on the player's brain.  The good news is that the player's imagination has created a ship that will destroy the nanobots and so the battle commences.There are nine scenarios in the full game with three being made available in the shareware release. This is a keyboard controlled game with the arrows moving the ship left / right  and the space bar firing the ship's weapon. These is no up/down movement. Once a wave of nanobots has been cleared the game displays the player's score before presenting the next wave which the game claims to configure by analysing  the player's game style.  Some nanobots leave a power crystal behind that, if captured, upgrades the players weapons.The game has sound, music, a high score table and re-definable keys.</desc>

		<desc>BrainWave 2 is a single player shareware game that combines the control system of  Space Invaders  with the swooping enemy formations of Galaxian. It is a sequel to Dexterity Software's  BrainWave.Once again nanobots are attacking the player's brain and the player's imagination has created a ship with which to fight them.  Like its predecessor this is a keyboard controlled game with the arrows moving the ship left / right  and the space bar firing the ship's weapon. These is no up/down movement.When a wave of nanobots has been cleared the game displays the player's score before presenting the next wave. Destroyed enemy ships leave behind power crystals which, if collected, can be used to buy power ups such as more effective weapons, shields and special features before the next wave commences.  With each successive level the enemy ships also evolve, getting power ups of their own making them harder to hit and giving them better weapons. The player starts with three lives, new lives are added for every 300,000 points scored. When a life is lost all the crystals that have been collected are lost. The full game has three scenarios, only one of which is available in the shareware release. Some weapons and features are also available only in the registered release.</desc>

		<desc>Masque Caribbean Stud Poker is an officially licensed simulation of a casino card game for 1 - 4 players where either the computer or real people can take the role of players 2,3 &amp; 4.  The game starts with each player placing a bet or "Ante" in the treasure chest lid area of the table. The cards are then dealt, all the player(s) cards are dealt face down but the top card of the dealers hand is placed face up. Each player in turn decides whether their hand will beat the dealers. If the player thinks there's a chance of beating the dealer they choose to bet on their hand which causes chips to the value of the original bet to be transferred from their stack to the table. If the player does not think they can beat the dealer then they fold and lose their original bet. The dealer then reveals their cards and players who have beaten the dealer are paid.  A feature of this version of poker is that the dealer must have an Ace and a King or better in their hand in order to qualify, if they do not have this minimum requirement in their hand then the dealer loses and anyone still in the game, regardless of what is in their hand, will win.  Winnings are based the strength of a players hand with two pairs paying out double the bet and four of a kind paying twenty times the bet. In addition there is a progressive bonus payout for hands that contain a flush or better.The game allows the player to change various settings such as the speed of the deal, the minimum &amp; maximum bet and to set automatic reminders for the progressive bet and other gaming situations. It also includes a CD player so that the player can listen to their own music during the game.The game can be played entirely with the mouse, bets being made by dragging &amp; dropping chips onto the table or by clicking on the stack. Alternatively the game can be played entirely via the keyboard or by a combination of the two.  There are no save game feature or network play features in this game.</desc>

This is multiplied about 30 times because every enemy on the level is allowed a move for every one of yours, but they don't all know where you are right away. It has a good and somewhat optional storyline, for the replay factor. When you create a new character you can distribute ability points between three characteristics, and select their gender and name. The levels and weapon abilities are randomly generated for an extremely high replay value.</desc>

You are allowed to move a single space in one direction (up) if no jumps are available.  If you are able to jump an opponent's piece, you must do so.  Jumping an opponent's piece (or pieces if you can do a multiple jump), captures the piece(s).If you get any of your pieces to the farthest end of the board, you are "kinged".  This means that your piece can now move in any direction, offering a distinct advantage.The game allows for 0 to 2 human players.  The computer will make up the remaining players to equal 2 players total.  You can choose to play as red or black, and can even switch sides.</desc>

		<desc>Chinese Solitaire is a single player card game.

Superficially the game resembles Klondike solitaire in that some of the cards are face up and they are built into sequences of descending rank and alternating colour.

Forty-nine cards are dealt into seven stacks of seven cards. The first four stacks are dealt face up, the remainder have three cards face down and four cards face up. Cards can be moved between the stacks either singly or on blocks, the only rule being that the card selected must be placed on a card of the opposite colour and one higher in rank - so a seven of hearts could be placed on the eight of spades for example. An empty stack can only be filled by moving a king into it.

The object is to transfer all the cards to the foundations building from ace to the king, the author states that with practice this can be achieved in around one hand in three.

The game has no undo feature, no hint feature, and is played entirely with the mouse</desc>

		<desc>Cinema Volta is a memoir, a quirky performance piece, an ear-popping and eye-grabbing reverie about electricity and its transforming power. In twelve stories that pulsate and migrate across the screen, narrator Jim Petrillo considers the strange lives of great inventors of the nineteenth century: Alessandro Volta, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, Samuel Morse, and Nicola Tesla. But don't expect a dry treatise on the history of science. Petrillo's idiosyncratic perspective takes in the history of Sicily, Shelley and Byron's shenanigans during the summer of 1816 (Byron's daughter, Ada, wrote the first computer program), Joyce's X-rated love letters to Nora (the program takes its name from a movie theater opened by Joyce in Trieste in 1909), the cave paintings of Lascaux, Frankenstein, naked people, vampires, big noise, and the artist's own childhood memories. Often ironic (electricity was first used, he notes, to make dead frogs twitch), Petrillo's commentary weaves together an arresting collage of images and text. The subtitle promises "Weird Science and Childhood Memories." Weird it is, and not for everyone. But like any cult favorite, it has its fans.</desc>

		<desc>Clue is a full-motion video adaptation of the popular board game of the same name. It is an amalgamation of two earlier CD-i titles where (up to six) players take turns investigating a mansion where a murder happened, uncovering clues and evidence to reveal the assassin. There are three storylines with four difficulty levels, each with a unique solution making it altogether twelve different mysteries:Deadly PatentMr.Boddy steals a formula to produce artificial rubies from Professor Plumm.The Road to DamascusMr.Boddy almost dies in a car accident. He is rescued by the monks of the Order of Silence. Upon his return, he decides to join the order and give his fortune to it.BlackmailMr.Boddy convinces all his acquaintances to invest on Bolders Brewery.The movement system, where the player moves the cursor to a portion of the screen and clicks on it to move or turn to that direction is similar to the one found in the The 7th Guest. Inside the rooms the screen switches to a 360║ panorama that can be scrolled by moving the cursor to its edges. Clicking on clocks starts a flashback video of what happened on the room before the crime was committed. Clicking on suspects brings up the interrogation screen, where they can be inquired about weapons, their alibis, etc. Clicking on secret passages transports the player to another room. Clicking on the bell calls the butler and the accusation menu, where the player chooses the weapon and the murderer. Afterwards, the butler informs if the player made the right choice. A notebook keeps track of all the information collected, and can be accessed at any time.Each of the four difficulty levels have a different number of accusations available (3 on the easiest level, 1 on the hardest one). In the easier levels the room positions are fixed, while in the tougher levels they are random.In each player's turn they can perform two moves, two actions or a action and a move. A move is defined by entering and leaving a room. A action is defined by examining items, interrogating suspects or watching a flashback.</desc>

		<desc>Comic books finally get the respect they deserve. Combining interviews, historical footage, animation, and montages of comic book art, Comic Book Confidential traces the development of the comic book from the very first (Funnies on Parade), in 1933, through counterculture favorites (Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers) to the hippest representatives of the 1980s comic book revival (The Dark Knight returns). Ron Mann's witty, incisive movie in QuickTime contains interviews with influential authors and artists of commercial, alternative, and underground comics. Many read from their works: Marvel master Stan Lee brings Spiderman's money worries to life, Charles Burnes becomes Big Baby, Jack Kirby reenacts the birth of Caption America. The CD-ROM adds over 120 pages of comics by the film's featured artists. Scott McCloud, author of "Understanding Comics", provides new introductions. Also included are biographies of all the artists, and checklists of their published works. It all adds up to a new way to explore America's only purely indigenous art form.</desc>

		<desc>Sketch Turner was a starving comic book artist, living with his pet rat Roadkill... that is until a lightning storm mysteriously brought his cartoon villain, Mortus, to life and imprisoned Sketch within the pages of his own comic book. Now trapped in the world that he himself created, but someone else is now drawing, Sketch must battle through the pages of his own comic book, and past his own creations, to a final battle with Mortus. Perhaps one of his own creations, General Alissa Cyan might be able to help...Comix Zone is a side-scrolling fighting game with a difference, you're inside of a comic book and you yourself know it. Smash enemies into the sides of frames, rip through the paper to unleash a super move and otherwise wreck havoc throughout the limitations of the graphic novel. Sketch himself can jump, attack and use various items that he finds along the comic book, including his rat friend, Roadkill. Button combinations can be used to unleash powerful techniques.The game progresses linear through each page of the comic book, however secret paths and alternate routes through the story can be discovered. At the end of each level, Sketch receives a super hero rating for how well he's progressing.</desc>

		<desc>Explore the Pulitzer Prize-winning graphic novel in ways never before possible with this special interactive CD-ROM edition. The Complete MAUS combines Volumes I and II with sketches, video, and supplementary documents to give the reader a unique look at this moving work. When it first appeared in 1986, MAUS, Art Spiegleman's memoir of his father's experiences during the Holocaust, was hailed as a powerful work of history. It represented a new level of maturity for a century-old art form, namely comix, which to that point had mostly been a medium for superhero fantasies and funny animal stories. With the appearance of MAUS, the point was made simply and clearly that a comixture of words and pictures could be used to portray any subject matter 0 even one so fare removed from the traditional comix subject matter as the genocide and persecution of Polish and German Jews during the years surrounding the Second World War. The Complete MAUS CD-ROM grants the user unprecedented access to the historical and structural details behind the finished book. The pages of MAUS are linked to preliminary sketches, alternate drafts, archival photographs, and drawings made by prisoners and audio from the interviews between Art Spiegelman and his father that were the basis for the narrative. In addition, there is QuickTime video and audio of Art Spiegelman discussing the making of MAUS, and critical commentary on the form, ideas, and history behind this powerful, groundbreaking work.</desc>

		<desc>Congo is an adventure game adapted from the 1995 movie of the same name. The plot revolves around a search for a diamond that presumably have power enough to change the world of telecommunications as we know it. On a mission issued by Travis, the head of TraviCom, you are sent in contemporary Congo in order to recover the diamond and find out what has happened to another expedition led by Dr. Karen Ross.  As you arrive at the place of you destination more and more pieces of the puzzle begin to fit together in a wholesome picture as even more  questions arise. Who are the monster gorillas populating the area? What is the meaning of all the Egyptian writings found throughout the place? What drives Amy -- a sentient gorilla capable of speech, to help you? And most importantly -- how to survive and get hold of the precious diamond and, perhaps, save the unfortunate souls of the first expedition in the process.The gameplay is that of a classical inventory-based adventure. Although occasionally the game does depart from the formula. It mostly concerns the sequences where player should operate a multi-functional device resembling a laptop. With it's use player is able to analyze visual images to gain clues, record audio, track homing signals on the map and examine additional info from the  files downloaded from the TraviCom network. Other notable gameplay features include navigating a river by boat and a maze-like sequence in the middle of the game.Visually the game is similar to the first-person adventure games of it's era tracing its roots to Myst. It contains the same pre-rendered 3D backgrounds with the smoothly animated transition sequences and the characters done in live-action, except for Amy who is also executed in pre-rendered 3D. The game is supplied with the trailer of the afore-mentioned 1995 movie.</desc>

		<desc>The object of the game is to be the first player to reach 121 points. The current point totals are shown in two different ways. The values are shown in the ""Computer's Score"" and ""Player's Score"" score box. These same values are also represented as pegged values on the cribbage board. The computer's pegs are yellow and the player's pegs are blue. The pegs always go up the outside and down the inside. If the winner reaches 121 before the opponent gets 91, this is called a skunk and is considered as two games won (and double the money). If the opponent doesn't reach 61 this is considered a Double Skunk and is quadruple(four times the money). The players obtain points by forming various counting combinations as pairs, triplets, fours, sequences and fifteens. Combinations can be formed when playing the cards, or when counting the hands and crib in conjunction with the starter card.</desc>

		<desc>An historical adventure game set in the Middle Ages at the time that the Franks were beginning to be driven out of Jerusalem. The player follows the adventure of Artaud, a disgraceful French Lord, who is sent to redeem himself by traveling to the Holy Lands to escort the True Cross back to safety. This is done through a series of scenes, with narration. The player has to complete certain tasks before Artaud can progress to the next scene. These tasks are generally of an educational nature, such as learning how sieges on castles were carried out, or who the main forces in the Holy Lands were at the time. Whilst Artaud's quest is fictional (with some added supernatural events), the setting is quite real, with actual locations visited and use of historic figures.Artaud's quest will see his home in Dun-le-Roy wasted in a siege, travel across the Mediterranean to the port of Acre, and eventually to the Holy City of Jerusalem. Along the way historical information is provided on events and lifestyles of the period.The game's style has a 3rd-person perspective and uses digital footage of real actors again photo-realistic (for the time) backdrops, which are partially animated. Intertwined with the scenes is an encyclopaedia, which it is necessary to interact with in order to complete the tasks and fully understand the narrative. The structure of most of the tasks involves collecting items from the scenes and the encyclopaedia by dragging them into your inventory, and then re-arranging them on to the task screen. The game is very similar in style to 1998's Vikings.</desc>

A picture is shown on a banner overhead. The player's task is to choose the animal carrying a picture that rhymes with the overhead picture, in one variation. In another variation, the player must choose the picture whose word begins with the same letter as the picture from the banner.  Fun House: A picture is shown in the middle of the house. Random people pop out of windows holding letters. When the next letter in the word comes up, the player must click it and drag it to the top of the house to assemble the word.  Comedy Clowns: A pile of clowns get mixed up and the player will have to pair them back up. One clown gets up on stage and holds a banner of an ending letter. The task is to scan through the other clowns and find the one who is holding a picture whose word ends with the same letter seen on stage. Make a match and the 2 clowns exchange a joke.  Sammy The Musical Seal: Sammy the seal plays five horns. But they don't play music until the player chooses five pictures from among eight that have a particular vowel.  Peanut Pickup: This is somewhat of a Pac-Man clone. The peanut vendors are sloppy and Curious George, riding an elephant, must clean up after them. Along the way, a peanut vendor will appear, who is carrying a picture whose first letter begins with a certain goal letter. Capture that peanut vendor for more points.  Thea's Story Theater: Choose from a variety of stories to be read, and acted out by the characters involved. Upon exiting the game, Curious George presents the player with a printable certificate stating how you performed at the various educational tasks.</desc>

		<desc>Dagger's Rage is a sci-fi action adventure that tries to capitalize on the market made popular by games like Elite and Privateer.  You are a mercenary with your own starfighter, and it's up to you to stop a new pirate menace that has been ravaging the shipping lanes and innocent people of the United Planets.You choose your own missions and contracts, and uncover the plot as you progress.  As you win more contracts, you gain more funds to purchase new ships and weapons.The main difference between Dagger's Rage and another game that might be compared to it -- i.e. Privateer -- is that this is less a space sim and actually is quite arcade-ish.  You control your ship through a top-down view, and combat plays like a toned-down shooter such as Tyrian.  Battles take place on various planets and in space.  The terrain, however, is 3D.</desc>

		<desc>Following in the footsteps of the early UNIX game Robots (and perhaps from there the still-earlier BASIC game Chase?), this game puts the player in charge of a little protagonist, often claimed to be The Doctor, occupying a position on a top-down grid which is otherwise strewn, not with mines, but with those killer cyborgs which are his personal nemesis, the Daleks.  They have no long-range weapons, but if they touch him, he will find himself ex-ter-min-ated!Fortunately for him, contact with them is as lethal to each other as it is to him.  Every time he takes a step, they all draw one square closer to him, The Doctor's cunning strategy is to manoeuvre himself so as to cause their paths to intersect and the Daleks to terminally collide, leaving a pile of rubble dangerous both to him and to subsequent Daleks -- a strategy not always possible on the narrow confines of a grid.  Fortunately for the good Doctor, where this game outdoes its predecessors is that he also has his trusty Sonic Screwdriver in hand, whose offensive use destroys all Daleks within a threatening one-square radius of him.  Also, it allows him to teleport out of harm's way to a random location on the map -- hopefully one behind a pile of Dalek rubble, and not one within a single step of a Dalek currently on the map.  In many versions both Sonic Screwdriver and Teleport use are limited.  Should The Doctor survive this onslaught, he is brought to a new grid map, generally one populated with still further Daleks.Other features particular to some versions and absent from others include the use of graphical tiles vs. mere roguelike textmode character representation, and occasionally a conversion will use (universally unlicensed) sound effects taken from canonical Doctor Who sources, more commonly these games also offer a Last Stand command, to be used, like the "drop" in Tetris, when the player is so confident in the security of their location that they are willing to sit tight and grant the Daleks as many moves as it takes to either reach The Doctor or be rendered down into scrap metal through unforeseen collision.  Successful use of the Last Stand often results in a score bonus, unsuccessful use of it, of course, results in The Doctor's death.  (Don't worry, chances are good that he'll regenerate into a new incarnation -- not in this game, however.)Some versions feature keyboard directional control (in which sometimes the player is granted access to diagonal movement like the Daleks are, and </desc>

		<desc>An graphic adventure from a first-person point of view, run in Windows, rather than the usual DOS of the time. Tyler, the main character, is caught in his dreams. Wandering the streets of his dream world, his has to pick up and put to use things that would not normally be used in adventure games of its time, like dirty underwear or sewage. But don't think this is a gross or childish game. While it isn't tremendously challenging or diverse (the play control is very similar to that of Myst), it is still very original. And as Tyler discovers something terribly wrong with the state of his dreams, he must also find a way to escape, which is only half the fun.</desc>

		<desc>Who can save the citizens of Compli City from the sinister threat of mind-numbing boredom? The Dazzeloids, of course! They are: Stinkabod Lame (daredevil, prankster, slamdancer), Yendor Talbneerg (technoid supreme), and Titan Rose (muscleman and poet). Their commander is Anne Dilly Whim, out to avenge her sister's death of boredom in front of the TV. Together, they battle the Mediogre, head of the Blando Corporation and power-mad capitalist worm, and his techno-weasel sidekick, Pin Bleeper. In "A Child is Bored" the Dazzeloids save little Jeremy Gerbilman from brainwashed zombification (too much Blando television!). Their mission in "Banker, Spare that Petshop" is to rescue the smelly but lovable Probe and Poke Petshop from the void of the Mediogre's Transglumifier. The story lines change depending on which character you send to the rescue, so learn what goes on inside their heads in the music-video-inspired "Dazzeloid Dreams." Dazzeloids is crammed with brilliant animation, strange poems and infectious songs, narrated text with definitions of real and made-up words, crazy sound effects, and enough absurd surprises to entertain for hours. Boredom is banished when the Dazzeloids hit town!</desc>

		<desc>This early, authorized freeware remake of the puzzle game from 1987 updates the graphics and sounds while maintaining the original gameplay. Each level is a puzzle room filled with obstacles and viewed from above, where the objective is to use a series of mirrors to guide a laser beam towards a receiver device and complete the stage. The mirrors are stationary, but can be rotated to deflect the light to several directions, with some turning automatically all the time. The player must configure the mirrors and carefully avoid the mines and walls that reflect the laser back to itself, causing the emitting device to overload and explode. Bomb detonators have to be activated and destroyed to open a passage to the receiver. Other features change the behavior of the laser: the prism bends the light in random 90║ angles, the optical fiber nodes act as a portals, transporting the beam to another place of the board, logical doors have internal mirrors that absorb or deflect the laser when hit at the correct orientation. This remake received a new version in 2006.</desc>

Gameplay consists of a myst-like game of "slideshows" but without puzzles to solve, most of the game progresses through dialogue and interaction, so you mission really consists of talking to the right person at the right times.The game features digitized actors as well as multiple endings plus, of course, millions of Devo-related jokes, characters etc.</desc>

Some bricks are colored, and can only be destroyed by a similar-colored ball. Hit color-changing bricks to make this happen. Other bricks are diamond bricks, and can only be destroyed once all the colored bricks have been destroyed. There are also key and lock bricks, which function as one might expect, and magic bricks, which have unusual effects. Finally, the paddle can hold the ball in place, by using energy which is recharged whenever the ball hits the paddle. 50 levels are included, and the game is saved every 5 levels.</desc>

Your goal is to find the human village so you may you join your kin once again. Mowgli is an athletic individual, and can jump, run, swing on vines or climb them without any problems. Most of the animals he comes upon, however, are inexplicably hostile, so he must defend himself with a variety of thrown weapons, such as bananas and boomerangs. To complete each level, Mowgli must collect a number of crystals (how many - it depends on the difficulty levels) within a time limit. A compass in the corner of the screen helps him by showing the direction where the nearest crystal is.</desc>

		<desc>Dodger is a game in the style of Pac-Man. In Pac-Man the player has to eat all the dots from the board in order to pass to the next level. In this game the dots are replaced by fruits (apple, strawberry and cherry) that the player has to eat in order to get a score and to go to the next level. The enemies are four mean laser machines in the sides of the levels and they attack the player by shooting lasers. When the character is hit, a life is lost. Unlike Pac-Man there are no special pills in the game. The board also contains skulls and they also make the character lose a life upon contact. After every level a password is provided to continue playing from that level immediately.</desc>

		<desc>Dogz: Your Computer Pet is the first game entirely based on caring for a virtual pet, even before the Tamagotchis became popular. From the title screen players can choose one of the five available puppies and interact with them using the mouse. The dog can be picked up and dragged around, and it lives on the player's desktop. The dog needs to be fed and you can play with them, scold them, and teach them tricks. It is also possible to take pictures and design a playpen for them. In other applications the dog can grab your attention by holding on to the cursor, or you can throw a ball to keep it busy while doing something else.When the dog is not fed or cared for, for a long time, it dies. This concept was also used as a business incentive. The game was distributed freely, but only came with five days of food. Because without food the dog would die in the demo version, this encouraged players to pay the $20 to get the full game and an unlimited amount of food.</desc>

		<desc>Dole 5 A Day Adventures is an educational title produced in conjunction with the Dole Food Company aimed at teaching children about nutrition. This is primarily an American title, all the examples and information are geared to which US stares grow this crop or which countries in the world supply the US with that crop.
The game's installation creates a program group on the player's computer with two icons one of which is the game and the other, 'Support Materials', is a set of notes for teachers on getting the most out of the product.

The game itself takes place on Banana Boulevard, a street which which has five buildings on it. Each building represents a set of informational hosted by an animated vegetable of fruit, for example Pamela Pineapple hosts the show in the Adventure Theater. The buildings are:

* Adventure Theater: here the player selects a piece of produce and can then view fun facts, where in the USA it is grown, which other countries supply the USA, pictures and a short video clip

* Salad Factory: is where the player combines ingredients to make a salad and can see just how much vitamin A &amp; C, fibre and fat their creation contains.

* H.B.'s Body Shop: In the body shop the player selects parts of H.B.'s body and learns which fruit and vegetables are beneficial say for muscle growth.

* The Cook's Kitchen: Here the player selects kitchen items and is given details of appropriate recipes such as 'Carrots in the Microwave' , 'Spunky Vegetable Pizza', 'Fruity Breakfast Parfait', and 'Trees in a Broccoli Forest'

* Leafy Green Travel: this is takes the player to 'The Land of 5 A Day' where there are five more game areas.: Information Land, Pyramid Land, Label Land, Serving Size Land, and Market Land.


As the player exits any location they are asked if they wish to 'Take The Challenge' which tests the player's knowledge of the information in that section.  All challenges are earn tokens which are used to complete a game board. If the player scores the maximum number of points in a section then they are certified in that area. Challenges can be retaken but the questions change each time. When all challenges have been completed successfully the game board pathway is complete and the player becomes a certified '5 a Day Kid'.
From the game's menu bar the player can access and play any of the game's songs, print recipes, certificates and access a glossary of key words.

		<desc>Here we have an expanded version of the author's earlier Dopefish Lives! featuring two- and four-player modes, but no single-player game.  In addition to the "fishfest" mode, which reproduces the original game's simple schoolfish-eating game (but makes it competitive -- who can eat the most the fastest?), this game also takes a nod from the FPS revolution its parent companies spawned and features two- and four-player deathmatches (aka "dopematch"es) where the players must line themselves up properly to eat a schoolfish precisely at the moment when they're facing an opponent, as the food quickly gets converted and expelled back out as a kind of shot.  Four dopes enter. One dope leaves. That is the dopematch law in Dopefish Forever!</desc>

		<desc>Taking its name from a secret message in Rise of the Triad, this game takes the famous ravenous green burping fish antagonist of the underwater levels of Commander Keen 4, the Dopefish, and, for the first time, takes him out beyond the role of easter egg and puts the player in charge of him.  The player swims around the screen and opens the goofy fish's gaping maw by hitting the Ctrl key... hopefully timed appropriately for when a little schoolfish might just be swimming in.  (And then... indicating its appreciation with a resounding belch.)Upon consuming a certain allotment of fishies, levels proceed, first adding coral obstacles and then exploding mines.  Still later levels feature the Sprite actively harassing the Dopefish.  After sustaining three wounds, the meal is done!</desc>

		<desc>Let Dr. Ditto challenge your children's problem solving skills, while they are having fun! Like yesterday's memory games, players use a set of "mosaic" tiles to find the matches. Unlike those games, these puzzles come alive after your child successfully completes them. Through the magic of multimedia, Dr. Ditto himself appears on screen to provide fun and informative explanations of the game's theme.
Dr. Ditto contains two types of games: Lotto and Memory. Each game has over 100 colorful decks. The decks are divided into categories, as shown by nine buttons on the question mark screen. To go to each category and see what the deck contains, just click on one of the nine buttons. You will be given a fun multimedia tour of the subject you have chosen and given several deck options.
Lotto: Match the card at the bottom the screen with its mate up top by clicking and dragging it up. When all the cards are matched, you win!
Memory: To find the cards that match, click on the backs of the cards to turn them over. When you find one you have seen before, click on its mate to make them both disappear. When the board is clear, you win!
Dr. Ditto encourages participation with lively lessons on history, airplanes, trucks, animals, colors, language, and more. Its pictures, puzzles, and patterns will educate and entertain. The multiple game format will keep your child's interest, even on the rainiest of days. Dr. Ditto is designed to be used by children at home, so they can help their parents share the fun. It will be a delightful learning experience for all!</desc>

		<desc>Dr. Drago's Madcap Chase (a.k.a. Die total verrⁿckte Rallye)  is a strategy game for up to eight players with similarities to board games like Monopoly. The players join a rally through Europe and North Africa which consists of several stages. At the beginning of each stage a TV moderator names the capital of a country. The one who gets there first will win a lot of money. At first there are only Western European countries available but eventually the Berlin Wall falls and you can enter the former Eastern bloc.You play on a map of Europe consisting of many fields merged with each other through lines. Before every turn a player dices and then he can move his figure over the fields. You can freely decide the route to your target but you have to notice on which field you would end your turn. There are: Red fields: When you end your turn on a red field, you'll lose money.  Blue fields: Money will be credited to your account.  Yellow fields: You get a playing card. You can use these cards before every turn to your own advantage (i.e. use five dices instead of one) or to your opponent's disadvantage (i.e. having him transferred to a corner of the map).  Purple fields: On a purple field you can buy or sell cards.  Gray fields: Gray fields are cities. In a city you can buy buildings and earn rent every turn. When you own every building in a city, you have a monopoly and earn more rent. Contrary to Monopoly you don't have to pay anything when you come to a city where one of the other players have buildings.  Black and white fields: These fields represent the capital of a country. Buying buildings there is much more expensive but you will earn more rent.Another aspect of the game is Dr. Drago. Drago is played by the computer and appears after stage one and will follow the player who had the highest distance to the target of the previous stage. After every turn Drago will waste parts of your money, sell or buy buildings to terrible prices or destroy your cards. To get rid of him you can use a Drago playing card (if you own one and Drago has not ripped it to pieces yet) or overtake one of the players. When you pass them, Drago will leave you and chase your opponent. The winner of the game is the one who has the most money on his account after all stages. You could even win without winning a single stage but it's more difficult because you won't make that much profit with trying to end your turns on blue fields. And of course, Drago will haunt you the whole time when y</desc>

		<desc>Duck City is a wacky and fun collection of 6 action and puzzle games designed for kids of all ages. Designed by Alan Snow, creator of P.A.W.S, Duck City stars a talking cartoon duck who wanders around in his cartoon world, getting into one trouble after another. In one mini-game that is similar to basketball, you will see how a duck can pull off spectacular slam dunks. In the farm, you must fatten slugs by feeding them cabbages. The barber shop is the site of one of the game's most unique games: here, you cut and dry customers' hair to make cool haircuts. In the garage, you can participate in a fun cross-country racing. And finally in a lab, you can tinker with various gadgets and interact with RoboDuck, a cross between RoboCop and a duck. All the games are simple to learn and easy to use - you need to memorize only a few keys and mouse clicks. With attractive and creative cartoon graphics, fun mini-games, and a transparent and intuitive interface, Duck City is a fun "interactive environment" for everyone in the family. None of the game has lasting play value, but they are ideal for a 5-10 minute coffee break at the office... or a fun evening for the kids in your house.</desc>

Rin will revisit these lands often during the game. To solve the quest, the player may even have to die and reincarnate nine times, causing the player to play the game from the perspective of nine different characters.

Indeed, you can do pretty much everything a typical dolphin does, including eating fish, surfacing in order to breathe, using your biological sonar and of course, jumping out of the water to amaze your friends.

The storyline is actually deeper that one may think by looking at the box illustration. As Ecco, you are the only dolphin who managed to escape from a giant whirlpool which sucked down your entire pod. The five shining stars on your forehead show that you are the chosen one to save them. But that task will be not be an easy one, as you will have to travel through time and space with the Atlantean time machine, and meet the mystical Asterite in order to defeat the Vortex Queen.</desc>

Every element has unique troops which differ in moving range, life energy and combat strength. To win the game you either have to defeat the other elements or find three of your own tokens which appear regularly on the game field and are guarded by a warden.The field is divided into five areas: Four triangles are the "homelands" of the elements in which the own troops regenerate. The rest are neutral zones. The two outer rows of each triangle rotate after every round clockwise so that every eight rounds the field is again in the original shape. Then every player may revive a dead unit or refresh a used spell. It is possible to set the enemy's AI to a special attribute like "collector" or "conqueror".</desc>

		<desc>In this adventure game the player controls an archaeologist who is looking for artifacts on Tarsus. But while searching the ruins he falls into a trap door and is suddenly in a big underground complex. Now he has to find a way back to the surface and discover the real purpose of this apparent tomb.The puzzles are mostly Myst-style logic puzzles on a big scale. To solve these puzzles the player has to search the tomb and perceive and understand the engravings of this old civilization. This knowledge is mostly used to put old machines into operation or deactivate deadly traps. The player quickly finds a notice book of another archaeologist who apparently already explored most of the complex. This serves as a subtle ingame help system - it doesn't give the solutions but hints to the nature of the puzzles.In 1997 it got a complete overhaul and was re-released as Entombed Enhanced.</desc>

		<desc>This collection is a set of four "retro games" based on fondly remembered titles from the 1980's. BOT Your mission is to prevent the Mother CPU from completing its military conquest of the planet. To succeed you'll need to pass through 5 levels of BOT soldiers shooting them at will, including a larger BOT boss at the end of every level. Try to pick up extra grenades, armor protection, and more powerful weaponry along the way to assist you in accomplishing this task. Finding the experimental lightning gun is especially helpful, since it inflicts twice as much damage on enemies as your normal gun.BUBBLE TROUBLE You control a spaceship which you must use to clear the starlanes of subspace vortices (which look like terrestrial water bubbles). You must avoid contact with these vortices and shots by your own weapons, or your energy will slowly drain away. Your ship is armed with two weapons: guns, which are weak but use up little energy, and penetrators, which are strong but use up much more energy. Ship energy is used for thrusting, subspace jumping, and conducting repairs. Shields are used for defense only, and you lose shield power when you come in contact with vortices, bullets, penetrators, saucers, or stationary energy barbs.FLAK ATTACK A horde of robot commandos are attacking your base from the skies above. You control a single gun which you must aim and fire to stop the invaders, but don't run out of ammunition, or your base will certainly be destroyed. When a robot parachutes to the ground, it will walk towards your base and stand beside it.  When 4 robots gather on one side of the base, they will destroy it, and the game will be over. The enemy ships include satellites, jets, and helicopters.  Satellites fly past at high speeds, but they cannot harm your base directly. Jets fly overhead quickly, and the pilot will eject if you fire enough shots at it. Helicopters drop parachuting robots as they pass. Friendly UN Helicopters will drop extra ammo on your base if you let them fly peacefully overhead. MOLE'S QUEST As Monty the Mole, you must rescue your belongings which the miners have scattered throughout the mines after they destroyed your beautiful home. Jump from platform to platform from the left to the right, grab the belonging, and jump back to the left to safely pass each level. Each time you save ten belongings, you will see an animation of Monty taking the rescued belongings to his new home. Since the mines are covered with radioactive ooze, you </desc>

The characters were based on the 1950s version of Felix with The Professor, Rock Bottom, Poindexter, Master Cylinder and Vavoom. These are cartoons that show the full extent of how the program functions with a finished product. One is semi-finished, as it is used by the manual as a tutorial to instruct the user on the use of the program. Once the mini-toons are viewed, the only thing left is to create your own cartoon. To accomplish this, many, many tools are given, along with quite a few scenery areas and props. Picture it as a movie studio, ala Roger Rabbit's Toon Town, on CD and you are the writer, director, producer and script writer. One is only limited by the imagination of the user. That is one of the strongest points that this program has going for it. Children should be creating as they learn, directing the action, determining what the next step should be.</desc>

		<desc>In Maze Madness, Freddi's friend Luther has managed to accidentally scatter Grandma Grouper's kelp seeds throughout a gigantic set of underwater mazes.  You control Freddi Fish, who sets out to find and recover all of the missing kelp seeds.   As she advances through 50 levels (plus bonus rounds), you'll need to solve simple puzzles, avoid pesky critters, and pick up special items which will help her on her way.  After all of the kelp seeds have been picked up in a maze, Freddi will automatically advance to the next round.The player controls Freddi by using the mouse or keyboard. The cursor keys move Freddi, while the Enter and Ctrl keys allow Freddi to fire when she has the Bubble-Shooter power-up.  If you choose to use the mouse, simply move the cursor arrow to a target location for Freddi, click the left mouse button, and she'll attempt to swim toward the target - Freddi will be able to navigate corners, but only one at a time, so if she's unable to swim to the target, try breaking the trip up into shorter pieces.   If Freddi has the Bubble-Shooter powerup, she'll fire bubbles if she is directly facing the target, and if the mouse button is held down briefly. The game allows multiple people to play the game with their progress recorded under their own name. The game allows you to save or exit the game after each level is finished, and previously finished levels can be re-played.The game also comes with a level editor, that is icon-based rather than text-based so non-readers can use it.</desc>

Luther's search will eventually take him through 100 underwater levels jam-packed full of action and adventure.  On the way home, Luther will need to be aware of the hazards around him, while picking up worm doodles which will allow him to advance further.  Bubbles, which are constantly rising from deep within the whirlpool, will force the water level down if they are allowed to reach the water's surface.  If the water level becomes too low, Luther will have to retry the level, minus one energy level.  To prevent this from happening, Luther must use his trusty slingshot and unlimited supply of ammo to pop the bubbles before they reach the surface.  Luther also needs to be careful when navigating the whirlpool, since running into a bubble may render him momentarily trapped and unable to fire his slingshot.</desc>

		<desc>First to say, Fructus based upon Columns.Before you start the game, you can choose in the options your starting level, the higher the level, the faster the fruits will fall. Furthermore you have the option to choose the number of fruits per row.Once you have started a game, you will be presented with your current falling row, which consists of three random fruits. Now it's your job to manipulate the order of the row, how the fruits are falling. Your final goal is to form up a row of the same type of fruits on the bottom of the game field, once you done this, these fruits will disappear, and the fruits that maybe on top of these, will fall further down.How many similar fruits you need for this depends on the option you have set before you started. On default it's three fruits, maximal is eight fruits (from eight possible squares). You do not need to arrange them horizontal, you can also arrange them vertical or diagonal. Once this row vanishes, you get your points. If you reach a certain amount of points, you proceed to the next level, were this all gets faster. All in all, there are 9 levels in total.The fruits you play with are the following: Cherry, Strawberry, Watermelon, Apple, Grapefruit, and Plum. In addition, there are some kind of red "stars", these are falling only in a row without fruits, once they hit the fruits, some of them gets destroyed and you earn points.And in addition to the fruit-based-column-game, there is a plain square-based-column-game included, which can be activated (or deactivated) from the options.</desc>

		<desc>Terrans have won the war for the Coalition, but at a terrible price. It has unleashed the powers of the Bions, warriors bred for battle and victory. After the war ended, Bions started their own war against Humanity... And humanity managed to win again, but Earth was decimated in the process. We thought we had destroyed all the Bions, but apparently we are wrong. A few Bions have survived... and they are rebuilding on the planet named Fury... As a councillor in Council of Peace, the premier peacekeeping force, you will take the advanced fighter and repel the Bion invasion, and eventually destroy the Bion threat once and for all. Fury│ is basically a Windows adaptation of Terminal Velocity where you pilot a super fighter and kill bazillion targets from first person (default) or third-person viewpoints. The action is fast and furious, with plenty of air and ground threats plus structures to shoot. The fighter sequences are interspersed with a bit of tunnel running (inspired by Descent, no doubt) and a lot of shooting. Shoot the weapon pods to release missiles and other goodies which you can use to supplement your own ship. The game is in full 3D without the need for a 3D video accelerator, though it only supports 320x200 resolution and preferably 256 color only.</desc>

By affecting environmental conditions (oxygen, pH, hydrogen levels) and changing the gene structure itself it's possible to observe the growth of a single cell into a complex organism. Each action evokes a response from an embryo, ranging from death to unusual mutations (i.e. a simple change in chromosome chain may develop insect-like eyes).

The player is a scientist who is circling the earth in a space laboratory. During the journey, a deadly virus hits earth and wipes out the entire human population in a few days. With no one left, it is the scientist's job to recreate life and control the conditions to let new embryos grow and evolve.

The game is bundled with an extensive summary on genetics including such subjects as DNA Replication, Mutation, Cell Division and Cell Cycle, etc.</desc>

Most people dismiss this situation since apparently it won't collide with us, however a group of scientists scramble to develop a way to stop this comet. Whether they want to destroy it, divert it, or whatever is unknown however, and you are charged with the task to find out what really is going on. The game is viewed from a first person perspective and progresses as an adventure game, where the emphasis is to explore and discover rather than solve puzzles (this seems to be the Japanese concept of an adventure game) so ultimately it is not so much of a game as it is more an interactive "tour de force".</desc>

		<desc>Gecko Shuffle is a simple game that tests one's reflexes. The player is presented with three tiles, two of which are empty and one of which has a gecko depicted on it. When the gecko is clicked, the three tiles are reversed and then re-arranged, the player then has to click on the tile which, in his opinion, is the one with the gecko. The tiles are then revealed again, and the player can see whether his guess was correct. A successful guess gives 10 points. The game can be played at one of the 10 levels - the higher the level, the faster the tiles move.There are two game modes: the "Single Level Shuffle", where the player chooses the level he wishes to play on, and has an opportunity to make 20 guesses (correct or not) before the game ends, and the "Progressive Level Shuffle", which is based on the same rules, but the level increases with each successful guess and decreases with each failure.After each guess, the player can see an instant replay of the tiles re-arranging, but in slow motion and with the tiles revealed.</desc>

		<desc>The idea of the game is to line up enough Gems of the same color in a row to earn a Drop.

Use the keyboard to rotate the Gems, and move them over so that the colors line up. They can line up horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. When they line up, they clear and the Gems above them fall in their place. Now those may clear too. You will see some incredible chain reactions if you place the Gems just right.

Each level has a different Threshold, which you can see at the top right of the screen. Each level also has a Not Threshold, which lets you know how many Gems to line up to earn a Not.

Nots let you use special effects. These help clear Gems that are on the board.

When you've earned enough Drops, you can advance to the next level. There are 100 levels in all.</desc>

By spending a day in the life of Charlie Brown, children can learn new words, practice spelling, create sentences and stories, read comics, and play games with the Peanuts kids. An intuitive user interface, coupled with top-notch music and animation, makes it fun to use. Its activities, like Hangman and the Spelling Bee, may seem like old standbys, but the title presents them with an entertaining, Peanuts-style twist. More important, they are challenging and effective at improving spelling and vocabulary. While no one will view the integrated dictionary as a substitute for a full-featured multimedia dictionary, its entries are all first vocabulary words and the program fosters its use. The game is recommended for ages 4 to 8. It has 3 levels of difficulty, and there's integrated into the program an illustrated, 1,000-word dictionary.</desc>

		<desc>In Grand Prix Manager, the goal is to build a successful Formula One racing team, and keep it there for 40 years. In the role of  manager, the player will have to make sure that they are employing the best personnel available in the market: including engineers, designers, mechanics, marketing staff and of course, the drivers, All this within the constraints of the team's budget. The marketing people are responsible for "wooing" potential sponsors to the team and to negotiate merchandising deals. The engineers, mechanics and designers, the unsung heroes of a Formula 1 team, have to divide their time between preparing the cars for race day and doing R&amp;D for new parts, driver aids and the next year's chassis.</desc>

		<desc>Take control of one of the existing Formula 1 teams (or one of two customizable fictitious ones) and try to take them to the top of the start in this management simulation.Every major decision is under your control. You must choose which parts of the car to improve, including Driver Aids whose legality varies over the years - is the extra performance worth the risk of disqualifications? Testing will help you assess the car's performance and prepare set-ups for the next race.Staff can be hired and fired, ranging form drivers to designers and commercial staff, which often means trading off having a large team, or a small but well-drilled and capable one. Obtaining and retaining the interest of sponsors and engine manufacturers is a crucial challenge as the years go on.Once the race weekend comes around, you must make the best use of practice and qualifying sessions, as well as preparing a pit strategy and being ready to adjust it if incidents, weather or unexpected performance issues occur. The action is viewed from overhead, with full commentary.There are also 5 Challenges, which set you a specific task based on one changed variable (such as bank balance, driver skill and engine supply).</desc>

		<desc>Come face to face with the terrible monsters and strange creatures of myth and legend: the Yeti, Minotaur, Loch Ness Monster, Cyclops, Leviathan, Pegasus, Golem, Unicorn, Gorgons, and Phoenix. The CD-ROM is supposed to be an authoritative look at the history and origins of these beasties. Includes: virtual 3D environments for each creature, 3D animation, video, narration, color illustration and original and historical documents. It begins in a castle with four doors, two of which are designed to take you to the sections on "Legendary Lands and Lost Cities" and "Legendary Heroes and Villains" available as further volumes in the series. When you get to the end of the corridor, you find yourself outside with several glowing gems embedded in the terrain. Clicking on one will take you to a section on one (or more) of the monsters. It takes a bit of stumbling around to discover which creature is tied to which gem. After you've gathered all your information about a creature, the game treats you to an animation of what it was supposed to look like. The music is appropriately ominous, the graphics are beautifully detailed (you'll need to know how to switch your monitor to at least 32,000 colors) and narrator Patrick Floersheim, dressed as a monk, is appropriately hammy.</desc>

		<desc>Green Thumb Cards is a virtual version of an actual card game.  Four players (up to 3 of which can be played by the computer) take cards featuring flowers, garden pests, helpful tools and random acts of nature.  Players try to obtain complete sets of flowers by taking cards from the stack, stealing cards from another player, or picking up cards out of the center walkways.  For example, it takes 4 roses to complete the rose set.  Once a player has successfully planted all cards of a set in their garden, they have earned the points for that set and can no longer lose those cards.  Other players can steal cards by using a pest card.  Pests can be defended against by using the appropriate defense card.  The player who has earned the most points when all cards have been used is the winner.  Game featured net play as well as offline play.</desc>

		<desc>Endorsed by pro golfer Greg Norman, this golf sim places you on the Medalist Golf Club stationed in Florida (which Norman himself helped to design), and Norman acts as your host in the course, giving fly-by narrations and insight on the course, as well as accompanying you on golfing rounds.Gameplay is standard golf fare, with the addition of two modes: arcade and simulation. On arcade mode you have the usual 3-stage power bar for your swing. While on simulation mode you just click whenever you want the ball to go and your golfer swings. The trick is on simulation mode: 40 editable statistics are taken into account for the accuracy, power, etc of the swing. So depending on how you have customized your golfer you'll have a good long-range game, but be weak in the wet, etc..Graphics consist of mostly digitized photo-realistic images.</desc>

		<desc>This was the first game release targeted specifically to girls. Its designer was Trina Roberts, a writer for Barbie Comics and designer of Wonder Woman. The game was not successful, probably due to the low budget accorded such a ground-breaking project. It was followed, however, by four or five other games targeted towards girls, and it did introduce some of the features that would dominate the girls' games movement discussed in this volume: more character-centered plots, issues of friendship and social relationships, and bright colorful graphics. The two protagonists are 14-year-old students of Hawaii High, one native, one just moved from New York. They meet and make friends, and the girl from New York learns all about Hawaii in the course of the adventure, which involves a stolen tiki that they find and that they try to bring back, and in the course of doing that they discover an ancient Hawaiian burial and have to deal with two thieves who are bad guys, but kind of wacky bad guys, and wind up on the slopes of a volcano, surrounded by flowing lava, and meet mysterious creatures like the ghostly kahuna who is guardian of the burial cave.</desc>

		<desc>Most reading programs make a classic mistake. They use traditional works of literature.

Now think about it for a minute. If the reading material isn't interesting, if it isn't relevant... to kids... how will they learn the difference between knowing what a sentence says and what it means?

That's the problem NFL Reading tackles.

Packed with passages featuring real pro football facts and stats, this game lets kids - playing against each other or the computer - pick their favorite NFL teams. They call a play, then read a passage.

How well they answer determines how well their team does in a 3D photo-realistic football game that gives reading skills a real workout.</desc>

		<desc>Hearts is a card game. At the end of the game, the player with the lowest score wins. Your goal in each hand is to avoid winning any 'tricks' including a heart or the Black Maria (aka the Queen of Spades), or to gain all 13 hearts and the Black Maria. Hearts for Windows allows for 1 to 4 human players but is always a 4 player game either filled by human players or computer players. The only drawback to more than one person playing is all the human players cards are displayed on one screen, allowing for each player to see each others cards. The program allows for custom rule variations such as the Jack of Diamonds are worth -10 points, etc... The computer players randomly say silly comments.</desc>

		<desc>High Command is a tactical strategy game. The game field, which looks a lot like Minesweeper, is divided into squares. Each square is either neutral, hostile or belongs to you. Some squares are cities which have a high point value. Your goal is to reach as much points as possible by conquer the enemy's squares and cities. Similar to the board game Risk you have to move soldiers from a bordering square into the hostile square to seize it. But there is a catch: Not only the number of your and the enemy's troops in a square affect the chances - the troops in the bordering squares have a strong influence of the combat outcome too.The game features three enemy AIs (aggressive, defensive and balanced), five historical and fictional scenarios. and an editor to build your own or random scenarios. The maximum number of war parties are 4, AI or human. In the shareware version you aren't allowed to save and there is only one scenario available.</desc>

The game offers all the excitement of a real poker game mixed with Sierra's unique brand of humour.The game offers a total of 20 variations on popular poker games including: Texas Hold 'Em, Omaha, Omaha Hi/Lo, High Chicago, Cincinnati, Baseball, 5 Card Stud, 7 Card Stud, 7 Card Stud Hi/Lo, Jacks or Better, Criss Cross, Dealers Choice, 5 Card Draw and 5 Card Draw Lo-ball.In single-player offline mode, you can select up to 7 opponents to play against, each with their own personality, playing style and skill level.  The animated AI characters are well done and if you study them carefully, you can figure out each player's tell, which gives away the fact that they have a good hand.  The Attitude Meter adjusts the speed of the game, setting it higher results in more animation and comments from the AI players, whereas setting it lower, keeps them quiet and offers a faster pace game.  You start with a bankroll of $1,000 in case with another $9,000 in your bank account which you can access via an ATM (it also has a personality of it's own).Once you've mastered the game (or become tired of the AI players),  check out the on-line play mode and see how your skills match up with real players from around the world.</desc>

A Card Flick game has been added, the object of which is to accurately toss as many cards into a hat as possible in the time allowed.Two versions can be installed on your computer at the same time. The Hoyle Solitaire HD (hard drive) game can be played without the CD in the drive, sacrificing only the music. Sound effects (shuffling and dealing cards) can be heard in either the Hard Drive or CD version. It plays in all versions of Windows released thus far, from Windows 3.x through Windows XP. Most of the gameplay is "drag and drop" but playing a card in some of the games simply requires a right click to send it to the correct spot. Easy and Difficult settings can be chosen per game and you can undo moves as often and as far back as you desire.Options allow you to replay the current game from the beginning, choose backgrounds, music and card decks. Up to 4 players can save their statistics separately.</desc>

A member of the Galactic Reconaissance Unit is sent to the moon Titan to examine if the recently found gas Rachellium could be the solution to earth's environmental problems. But of course he gets immediately involved in the resident's own problems.The player character is controlled with the mouse. When pressing a key on the keyboard the game opens a menu were the four main options can be chosen. The adventure part consists of logic puzzles like the assembling of a broken solar cell, finding and using inventory items and multiple-choice conversations. The second part of the game is the combat with the various life forms of Titan. Instead of a point &amp; click interface the player has to use a aiming panel on the upper right corner. By moving a crosshair inside this box the player aims his weapons in the actual game world. The weapons are fired with the already mentioned menu. During the game the player meets companions which help him during combat. They also receive their orders over the keyboard menu.</desc>

In this game, Addie the Kangaroo, Rufus the Dog, and Katie the Chameleon, help you while you are playing. Your job is to help Doctor Max Rigby, who has many sick animals in her animal park. Doctor Rigby takes you to a map in her ranch house, which shows you the four areas you can explore. There is the Savanna, the Farm, the Forest, and the Desert to explore. Once you enter an area, you can either find a sick animal or play a mini-game. Once you click on a sick animal, you go to the field hospital to check up on the animal. There are many tools to use, such as a x-ray, a scale, a thermometer, a microscope, and a stethoscope. Once you find what is wrong with the animal, you give it the correct treatment so it can heal. Once the animal heals, you will get a certificate and a letter from the animal showing that it is all better. The six mini-games are accessed in either the map or the Activity Center, including Weigh Cool, Ordering Life Cycles, Desert Treasures, Animal Crackers, Feeding Frenzy, and Animal Artistry.

		<desc>Indiana Jones is an archaeologist and adventurer, searching the globe for hidden treasures and lost artifacts. Towards this end, Indiana Jones has arrived in Mexico during the 1930s. Although the people living in the town of Lucasio are friendly, others such as Nazis, desperados and dangerous creatures are not so much. Indiana must use his skills to accomplish his objectives and retrieve treasured objects.Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures is an action/adventure game, seen in top-down view. Players control Indiana Jones as he collects items, attempts to solve all the puzzles and defeat his enemies in order to complete the mission. Indiana primarily uses his whip, but may also pick up a pistol or other weapons to use against foes. Indiana has a health meter on screen and will die if it drops to zero.The design of the game is meant to be casual gaming and is simplified to give the player quick experiences. Upon beginning a game, the player chooses the size of the game world (and indirectly the length of time it will take to complete). The game world, all the characters, items, and Indiana's mission are then randomly generated. Individual locations, such as the town of Lucasio may remain the same, however the path to and from those areas may change considerably.</desc>

The main challenge is that an automated security device is chasing you down, and must be avoided and ultimately destroyed. A delay between your commands and the robot's receipt of them forces you to pay close attention to the security drone and plan several steps ahead.As you explore the ship, you will find data ports, which can be jacked into to gain information or to open doorways. To access most of these, you will need to find and collect a DNA sample from a member of staff whose role gave him/her access.</desc>

You'll learn about the history and principles of robotics, and hear and see Asimov himself discuss the field. The Robotoid Assembly Toolkit (created by Ralph McQuarrie, the production designer for Star Wars) lets you build, animate, and save or print images of the virtual robots you construct. You can also see film clips of famous and not-so-famous movie robots or read from the sizable collection of Asimov's short stories and essays. His "Three Laws of Robotics" are discussed in detail, as are their impact on literature and actual science.

Without a doubt, The Ultimate Robot lives up to its name. This is a must for any Asimov fan.</desc>

Most of them can be played in two difficulty levels (Easy or Hard), and the Oracle provides clues to help along the way.The graphics for the puzzles are designed in an Egyptian or Mesopotamian style. Music plays in the background to provide atmosphere, but it can be turned off, if it gets repetitive. The basic layout is a hexagon around an Oracle's well. There are three doors on the outside of the hexagon, and the first one is where you begin the game. In each room is a puzzle you have to solve to get a jewel which must be taken back to the Oracle's well.The puzzles in this game can be compared to those found in The 7th Guest.  The Chinese Checkers puzzle in Shivers rivals many of the ones contained in Jewels of the Oracle.</desc>

		<desc>Borrowing certain gameplay conventions from Qix, JezzBall presents another scenario forcing the player to divide and conquer a 2D playfield by whittling away slivers of it until it is at only 25% (or less) of its original size.The complicating factor here are balls, more with every level, bouncing off the edges of the continuous playfield and, incidentally, quite lethal to the player's marker, only tangible while in the act of diminishing the playfield by marking off areas no longer to be used.  The player can choose to trim horizontal or vertical segments -- depending on which axis they expect the bouncing ball to intercept soonest -- and the boring apparatus used fires off in opposite directions simultaneously, meaning the cross-section generally starts being cut from the middle and works its way toward the outside edges... all while keeping an eye on how close those balls are bouncing.The apparatus is slow, and until the entire cross-section is completed, its entire span is at risk of being hit.  The two sides of the dividing sweep are independent from each other, so if one side is intercepted by a ball while in the process of trimming, the other side continues unabated, resulting in a half-complete division.This game became famous after being distributed as part of the Microsoft Entertainment Pack 4 of Windows 3.x games, returning in the Best of Microsoft Entertainment Pack.</desc>

		<desc>Johnny Mnemonic is based on William Gibson's short story and a subsequent movie of the same name. The game's plot bears more similarities to the movie than to the original story. Johnny is a courier in a futuristic society, delivering data implanted in his brain. However, the latest delivery is so big that it can kill him if he doesn't download the data. Unfortunately, the only person who knew the password is dead, and members of the Yakuza are hunting for the data and for its living container.The game consists of live-action video footage and interactive sequences, some of which play like adventure game segments and may contain simple puzzles, while others are more action-oriented. Johnny's bodyguard Jane often handles the fighting episodes, the player can assign buttons to punches and kicks. The adventure parts contain limited exploration and interaction with the environment, and mostly serve to advance the plot.</desc>

		<desc>Cover-Up at Roswell is an adventure game based on the Jonny Quest animated television series. Over 50 minutes of footage of the show from various episodes was used to construct a new story as a game, along with a number of new sequences. The story details the Roswell incident where an alien UFO crashes into the earth. General Tyler and his Men in Black immediately salvage the wreckage, but a number of alien components has been scattered around the globe. Players guide the Quest team, consisting of Jonny, Jessie and Hadji, to keep the components out of the hands of Tyler and the genius Jeremiah Surd.The characters are guided through different scenes all around the world. They can be moved around, choose an item, grab it or hold it. The five alien objects need to be found using a tracking device that pin-points the location on a GPS. This takes the team to the Devil's Triangle, New York, Peru, Tanzania and Utah. Next to the main gameplay and cut-scenes, there is a large number of mini-games such as matching sequences, board games, rafting, shooting rats with a slingshot, jeep driving, fire extinguishing, and many more.Certain segments of the game were designed in 3D and Chromatek plastic viewing glasses were provided with the game to view these.</desc>

		<desc>Jump Raven is the second title released by Cyberflix. The game is set in New York in an undefined period in the 21st century. All wildlife appears to be extinct as man has scorched the entire earth with war. Before it was too late, all animals' genetic code has been stored in biodiversity pods to bring them back safely when the ecosystem has recovered. However, a gang steals the pods and the Environmental Security Agency (ESA) brings in bounty hunter Raven to return them and preserve the animals' future.Building on the technology of Lunicus, in Jump Raven the character Raven uses a hovercraft to move around the city. The game starts in a command center where the player can read up on the events that led to the global disaster, outfit the vehicle with different types of weapons, and interview candidates for the position of co-pilot in the hovercraft (Nikki, Chablis, Limbaugh, Thrash, Lark or Dogstar). Their in-game comments bring a different atmosphere to the gameplay.While flying, there are three boroughs to search for pods: The Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan. The hovercraft can be moved around, it can switch between a hover and a fly mode, and players need to aim and fire weapons. As that is too much for the player to handle, tasks can be delegated to the AI co-pilot. When the pods have been found, a boss character guarding the exit needs to be taken out.While playing, the game area takes up only half of the screen. The rest is reserved for incoming video messages (including taunting opponents), general options, weapon selection, a radar, a compass, and basic statistics about ammo, fuel, shields, the pods and cash. While searching the cities, targets such as jets, sleds, helicopters, tanks and armoured cars need to be engaged. When low on fuel, shield power or weapons, the fuel truck, weapons lady (in a helicopter) and the repair bay can be visited.</desc>

		<desc>Where Prince Interactive takes hours to finish and attempts to offer a career overview, Bowie's CD-ROM skips the ch-ch-changes and rehashes videos and songs from his 1993 Black Tie White Noise album. After the opening credits, you enter an elevator and walk down the corridors of a gray office building matching the set for the music video "Jump They Say". You are given a choice of entering three rooms: the David Bowie suite, the video suite or Room 2901. Inside the David Bowie suite is an office with desk, filing cabinet and chair. By clicking a camera sitting on the desk, you hear a 10-minute audio interview with shallow off-the-cuff commentary from Bowie, illustrated with photographs from a recording session. Clicking a briefcase on the floor launches an equally unsatisfying 10-minute video interview. Room 2901 contains a telescope. Looking through the telescope, you enter rooms in a hotel across the street to watch four music videos: "Jump They Say," "Black Tie, White Noise," "Miracle Goodnight" and "You've Been Around." The videos play in a window filling an eighth of the screen and look almost as good as MTV. Inexplicably, the hotel rooms contain little hidden surprises that seem to have wandered onto the disk from some children's game - click on a dog, for example, and it barks, click on a bowling trophy, and a bowling ball rolls across the floor. The video suite puts you at the controls of a video-editing machine where you create a customized version of "Jump They Say." The creativity is strictly limited, however, to selecting from five video tracks playing simultaneously, designating one to display on the main screen.</desc>

On each map screen, although the activities remain basically the same the difficulty level is increased, for example, instead of finding the voice for one instrument you will have two, the number of beats you have to follow in a rhythm game will increase, as will the number of sour notes to find in a piece of music. Once you have collected all the sour notes in an area it glows red on the map, so you know how much you've done. In addition, clicking on the music note on the bottom right of the screen brings up the options, where you can click on Hopsalot's bag to see how many sour notes have been collected.When all the sour notes are collected and brought to the Concert Hall to be sweetened, Hopsalot presents you with a Sweet Note award that can be printed.</desc>

		<desc>On a beautiful sunny day, King Graham of Daventry decides to take a stroll in the woods surrounding his castle.  When he returns, he discovers with horror that his home, Daventry Castle, has completely disappeared!  Graham is at a loss, and wonders how this could have happened, when a talking owl named Cedric appears.  He tells him that he saw the whole thing, and that an evil wizard named Mordack whisked the entire castle away, along with Graham's family in it.  Cedric offers to take him to his homeland, Serenia, where his master, the wizard Crispin resides.  Surely Crispin will be able to help King Graham rescue his family from Mordack's clutches.King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder is an adventure game, and the first from Sierra to use a point-and-click mouse interface.  Rather than typing commands on a keyboard to interact with the game world and use the arrow keys to walk around, King's Quest V instead simplifies all actions down to base commands.  To access the different cursors, the player can move the mouse to the top of the screen, revealing a hidden menu with each of the different actions, as well as game options and the inventory bag.  By clicking the "Walk" cursor on the screen, Graham will walk as close as he can to the appropriate area.  Clicking the "Eye" cursor on items will provide a description, the same as typing "Look at".  The "Hand" cursor is a multipurpose cursor that can be used to push, pull, interact with and pick up objects.  The "Head" cursor is used to talk to people (and in the strange world of King's Quest, often objects and animals, too).  Players can also right-click to cycle through the different available cursors.  Inventory that Graham picks up now gets placed into a bag.  By clicking on the bag, this opens up a sub-window that displays all the inventory that Graham currently has.  In here, players can look at or interact with objects, combine them with other objects, or pick them up to use them in the game environment as another cursor.As with most Sierra games, it is quite possible to die.  Bumping into witches, poisonous scorpions, falling off edges of cliffs, dying of thirst in the desert, and many other objects, locations and characters will send Graham to an untimely demise.  The player must be cautious as they explore Serenia - frequent game saving across multiple files is usually the best course of action to make sure that you don't get stuck or have to start right from the game's very beginning.</desc>

		<desc>For months Prince Alexander of Daventry has shut himself away from the world, thinking only of Princess Cassima, who he met while imprisoned in the previous game. Eventually he can take it no longer, and he hires a ship to search for the Land of the Green Isles located on the edge of the world. After months of searching he finally sets sight upon the island kingdom, only for a freak storm to strike the ship, destroying it and leaving him the only survivor. His troubles are far from over, however, as he soon finds out that the King and Queen have passed away, the Greens Isles are on the brink of war, and his beloved Princess Cassima may even be held prisoner by the royal vizier.Like its predecessors in the series, King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure game. For Alexander to save the Isles, he must travel between the Land's four magical islands, each based on myth and fables, and encounter people and strange beasts that will either help or hinder him. Alexander must be careful as well, because, as with all the King's Quest games, poor choices or missteps will often prove fatal for the Prince. Puzzles are solved linearly, although late in the game there are two completely different paths to take to reach the final confrontation. Like the previous game, actions are performed using a point-and-click interface with icons that represent verbs ("walk", "examine", "use", "talk", etc.). The CD-ROM version of the game includes both DOS and Windows versions, full speech, a pre-rendered introduction, and the Girl in the Tower theme song.</desc>

		<desc>Kye is a classic "collect the diamonds" game named after the author's dog. Kye must be navigated through some difficult levels, eating or pushing blocks out of his way, and figuring out obstacles and traps. There are balls that move in one direction, sticky blocks that can pull obstacles out of the way, and five kinds of monsters that pursue Kye in real-time. Besides the monsters, some levels have blocks that are constantly in motion, so reflexes and skill are required in addition to problem solving. There is no gravity and no boulders to drop, and the levels, blocks and monsters are entirely original, so this isn't just another Boulder Dash clone. You can design your own custom levels, and a number of third-party level packs exist. Version 2.0 added five extra levels, black holes, one way doors, time bombs, an on-screen level editor, and registration now required a charitable donation to Save the Children, instead of direct payment to the author. There are 15 levels in the shareware version, and originally there were 20 extra levels in the registered version. User-created levels were added over the years, with a final tally of 496 extra levels in the registered version.</desc>

		<desc>A shareware Shanghai-like solitaire game system that uses Mah-Jongg tiles.  Contains a number of unique or non-standard games.  Created and programmed by a fan of Mah-Jongg solitaire.The games are presided over by manga-style girls, who react to the gameplay, let you know you're in the high score board, etc.  High score lists are maintained for all games, all skill levels.  The game is fully customizable- backgrounds, tilesets, and music can be changed (and new selections are available for download through the official site.)  Dragon layout can also be changed, for variety greater than the traditional game provides.Game variations: Solitaire: the standard, famous game, with the standard, famous "dragon" (layout).  Click tile pairs to remove them, if the tiles are free to move to the side.Rivers: same tiles, square layout, new rules, tile pairs must be free to move from side or top, and there can be no more than two 90 degree "turns" to bring the two tiles together.  Players of the old/rare arcade game "Sports Match" will understand the mechanics.Memory: same tiles, square layout, tiles need not be "free", but since they're all turned over, you must remember where partner tiles are located.Clicks: new tiles (color-based rather than MahJongg based).  Based on a freeware game, "Clickomania" (and Sega Swirl is suspiciously similar to it, too.)  Tiles of different colors can be removed if there are more than one of the same color connected.  Gravity affects remaining tiles, which create a dynamic, moving playfield.  Remove as many as possible, and leave as few tiles remaining as possible.Slider: same tiles as Clicks.  Slide tiles around to form 5-tile lines (and remove them).  Each move adds 3 new tiles to the board.Hashira: same tiles as Clicks.  Falling 3-tile sets must be combined to remove combinations of same-colored tiles.  Incredibly similar to Columns.The early versions of Kyodai are suitable for Windows 3.1+.  Middle versions are suitable for Windows 95+, and are in 2D.  The latest versions are in 3D, and use DirectX technology.  (OpenGL versions are also available.)</desc>

		<desc>Kids like to read books- and they love to watch movies (Note: eXo does not necessarily agree with this statement). That's why Sound Source created the Interactive MovieBook Series. Based on current silver screen versions of classic children's tales, they combine text, animation, licensed, full-motion color film clips and 3-D sound effects.

Adams and Carwardine traveled to various locations in the hope of encountering species on the brink of extinction. The book, radio documentary and this software title are the result of their travels which is illuminating to say the least. This software title featurins 800 still photographs, Douglas Adams providing a reading of the nearly complete book, Carwardine reading fact files on the species they searched like side bars, extracts from the BBC Radio 4 series and menus for creating custom collections of data and images</desc>

		<desc>Shape Up or Slip Out! is the fifth game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series. All the events from the previous games are forgotten. Larry is once again single, and again his goal is to capture the interest of various ladies. By sheer coincidence, Larry finds himself on a TV Game Show called "Stallions". He wins a weekend at the Spa Resort, La Costa Lotta. Naturally, there are some beautiful women in the spa who are just dreaming about such a wonderful, handsome man as Larry! Uh... or is it really so? It is the player's goal to find out!This instalment focuses more on conversations with women and puzzles than on the storyline. The entire game is spent at La Costa Lotta. There are plenty of traditional inventory-based puzzles to solve in the game. Larry can die, but the player is allowed to try again every time that happens, without the need to restore a saved game. This is also the first Larry game with SVGA graphics, and voice-overs in the CD version.</desc>

In addition, the game has 5 Time To Play mini-games. The Coloring Book has 15 different pictures to color and print out. Trivia contains 100 airport-related questions with answers within the game - for pre-readers, Buzzy will read the question out loud and also provide hints. There are 3 difficulty levels for this game. In Lost Luggage, you work your way through 99 levels of conveyor belt puzzle madness, trying to get all the moving luggage to their proper destination. True detectives will like the Find It game, where the game picks 10 items within the game and you go find them. This game has 3 difficulty levels. Finally, there's What Is It? This is a picture/word matching game, with three difficulty levels and 33 pictures per level - all from the airport environment.</desc>

		<desc>This game allows children to explore Humongous versions of the South American, African and Southeast Asian jungles, and learn about some of the animal and plant life there. Like "The Airport" and "The Farm" titles, this game features Buzzy the Knowledge Bug as a guide. He reads aloud questions, answers, and the names of objects. In addition, he provides tips and suggestions and points out interesting facts. Kids can explore the three environments, each of which has quite a few locations, where they can click on things for fun animations or instead ask "What Is This?" and go to a micro-encyclopedia for each item which describes the item and shows where they are from. The 210-item encyclopedia also has an index, so kids can jump right to items - clicking on the picture on the page will take you a place where that bug, bird, plant, or animal can be found. The encyclopedia has text, but will also read to the child if they wish - you can have it read each word by just holding the cursor over the word too. The pages also have colored hyper-linked words that are topics of other pages in the encyclopedia.The game also has 5 mini-games, such as Trivia or Find It (shown game-related images and then have to go find them), or a 15-page coloring book (which can be printed out and has mixable colors) and Jungle Jumble (spelling/unscramble game). The Anteater Feeder mini-game is just for fun, an 100-level arcade version of the old carnival shooting game except the weapon is an anteater's tongue and you eat bugs. These games have difficulty settings, to make things harder or easier.</desc>

The objective of the game is to turn off all the lit buttons in as few moves as possible. Buttons are changed by clicking on them but all adjacent buttons are then also changed. Making a change creates an effect pattern and the game can be played with two different patterns: cross or diagonal. According to the box cover the game consists of over 24 billion puzzles and these are divided into nine different puzzle types. There are four different grid sizes: 5x5, 6x6, 7x7 and 8x8. It's possible to play with pre-programmed puzzles or randomized ones.</desc>

		<desc>Literati is a version of a 1990 DOS shareware game that was converted and upgraded with more features for Windows in 1994 for MVP Software.  In 2000, it became a popular part of the Yahoo Games web portal playable in a JAVA format in a web browser.  Similar to Scrabble, the gameplay involves placing letters from 7 tiles per player on a board and trying to accumulate the highest score possible.  Letters are distributed to players randomly and are worth between 1 and 5 points while blank tiles (one which is always given in first 7 tiles of the game) have no point value but can be made into any letter.  The first word must be placed horizontally or vertically with one tile on the center square.  Subsequent words must use one letter of an existing word or be placed next to one so that any touching letters form valid words also.  Knowing the valid 2-letter words is very helpful in doing this.  Placing tiles on letter and word multiplier squares will increase your score and if you place all 7 tiles on the board at once, a 35-point bonus is given.  A player can also choose to pass and select any of the letters in their pile to trade for new ones but loses their turn.At player first creates a table and can change its options for number of players, put a time limit and whether it is unrated or rated (the outcome will affect a person's overall rating).  A challenge mode can also be set so that any word placed on the board can be challenged as to its validity by an opponent.  If it is invalid the word is removed and the player who put it down loses their turn or else the challenger loses their next turn if the word is indeed valid.  Other players choose to Join a table and press Start to begin a game.When all tiles in the game are distributed and one player places all their remaining ones on the board or no-one can play any more tiles then the game is over.  The sum of the letter values in each player's hand is subtracted from their score. If a player has no letters remaining, the sum of all of the letter values in the other players' hands are added to their score. The person with the highest score wins.</desc>

Another big difference to other football games is that you don't watch polygon players - all possible moves and outcomes were filmed with real football players. You don't have access to detailed player statistics nor a full season - you are restricted to playing exhibition games.</desc>

		<desc>In 1893, an English archaeologist called Sir Evangel finds a strange stone in a London antiquary. The galopetra ("milk stone") has a hieroglyphic and a maze carved on one side, and a Minotaur on the reverse. Intrigued, he travels to Crete and starts to explore the newly discovered Knossos ruins. Searching the labyrinth, he stumbles upon a time machine, dubbing it the "Loony Machine". He leaves instructions at the site on how the device works, for future explorers willing to travel to 2000 years in the past and assume the role of Theseus, the slayer of the Minotaur.

Loony Labyrinth is the 4th pinball simulator created by LittleWing. It has one table with classic proto-Greek mythological themes. As an explorer and later as the legendary hero Theseus, the objective is to first find and activate the time machine, and then go back to ancient times and defeat the Minotaur.

In the first part, the goal is to collect all the five galopetra stones and install them to activate the machine. The ball has to hit drop targets near the stone ramp to make one of the STONE light letters start flashing. One stone is collected by sending the ball up the ramp while the light is blinking. Getting all the stones awards five million points. To install them, the ball has to hit several times the energy charger bumper, raising the energy level to 100% and turning on the install hole.

After traveling to 2000 B.C., the music changes and a multiball starts to indicate the switch. The goal is to rescue nine human sacrifices and kill the Minotaur. The LOONY LABYRINTH lights at the center of the table turn on to show the number of hostages, turning off with every saved victim. Shooting the labyrinth ramp rescues them one at time. After everyone is safe, a multiball starts where the player must sink three balls in the Minotaur chamber before the moon phase indicators near the flippers turn off, to defeat the creature and win the game.</desc>

		<video>./snap/Louis Cat Orze - The Mystery Of The Queen's Necklace (1995).mp4</video>
		<desc>This is a CD-ROM history lesson cleverly designed as a mystery. The Queen's necklace has been stolen, and you, the trusty investigator, have a short six days to track down the thief. The Royal Palace at Versailles is the scene of the crime. Aided by the mischievous Louis Cat Orze, a feline of royal descent if there ever was one, you must explore the palace and the surrounding countryside, listen in on conversations, and occasionally pick a pocket. Louis Cat Orze isn't a free ride, though-fees must be paid, palms greased, and while you begin the game with a certain amount of livres, you have to investigate thoroughly and learn about the era in order to earn more. Or you can try your hand at the Palace Games to increase (or decrease) your purse. Once you think you know the identity of the thief, you can present your accusation to the king - if you can afford to see him, and if you haven't been thrown into the Bastille! It has its share of pitfalls, some of these you learn by doing, and some are buried in the manual (read it completely). You'll need to listen carefully to understand what's going on, for what people say can lead you in different directions - some are plausible dead ends, but some will be of real value. Learning about the 17th century is the only way you'll win. The drawings are somewhat cartoonish and the animation is minimal. Secret passages, exchanges of money in the Orangerie, the clink of gold coins in the Grand Apartment and gossip in the Hall of Mirrors all play an important part in this riveting mystery. You only have six days to solve the mystery. The game includes 75 biographies of people who lived during this period. A mesmerizing soundtrack is performed by a full chamber orchestra.</desc>

		<desc>Lunacy for Windows is a single-player, shareware, puzzle game. The game is reminiscent of Pipe Mania! in that the player has to guide a spark along electrical wires from a start point to an end point. However In this game the player does not add new pieces of wiring to the puzzle, instead the wiring is already in place and the player rotates it at the node points to make new connections or to break others.

Additionally there are special nodes, some of which speed up the spark, some which cause it to burn the wires it passes through so they cannot be re-used and some fixed nodes that cannot be rotated at all.

All puzzles are timed. The game has a high score table which holds the ten best scores. The game is played entirely via the mouse.</desc>

		<desc>One of the best CD-ROMs ever made and the best software ever made about Shakespeare's works, Voyager's Macbeth is a masterpiece in literary CD-ROM. The CD not only includes the fully indexed and searchable text of Shakespeare's famous tragedy (based on the recently published Cambridge edition, edited by one of the CD-ROM's co-authors, Professor A. R. Braunmuller), but more importantly the *complete audio performance* of the entire play by the Royal Shakespeare Company, directed by Trevor Nunn, which stars Ian McKellan as Macbeth, and Judi Dench as Lady Macbeth. Definitely one of the best renditions of the play ever performed. In terms of user interface, Voyager outdid themselves with Macbeth. Not only can you jump to any page or word, but you can also click on any line of the play to go directly to that place in the RSC's audio performance and hear it read out loud. There are numerous notes, anecdotes, and glossary items (over 1,500 of them), all of which are hyperlinked and indexed, and 25,000-word worth of extensive essays that analyze the play in detail. And if that's not enough, you can view video clips from other performances of key scenes, from Macbeth movies directed by Akira Kurosawa, Orson Welles, and Roman Polanski. To top it all off, there's plenty of maps, charts, and images to make this the definitive CD-ROM about the play. As always, you can copy any text from the CD-ROM to paste it into a word processor of your choice. Macbeth is without a doubt another high quality title from Voyager, one that successfully marries the scholarly expertise of the authors -- in this case Drs. Rodes and Braunmuller, two Shakespearian scholars -- with Voyager's technical and design expertise in creating attractive CD-ROMs. If you have even a slight interest in Shakespeare, this wonderful CD-ROM is a must-have.</desc>

Madeline and various kids journey through Paris in the neighborhood of her boarding school with different learning activities presented as mini-games and collecting items such as curtains, a cape, a chain, bread, gumballs, a balloon and puppets for the show along the way.</desc>

		<desc>Billed as "the world's first interactive multimedia novel," this brilliantly fulfills the latter half of its claim (i.e. “multimedia novel”) while dismally failing the first (i.e. “interactive”). It's an art film whose commercial value arises from the novelty of the medium. Based on the legend of the Paladin Roland, a knight in the service of Charlemagne, the tale of Madness of Roland is told from multiple points of view which you can select at will. Each character tells their own, often contradictory, version of the story. Roland uses text, digital color paintings, animation, QuickTime video, professional "radio theatre" narration, hypertextual links and a complete original soundtrack to transport you to the world of Charlemagne's France.</desc>

Then, about a week later, a lifeboat with survivors was discovered out near the Pleiades but the captain and a couple of other people were still missing. The search went on but turned up nothing and eventually it was abandoned. Some time later a feint signal was detected. It was thought that this could be the Majestic's beacon but it was so very faint that no-one was sure. So a field archaeologist was dispatched to investigate.Majestic Part 1: Alien Encounter is a science fiction point-and-click adventure game. The player takes on the role of the aforementioned archaeologist who locates the Majestic and explores the ship to discover what happened. Unlike traditional point-and-click adventures, however, the player explores the ship by sending up to four probes into the vessel. Each probe can link to systems, scan, cut holes in things with a torch, and pick up objects for examination. As the game progresses the probes can be upgraded to give them additional capabilities. They are controlled via an interface that displays the probe's view in a window the center of the screen. The same interface is used to save and restore the game. The game is entirely mouse-controlled and has a point system which measures the player's progress through the game.</desc>

		<desc>Adapted from the venerable British quiz show, Mastermind allows you to become a contestant on that program, competing against up to three others. You face two rounds of questions, the first round will see you answering a set of questions based on specialized field of your choice, while in the second round you must answer a set of general knowledge questions. Both rounds have a time limit of 2 minutes. Any question may be passed (skipped), so that you may answer more questions in the allotted time.The person who gets the most questions right wins the contest. If a tie occurs, the person with the most passes is the loser in the contest. If a tie occurs between two players with an equal number of passes, the contestants must answer a set of five questions - all five questions being the same between contestants - as a tie breaker.The host of the Mastermind game is (the now-late) Magnus Magnusson, who also hosted the real life Mastermind program for its entire first run from 1972 to 1997. If you run out of time in a round while he is posing a question to you, he'll state MastermindsÆ "I've started so I'll finish," catchphrase that he coined during the course of the program, finishing up the question and allowing you to answer it.Mastermind sports over 5,000 questions to answer, and has 50 groups of specialized questions.</desc>

Ultimately, you'll leave the house, but you'll take with you a greater appreciation for the world of art. More than 40 unique puzzles and games create a fresh approach to art. It has over 150 famous works of art by 46 artists such as Botticelli, Michaelangelo, Degas, Kahlo, Rembrandt, VanGogh and Calder. Lavish 3-D rendered rooms are covered in artwork from five major periods: Ancient Greek/Roman, Renaissance, Dutch Realism, Impressionism and 20th Century. There's a rich Musical score which showcases music from each period, and the content is researched and developed by art educators.</desc>

		<desc>Blasternaut, Galactic Commander, and Spot, are out searching space for The Lost City in their violet magenta cruiser. Galactic Commander feels this mission so important that she has left her normal duties at the base and joined the crew. Blasternaut and spot, however, are less than thrilled with the seemingly fruitless search.

Suddenly, Doctor Minus, a deep voiced robot with an obsession for subtraction, is behind them and shoots their ship down onto a barren planet where to their, if not the player's, surprise they find The Lost City. Despite this happy coincidence Doctor Minus is preparing an bombardment force and sending his "negatron" minions to the planet to make sure the Blaster crew doesn't get away. Galactic Commander knows more than she is letting on and is convinced that if they can restore power to buildings of the city they'll have an edge...</desc>

		<desc>This game, like its companion Strategy Heads, uses the colorful, fast-paced, irony-laden look and sound of MTV to teach math problem-solving strategies. You can design a surrogate character for yourself from a menu of heads, bodies and accessories. To play the game, choose from a menu of seven TV stations using a remote control icon. Three of the stations feature math games. Go Mental is a math quiz show in which the player must evaluate the reasoning and accuracy of solutions given by other characters in response to word problems. Dance 'Til You Drop asks you to estimate the answer to a series of number problems by sliding a platform (on which you are standing) along a number line so that its width spans a number range which includes the correct answer. The platform shrinks with time requiring greater precision in estimation. The game ends when the platform vanishes and you fall. In Face the Music you try to beat the clock, matching percentages to equivalent fractions and pictures. As a reward you get to design a music video. Other stations feature infomercials, demonstrations of shortcut solutions to multiplication and division problems, and a shopping channel where players can purchase math games, among other items, with their accrued score credit.</desc>

Within each game, there are four math difficulty levels for the user (or parent or teacher) to choose from. If the user correctly answers all of the problems in a game set, he gets a ticket that he can apply toward the purchase of a toy at the prize center. ôThe set up of this title is excellent. The prize tickets are great incentive for kids to finish a game,ö commented a parent reviewer.The games are fun for young children, and exercise a variety of beginning math skills. In the Calliope Counting Game, the user makes music on a pipe organ by counting out notes, either an original tune or a tune that the Rabbit leads. The Tightrope Show involves matching a number or equation that the rabbit holds up to a given number. In the Sea Lion Show, the user must uncover a number pattern by solving addition and subtraction problems. The Balloon Matching Game is a variation of the classic "concentration" game. Behind each balloon is a number, an equation, or a certain number of objects. The user must match the numbers with the correct number of objects or with the equation solutions.</desc>

		<desc>Disney's Donald Duck takes the starring role in this sidescrolling platform game.  As the detective Maui Mallard, he's on the trail of a long lost Idol, which has recently vanished.  Early on, Maui can also switch between his normal self and Ninja Maui, and with all the creepy voodoo enemies he'll encounter throughout his adventure, he's going to need all the help he can get.As previously mentioned, there are two personalities to Maui, and as a result, two different sets of controls.  Normal Maui carries a bug gun, which can fire a variety of different insect ammo, from basic bugs, to the more powerful lightning and fire bugs.  It's also possible for Maui to combine bugs to pack a more powerful blast at his enemies.Once Maui starts to find Yin-Yang coins, he'll be able to transform into Ninja Maui.  Ninja Maui has lightning-quick reflexes, and wields a bo staff.  In addition to being handy for whacking enemies, Ninja Maui can also climb between walls by jumping and propping the staff between the walls at the height of his jump.  He can also hook onto duck heads and swing from them to reach areas he normally couldn't.  You'll need to constantly find Yin-Yang coins to fuel your Ninja persona, otherwise you'll run out and transform back to Maui Mallard.The level layout in the Game Boy version is slightly different with less secrets to be found.</desc>

		<desc>The Antimatter Cold War has left Earth ruined as the stockpiled AM weapons of various nations were triggered in a chain effect, vaporizing large portions of the Earth. The once great continents have been drastically changed into thousands of tiny islands and various cities have washed into the oceans. During this turmoil, Zorgeuf the Great rushes to conquer the bewildered world along with a troop of commanders and declares the Earth Empire. The only hope to defeat him lies from without Earth, as the Colonial Forces send a command carrier from the major orbital base. With so many armies gone, the ground infantry unit has been replaced by the Metal Marine, a fifty foot armored robot that can be sent into battle for attack or defense. From their respective Command Center, each side in the conflict will need to direct the placement of facilities on the ground to defend against enemy attack, manage resources and successfully strike the enemy.

Metal Marines is an isometric strategy game. Controlling one side of a conflict, the player must wage a campaign across several islands to defeat Zorgeuf and his lieutenants. The player controls logistics of the base to ensure that there are the necessary assets to wage war. On each map, the player places three underground command bases, if all of these are destroyed the battle is lost. The player must manage the resources of their money to construct new buildings or upgrade existing facilities on the map. Different buildings include Energy Plants, Factories, Economic Centers, Radar systems, Anti-Aircraft missiles, fake buildings and fake HQ bases, mine fields, gun pods, missile launchers, metal marine hangers and even ICBMs. At any time, the player may order an attack and choose which assets to fire at the opponent. Missiles, Metal Marines carriers and ICBMs all use different levels of fuel. Metal Marines once deployed in an area will automatically fire rifles at nearby targets or engage even closer targets in melee attacks. Gunpods, while stationary, will also fire on nearby enemies. Metal Marines are largely autonomous but can be manually controlled to a minor degree (directional) by the player.</desc>

A variety of landscape and over 20 detailed command scenarios will give you plenty of landscape to rage with war.</desc>

The software was mainly a database of films, in a similar fashion to the Internet Movie Database, and gave descriptions of the films and who starred in them. Most of this information was not readily accessible before broadband internet. Cinemania contained professional material by Leonard Maltin, Roger Ebert, Pauline Kael, Baseline, James Monaco and Ephraim Katz. The program also included over 2000 still images for movies and actors, a large amount of sound clips, dialogs and soundtracks, and a smaller selection of full-motion video clips. As the amount of material increased with each new edition, the quality of media tended to decrease, in order to fit everything on a single CD-ROM.</desc>

Or they can trigger a brief animation to see some of histories greatest thinkers. For those needing help with reading (or just desiring the reassurance of another voice), narration by children can be turned on or off for all of the text that appears on the screen. With the signposts and the pop-up “see also” list, young minds can smoothly move from one fascinating – and educating – topic to the next, taking whatever path they desire. Along the way they will be increasing their knowledge of people and rediscovering the fun of reading. And they will also be acquiring the concepts of research and cross-referencing of subjects. Along the way they will learn how one part of social studies is related to the whole of world and its history.</desc>

		<desc>This is the first of two published interactive multimedia CD-ROM based collaborations between writer and director Jeff Green and the Animatics Multimedia Corporation. Noted for its cinéma vérité style, it is a Point Of View (POV) video-based experiment in simulated socializing that takes place in an anonymous city late one night. Players navigate between several locations, and can interact with one or more people in each location to varying effects based on the player's “reactions” to that person. The main technical innovation of Midnight Stranger is its use of an emotional continuum Mood Bar for interaction with the in-story characters rather than a text interface or an itemized set of options for each interaction. The Mood Bar simulates some of the frustration and uncertainty when dealing with other people in social situations, and provides a more realistic role playing experience.</desc>

		<desc>Millie's Math House is the first game in Edmark's early line-up of educational games designed for very young children to use. The interface is completely point-and-click, with little to no text and instructions are given verbally.The player is taken directly to the main page where Millie perches on a desk in front of a row of cubicles, each of which takes the player to a math or pre-math activity.There are seven different activities in this game, and each activity has two modes, Explore and Discover and Question and Answer. The first mode encourages the player to click around and experiment, emphasizing that he is in charge. In Question and Answer mode, which is entered by clicking the animal inside the picture frame, a character will ask the player to perform tasks related to the current area. The following descriptions apply to Question and Answer Mode only:  Little, Middle, &amp; Big -  the player is presented with three characters and an array of variously-sized shoes, each character will ask him to find a pair that fits their particular size.  Mouse House - after the player selects a simple or complex blueprint for a house, Frank Lloyd Mouse will ask him to find all the shapes to build it, one by one.  What's My Number? - standing concealed behind a curtain, Dorothy Duck tells the player how many objects she has, the player must select the same number and place them on the stage.  Bing &amp; Boing - bouncy creature Boing creates a picture pattern and repeats it with something missing, the player is asked to finish it. Each picture also has its own associated sound, and if the player has a microphone he can replace the sounds with his own.  Build-A-Bug - the rabbit shows the player a plan for the number of body parts the bug should have (3 eyes, 8 legs, for example), the player must click the correct number from the top of the screen and the body part from the left.  Number Machine -  Annie the worm will ask the player to find a specific number on the cash register. Choosing the icons on the bottom right will raise the numbers on the keys up to 30.

		<desc>On a world far away, many millennia ago, a race of advanced beings discovered the 'keys to the universe'. This enabled them to transcend space and time, and so they embarked on a journey to the far ends of the Cosmos. Before leaving their home world, they created the most advanced artificial intelligence ever devised to act as guardian and caretaker. This artificial intelligence was named MILO. But MILO was not a perfect creation, his systems required constant intellectual stimulation in order to maintain their incredible abilities. Without his creators nearby MILO became tired and depleted. As the millennia passed Milo's systems began to fail. Milo desperately needed stimulation in order to reverse his decline û he needs an encounter with YOU. MILO already knew about your arrival, long before you did, so he didn't waste any time and made preparations. A series of challenges and puzzles for you, which will recharge his intelligence circuits and reverse his decline. The challenges are spread around the home world of the creators and special transport has been provided. If you prove worthy of the challenge you will gain access to the library where you will come face to face with MILO, and if you finally succeed you will be presented with the treasured keys to the universe. But if you fail - you will be trapped forever.You are free to travel to every part of the planet and all you need is to do is solve the puzzles, which are very similar to the ones from  The 7th Guest.</desc>

		<desc>Over fifteen hundred years ago, the dwarves built the mines and the city above them, Dejenol. After centuries of digging, a floor gave way deep in the mines, and monsters began to pour out, killing the miners. The mines were eventually sealed, and remained so for over a thousand years. Now, the city elders have decided to reopen the mines, and cleanse them of their evil inhabitants. Having nearly run out of experienced adventurers, the city elders have decided to train new adventurers to take up this task. You are one such adventurer, tasked with searching and making safe The Depths of Dejenol.

The player forms a party by creating several characters of various races, and causing each to join some guilds to teach them useful skills. The party then adventures in the mines to gain experience, items, and gold, which may be spent at any of the several stores in order to buy equipment, companions, or information from the seer, as well as to gain levels at a guild or revive fallen characters.

Mordor has fifteen dungeon levels in addition to the town, 366 different items, and 400 different monsters, providing many hours of play.</desc>

If you try to solve a picture puzzle, you have to organize the pieces in the right order so you can see the picture. For example, a building could be mixed up and you have to rearrange the pieces so that they look like a building again. For numbers, on the first row, you would have 1, 2, and 3. On the second row, you would have 4, 5, and 6. on the 3rd row, you would have 7, 8, 9. You can also change the grid size to use more numbers or make the picture pieces smaller.</desc>

		<desc>Mr. Potato Head Saves Veggie Valley is a short educational adventure game with point-and-click controls. Veggie Valley has been beset by a terrible drought lately. Even more bad luck arrives as ominous clouds threaten the Country Fair. Mr. Potato Head and his daughter, Sweet Potato, decide to take matters into their own hands, save the fair and bring the clouds to Veggie Valley instead. The player controls both of them as they make their way across the valley, solve puzzles and visit the fair's many attractions.The game is intended for pre-school kids (less than 7 years) and has relatively simple puzzles. They consist mostly of gathering items in the inventory and using them on other objects from the world. Disguising the two potatoes represents an important element as well. Using the in-game editor, you can replace the eyes, nose, ears, shoes, mouth, add a clown wig, and so on. There are several mini games at the local fair, three of which (called Midway Games) can be accessed directly from the main menu: Funny Photo Booth, Counting Pinball and Match &amp; Catch Fishing. The first is another disguise editor, Counting Pinball is a pinball game that teaches the player to count, while Match &amp; Catch Fishing's main goal is to place pairs of identical fishes in the top jars. Both the mini games and the full adventure have two levels of difficulty.Similarly to other educational games of the era, the player can interact with many things from the world, not necessarily pertaining to puzzles or story advancement. This can trigger animations or speeches, giving a better idea on what the object actually is. The protagonists' and other characters' lines are fully-voiced.</desc>

Which kid wouldn't enjoy going into a toyshop where there are 97 different toys to play with? As you'd expect, it's no ordinary toyshop but a magical one, where everything comes to life and where children learn something new and fascinating every time they choose a different toy from the shelf.
Included with this program there is a parental guide that fully explains how to access each feature and how parents can monitor each child's pattern of play, subjects of interest and progress.
There are many painting activities that are fun and teach new skills of coordination through coloring-in with a mouse controlled paintbrush.
Charming illustrations and traditional style animation helps kids to learn modern technology facts without bewildering them with high-tech drawings and over-complicating diagrams.
In this Science Edition there are things to learn about the weather, sound, the environment, energy and animals. All are simply explained and illustrated.
Although based on educational curricula, Mr. Wonder has made sure the Greatest Toyshop on Earth is so much fun kids will spend hours playing without even realizing they're learning as well.</desc>

		<desc>Ms. Chomp is a single-player, shareware, Ms. Pac-Man clone for Windows. As in the original game the gameplay is entirely keyboard controlled. Ms. Chomp races around a maze eating dots for points and dodging ghosts. In the corners of the maze are power pills that turn the tables. After eating one of these Ms. Chomp becomes the hunter and, for a short while, is able to eat the ghosts. Points are scored when Ms. Chomp eats a dot, a ghost, or one of the items of fruit that appear in the maze. The player starts with three lives and additional lives are awarded for every 10000 points scored.The game has a few sound effects, music - but only at the start, and a high score table. It plays in a window and there are game configuration options in the menu bar at the top. Game speed is adjustable by means of an "animation delay" number between 0 and 10000, where zero gives the fastest game</desc>

		<desc>On the one hand, Ms. Metaverse is an interactive, futuristic and rather tacky beauty pageant. On the other hand, it's an interesting multimedia plug for developer Virtual Vegas' casino website, VirtualVegas.com.

As a judge for the future’s biggest beauty pageant, the Ms. Metaverse contest, you decide which of ten sassy ladies wins the crown. The contestants, real-life girls filmed and digitized, introduce themselves in full motion video clips, you pick five from the pool and go on judging them in the categories looks, brains and talent. While moving between the judging pavilions in colorful rendered video sequences, you earn money by shooting the contestants – “their artificial stupidity programs could do irreparable damage to Virtual Vegas if allowed to wander around unchecked”, explains the manual. Understood.

While the Looks contest seems to be a sorry excuse to stare at pics of scantily clad women (there’s no nudity in Ms. Metaverse), it also serves to identify males and / or cyborgs which might have slipped into the contest. The Brains and Talent contests display coarse videos of the contestants dancing or performing awkward sketches with Ms. Metaverse host Monty Megabyte (Chris Bonno). Watching these performances costs money, which you earn by shooting girls (see above) or playing a simple slot machine. After you’ve reviewed all the ladies, you may crown one Ms. Metaverse.

Ms. Metaverse offers content downloads via the included Mosaic Direct Browser – see trivia section for a detailed description.</desc>

		<desc>Heartfelt, but rather unrealistic wishes like ruling the world, unlimited processing power or an evening playing poker with three celebrities usually fall into the sphere of competence of a fairy. In case one happens to show up in your home: donÆt ask for that poker game. ThatÆs already been taken care of, thanks to New World Computing. NWC-mastermind Jon Van Caneghem invited three class B TV celebrities of the mid-90s for a day of green-screen filming. The result is called Multimedia Celebrity Poker.If youÆre into TV series, then youÆll probably have no trouble recognizing the faces of your opponents. Sitting at the poker table are Jonathan äRikerô Frakes (Star Trek: Next Generation), appearing somewhat tight-lipped, talkative comedian Joe Piscopo (Saturday Night Live), showing off his array of impersonations, and aging starlet Morgan Fairchild (Hotel, Falcon Crest), sitting stiff and generally trying not to look too lost. Digitized video clips, seamlessly integrated into the main frame, depict all actions and movements of the stars -- dealing, calling, playing cards. Separate clips for the three actors are played simultaneously to avoid äfreezingô of single persons, all are continuously in motion. The celebrities comment on the their cards and your success to create a relaxed and intimate atmosphere. The number of different statements is quite limited though, prepare to learn those one-liners by heart.Multimedia Celebrity Poker knows eight different variants of poker. You may play combinations of five cards or seven, stud or draw, lo-ball or high, deuces wild or normal. In any case, itÆs always you against the computer, a multiplayer option is not included. In addition to a relaxed round among friends, you can choose to advance levels in a tournament. You win if all opponents are broke, although nobody will undress at that point. Luckily. The programÆs poker skill is mediocre, itÆs playing fairly straight, rarely risking a bluff. The playing style of the three celebrities does not differ.Ready to join the game? On second thought, maybe you should wait for the fairy.</desc>

There are 18 cartoons in total, two for each dinosaur featured.Dinosaur Database has three educational sections in it. The Gallery section is a giant collection of 48 colorful illustrations. It lets you view one up close when you click on it on the right side. This is the educational section about those dinosaurs. The Names section has a list of 50 dinosaur names that can help you locate the dinosaur that you are trying to find in the gallery section, and lists two new dinosaurs that were not shown in the gallery. The choose section has four dinosaur fact groups that help you identify a dinosaur by its size, how it ate, what time period it lived in and what continent it lived on.Dinosaur Silhouettes is a game in which you have to identify a dinosaur that has been completely blackened. The game does not have different difficulty levels, continually goes on and there is no highscore.</desc>

		<desc>One of the myriad of indirect Myst descendants and sequel of sorts to Frankenstein: Through the Eyes of the Monster, Mummy is your standard first person adventure game from the mid-to-late nineties. You play the role of Michael Cameron, an investigator for the National Mining Company. One of your company's sites in Egypt has reached a bit of an impasse. It appears the workers there fear that they have come across sacred burial grounds and believe they have awakened a mummy. Your job is to investigate these claims (with the hope of proving them unsubstantiated so work can continue), all the while dealing with the Machiavellian-like site manager and the resident Egyptologist, who happens to be an old flame. Game play involves navigating static, rendered scenes, picking up and manipulating items and occasionally coming across someone, which leads to a short video conversation with them. You never get a choice in such conversations outside of potentially offering the other person an item to have or examine.</desc>

But, he must have the music in him! To save Julia you must demonstrate how talented you are with 41 musical tests, each containing 5 levels. See your computer turn into a piano, a saxophone, a guitar or even a harp. The main quest, de-popsicle-izing Julia, begins with her father Land O'ner, who starts you on a musical journey though her past. Travel through time to discover the great moments of Julia's life from birth to ice cube, as you solve puzzles which will reveal the musical instruments. Find all of them and you will have proved that music flows through your veins and, of course, Julia will melt and the world will regain its beloved pop star. The Music in Me was to be the cornerstone of a Music Chase series, but no more materialized. It's a totally niche product, which players will either love or hate.</desc>

		<desc>You have just stumbled upon a most intriguing book, a book titled Myst. You have no idea where it came from, who wrote it, or how old it is. Reading through its pages provides you with only a description of an island world. But it's just a book, isn't it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your hand on a page. Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with the island world the pages described. Now you're here, wherever here is, with no option but to explore.

Myst is a first-person point-and-click adventure where the player controls a character known as The Stranger. Magically transported into the world described in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its mysteries. The game is presented as a series of static scenes where the player acts with the environment by clicking and manipulating objects. There are no enemies and it is not possible to die. Through Myst Island, the game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books.

The game's interface is reduced to a single cursor for navigation and interaction. Rather than collecting items and using them to solve puzzles, the player must gather subtly placed clues and manipulate complex mechanical devices in order to advance in the game. The world of Myst is mostly uninhabited, and the game has very few live-action scenes with characters and dialogue.</desc>

		<desc>This is a sort of "dating simulator" if you will, closely related to another interactive movie, Man Enough. This one, however has more in the way of interaction and its humor makes it a more reasonably human experience (instead of being an all-out sexfest).You control a lucky guy who has been set up on a date with Sandi, a gorgeous and charming girl. Your objective?  To get her, of course! (this doesn't mean you get any sexual payoff from the game, though there's a lot of sexual innuendo, your conquest of Sandy is played more for the fun of it than for sex).Gameplay consists of verbal sparrings which trigger appropriate video sequences, to spice up the action, you also get some mini-games.</desc>

		<desc>An educational game for ages 8-12,  Nautical Number Hunt teaches mathematics as Wanda Wavelet recovers treasures from the ocean. Treasures are placed along a number line, and your job is to move the sub above the treasures with the power of math. For example, when learning addition, you will add or subtract a number from the sub's current location to move. The goal is to acquire as many treasures as possible before the treasure beam runs out of power. 26 lessons are included, including lessons in finding numbers, estimating, addition, fractions, and even multiplication. Also included is an exploration mode and a two-player mode (the two players compete to bring back the most expensive treasures).</desc>

		<video>./snap/Nelda Nockbladder's Anatomy Lesson (1997).mp4</video>
		<desc>Nelda Nockbladder's is a shareware platform puzzler, created with the Click &amp; Create multimedia authoring system. It combines varied "find out what to do" levels requiring timing and deduction from the player with some massive exuberant nonsensical humour extruding from each and every pore of the game -- beginning with the game's title, but certainly not ending there.

The unlikely heroine and protagonist of this game is middle-aged, good-natured Nelda Nockbladder -- part housewife, part sheep, part mad scientist -- who, while teleporting to the snack bar after her daily workout, finds herself trapped in anatomy lessons "due to a wrinkle in Neldaspace". The player's mission is to safely bring Nelda to the snack bar.

The game consists of eleven colourful levels -- the different lessons --, where Nelda will have to find out about what's going on and how to solve it. She has several means to achieve this: She can walk and jump, spit "flaming custard", climb things, hunker down and "ponder a greezbock" (which does absolutely nothing). The lessons contain various nondescript fast flying or gently bobbing objects (like the much-feared Elasticow or the Blue Plate Geelynob), switches and buttons to be pressed, everything often mutating or exploding when touching the floor, spat custard at, kicked or banged with the head.</desc>

		<desc>Noisy Video Poker and Blackjack for Windows is similar to the video machines found in casinos. Originally, Noisy Video Poker and Noisy Video Blackjack could be purchased separately or together. If bought together (on one disk), both games are accessible within all of the games by clicking your mouse on a bottom icon.It is called ôNoisyö for a reason. If you have a sound card, you will be treated to a variety of sounds during the game which will bring a smile to your face even when you lose.  When you win, you will hear coins dropping a metal coin tray.  When you lose, other sounds are played randomly.  There are explosion sounds, a car crash, a donkey, and other sounds, which can be turned off if you prefer.Betting is done with virtual imaginary coins, and the best pay-off (when you win, of course) can be had by betting the maximum of 5 coins. The game keeps track of your statistics and a complete manual can be accessed from the game menu.In Noisy Video Poker, choose from Jacks or Better, Joker Wild and Deuces Wild. The objective is to hold the best five card hand possible. A pair of jacks or better will return the amount of your bet.  Two pair, three of a kind, a straight, a flush, a full house, four of a kind, a straight flush, and a royal flush return increasingly greater pay-offs.  If you have no pairs or a pair of cards of lower value than jacks, you lose your bet.</desc>

		<desc>Oddballz is a spin-off from the Catz and Dogz series, from P.F. Magic.

This time, as the title states, the pets are wacky creatures, more alien-like than animal. Now they can make their eyes come out of their sockets and literally scare them to pieces, while retaining a comic look and feel (something impossible while dealing with Dogz or Catz).

The mechanics are pretty much the same in every game of the series, and here the player also gets to pet them, teach them tricks, punish them or just play around. The Oddballz will respond to each and every move and they can even morph into to something else, depending on what the player does.

The tools the player can use are also very different from the ones in Dogz and Catz, and also have a wacky feel to them. There are tools like the Robo Pogo, the Gravitron, Seismo Ball, Transformer, Atomic Ball, and the delicious Liqui-Food, for feeding the pets.

The company also made additional Oddballz available for download from their site, to add to the starting lot of seven.</desc>

There are racetracks, a dueling arena where the player can settle scores with rivals without interference from the IS Enforcers, and a strange Inner Demon whom the player must ultimately learn to defeat in order to win the game. The player can select from dozens of ships and their variations to play, or create them using the Ship Factory, and upgrade the player's ship capabilities with weapons and equipment bought from the ambulance or salvaged from destroyed ships. The game also includes a screen saver.</desc>

		<desc>Oregon Trail II is a sequel to Oregon Trail. The game follows the basic structure of the predecessor, which is a simulation of traveling through towns and wilderness in the state of Oregon, with adventure-like gameplay elements and educational material. The sequel changes, enhances, and adds many gameplay features.In the beginning of the game players choose their name, occupation, level, date of travel, starting point and destination, as well as the type of wagon. The game also allows the player to create virtual companions for the journey, designating their number, names, and ages. As opposed to one year in the first game, the sequel allows the player to choose between twenty years of travel, from 1840 to 1860.The player is able to choose an occupation for the protagonist, such as banker, doctor, gunsmith, carpenter, journalist, butcher, pastor, artist, and many others. Different occupations bestow various bonuses to the protagonist, and are equipped with passive skills, which will influence the rate of success during certain random events and activities. For example, a high medical skill will make it more likely that the protagonist recovers from a disease, sharpshooting skill contributes to the instant-kill rate when hunting animals, etc.The game retains the supply-managing, trading, sailing, and most other elements of its predecessor. There are more interactive events in the sequel, as the protagonist is able to consult other characters and react differently to some of the events that might occur during the journey.</desc>

		<desc>One of Origin's least known releases is a solid screensaver collection that features posters and scenes from famous Origin games (e.g. Wing Commander and Ultima). The screensaver modules are not as varied in style as LucasArts' underrated Star Wars Screen Entertainment-- they are mostly just slideshows including a lot of random graphical effects. What makes the package stands out, though, is the inclusion of many images and characters from Origin's popular games... you will see and hear Ultima 7's Guardian loom large on screen, booming his famous growls, many images in the package are from unreleased versions of games or posters. As an added bonus, Origin FX includes a module that plays the cinematic sequences when Wing Commander II is installed on your hard drive. Not that this can't be accomplished by using homemade hacks, but it's still quite neat.</desc>

Balthasar is afraid of the animals he's supposed to be studying, so he's relieved when Oscar agrees to help him out.Gameplay and hand-painted appearance is similar to other Tivola games developed by BVM, such as the previous Oscar the Balloonist title and Millie Meter and Her Adventures in the Oak Tree. Actions are performed with the mouse, and clicking on items activates animations. There is a row of icons at the bottom of the screen for accessing games, returning to the lake, changing seasons, changing language, and exiting.Oscar's balloon is divided into four quadrants, one for each season - clicking on one of the tree pictures will bring up that season on the lake, and the animals around it will explain how they live at that time of the year. There are 12 mini-games, five of which are available to play from the start - the other seven are hidden in the game and only become accessible as the player uncovers them.</desc>

		<desc>A young physics professor named Lester conducts a particle experiment. Suddenly, something goes wrong, a lightning strikes, and in a moment Lester finds himself in a strange alien world. Now he must fight for his life, first with his bare hands, then with a gun he finds. But what gives him courage is that he is not alone. One of the aliens who escapes from the prison together with him helps him on his dangerous quest. Friendship can overcome all the obstacles.Another World (Out of This World in the US) combines shooting, platforming, and puzzle-solving elements. The game is divided into stages, some of them are straightforward and can only be accessed one time, while others are connected to each other, constituting a larger environment. Exploration and problem-solving are emphasized. Many levels include challenges not seen in the previous ones. Tasks may involve environmental puzzles, timed sequences, precise jumping, and combat.Typically, enemies are defeated by using an energy gun found in an early stage. The gun's regular function is shooting energy projectiles. By pressing down and holding the fire button the player can activate an energy shield which protects Lester from regular attacks, allowing him to fire from relative safety until it evaporates. Finally, by holding the fire button even longer the gun creates powerful blasts which can disrupt shields. Most enemies are equipped with similar guns and are able to perform the same actions as Lester. Fighting enemies therefore requires tactical usage of regular attacks, shields, and bombs, as well as learning enemy patterns.Each level can be accessed by typing a code the player learns after having completed the level. If Lester dies, the level must be restarted. There is no on-screen interface and no in-game dialogue in the game. Vector graphics are used for creating the game's environments and animated cutscenes.</desc>

A single corporation decided the only way for survival was to colonize other worlds.  One ship was launched and as it sat in orbit around Jupiter, Earth was no more.  Now it is your task to seek out a new planet and repopulate it with human life.  The game is set in an isometric third person perspective, like that of SimCity, in which you must re-colonize the planet while dealing with the intricacies of day-to-day life.</desc>

This cosmic resort will challenge your intellect, your sexual desires and every erotic fantasy. The babes on this planet are hotter and sluttier than anything you've seen on earth. So come and enjoy the ride, but be careful ... the landing can be tricky! Some slick CGI opens the game, with several starfighters battling to the death in a stunning 3D sequence. The survivor lands at the supposedly deserted Outpost 69, where, it's rumored, a few lonely (and horny) female inhabitants may remain. Eager to see what further intrigue awaits us, we exit the cool cockpit of our fighter, hop into the photo-realistic landing bay, and walk straight into... yet another take on the "find-the-key/click-on-the-hot-button-for-sex" scenarios that we've seen so many times before in adult video-gaming.</desc>

		<desc>Paulie Python is a snake that is hungry for mice. Your task is to guide the green python through various scrolling levels and eat all mice in each of them. However, the mice are often scattered around the level, so you have to search for them first. With each eaten mouse, Paulie grows a bit, making it more difficult to avoid his own tail. You must neither crash into the tail nor the walls, otherwise you will lose a life. Another hazard you might encounter are white balls that bounce around and kill your character when they hit his head. Keep in mind that Paulie's tail stays the same size when you advance to the next level. The same happens when Paulie dies and has to restart a level, while all previously eaten mice reappear. This means that the python grows to an enormous size during the course of the game.</desc>

		<desc>Pilgrim is an adventure game set in the Middle Ages after the Crusades during the 13th century. It is the time of the Knights Templar, the Black Plague and the Inquisition when many were tortured and burned at the stake because of their religious beliefs.Summoned to his father's side, Simon (your character) is told that he must obtain a valuable manuscript in a secret room and deliver it only to Petrus, a friend who lives in Toulouse. His pleading hints that this mission might be dangerous, but Simon agrees even though he doesn't understand. Shortly thereafter, his father dies. The interaction begins in the library as you start Simon's adventure.This is a first person, point and click game with a somewhat unconventional interface. The inventory contains objects which can be used as well as clicked on during conversations. Icons of the people Simon has met or heard about also act as conversation topics when clicked on. The game features an in-game hint system which provides very vague clues to the many puzzles Simon will encounter. A comprehensive encyclopedia is accessible at any time to document and elaborate upon the historical facts of the era and to the game itself. Angels, demons and people from all walks of life will help (or hinder) Simon's progress towards his goals as he travels around France's towns and countryside. Locations are varied with marketplaces, villages, a ruined fortress, gothic churches and, later, fanciful environments. Puzzles include several mechanical problems, helping other characters with objects and information as well as creative environment manipulation.</desc>

		<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".</desc>

		<desc>Pippi Longstocking is a well-known fictional character in northern Europa. She is a little girl that never grows up and lives with no adults in Villa Villekulla, an abandoned house, with a horse (with no name) and a monkey, Mr. Nilsson. She says her mother is in heaven and her father is king of a pacific island. But who really knows ? The original stories, written by Astrid Lindgren since 1945, were adapted into films and television series. Here, is a computerized version where children will discover her little world. First, they'll have to enter Villa Villekulla, by the door, of course.Players will explore the rooms in the Villa (hall, kitchen, bureau, bedroom, and attic) and solve different types of puzzles (i.e. jigsaw, memory). There's also a book activity where children can choose among three books and start these stories with screen texts that can be turned on or off. Texts are available in twelve (say, eleven because of British/American english) different languages.</desc>

		<desc>Playskool Puzzles is a set of five educational puzzles intended for kids aged 3 to 6:Explore It! - The player chooses between four pictures (Park, House, Beach and Farm). Each location will have different elements and objects removed and placed randomly at the bottom of the screen. The main objective is to reassemble the picture by sticking the objects in their corresponding areas. Once the image is back to its original form, the player can click on some of its elements to explore them. For example, after completing the park, clicking on the circus within it will trigger a new such puzzle. Clicking on a particular object in the final exploration puzzle will reveal a separate animation featuring it and its name. This way, the kids can learn new words and associate them.Puzzle Maker - A puzzle editor. Using the toolbox and a selection of premade objects, the user can create new puzzles or modify existing ones. Puzzle Maker will automatically import the last picture seen while playing any of the other puzzles. The picture can be cut in three different ways and after that you need to reassemble it as it's normally done in Jigsaw.Connect the Dots - Clicking the numbers or letters in their correct numerical or alphabetical order will trace the margin of an object. After connecting all the dots correctly, the game will show the full object, its name and an animation for it.Mix and Match - It involves combining different body parts to obtain a funny-looking character.Jigsaw - An ordinary jigsaw puzzle.In every puzzle it's possible to modify the original image's colors and draw other stuff on it using the toolbox. The result can usually be saved or printed. There are three difficulty settings: Easy, Medium and Hard.</desc>

It is the third game in  Diversions Software's Prairie Dog series.Prairie dogs, genus Cynomys, are burrowing rodents native to the grasslands of North America. They are a pest and this game is all about blasting them as they run from burrow to burrow, a bit like a Whac-A-Mole game with guns.There are two kinds of game play, the timed mode and the open season mode. Both are essentially the same but only the timed mode scores are added to the highscore table. The game has sound effects, sniper scope, variable game speed, a high score table and three difficulty  levels. Aiming and shooting is mouse controlled but the keyboard is used to vary the scope's magnification.The open season mode and the ability to change the size of the ammo clip are not available in the shareware version.</desc>

		<desc>Prince became a major international music star in 1984 with the release of "Purple Rain" and his blend of rock, funk, soul and dance music has kept him popular ever since.  He was an early proponent of computer technology to deliver music whether it be through the internet or in a 3D multimedia experience such as this CD-ROM. At the time, Prince was in a battle with Sony over control of his music and was not using his name but instead used a symbol or glyph which looked like this stood on end...   o(+&amp;gt, The Myst-clone type of experience is a quest to collect the five pieces of PrinceÆs symbol, as you go through each beautifully rendered "virtual reality" world of his Foyer, Studio, Library, Grand Hallway, Dance Club, Boudoir, Virtual Video Room and Candle Room.The structure you journey through is also in the shape of the artist's symbol. There are 11 simple puzzles to solve in order to get clues to play videos and collect the pieces that when all gathered you will see a special final exclusive video.There are hundreds of music samples, video clips, and interactive objects many of which  provide a history of Prince's life, music, albums, posters and friends. There are several mini games such as a working mixing console and DJ deck.There are four full-length music videos, including two new songs: 'Interactive' and 'Endorphin Machine.'  The music studio has a karaoke version of 'Kiss,' and in the private club Eric Clapton, Little Richard, George Clinton, and Miles Davis share their views about him.</desc>

		<desc>Proliferation is a formerly-shareware World War III strategy game for up to six players, human- or computer-controlled. Nuclear weapons, both tactical and strategic, have proliferated throughout the nations of the world, and the five largest nuclear powers, after failed efforts to militarily compel the smaller nuclear-armed nations to disarm, have plunged the world into global war. You take the role of one of the five major nuclear powers, seeking to extend your sphere of influence and eventually become the dominant power.

The game is graphically simple but has a high degree of depth and complexity. You manage both conventional and nuclear forces, economic factors, and military production. The main commodities are population, food, and oil, and the latter two must be maintained in sufficient quantity to allow the former to produce. In addition, all players must worry about increasing global and local radiation levels resulting from the use of nuclear weapons.

The author, Dion Kurczek of Silicon Commander Games, has released the game to the public as freeware.</desc>

		<desc>Putt-Putt and Fatty Bear's Activity Pack contains 15 different games and activities for kids 3-8. This is basically a compilation of the Putt-Putt Funpack and Fatty Bear Funpack, along with a few new games. Most of the games are played against either Putt-Putt or Fatty Bear.		 Some games are traditional, such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Checkers, Reversi, or the card game Go Fish.Others are renamed versions of popular games. "Remember!" is basically Concentration, a memory game. "The Cheese King" is Hangman, while the "On-Ramps &amp; Off Ramps" is the board game chutes &amp; ladders. "Word Hunt!" is the device in puzzle books where you find words in letter grids. In "Guess It!", you use logic to figure out which fruits are used and which locations they've been placed in. "Lines &amp; Boxes"  is another logic game, making boxes by drawing lines between a grid of dots.Finally, Tangrams is a spatial recognition game, fitting pieces into different shapes. Most of these games have multiple difficulty levels. Although designed for children 3-8, many of the games should give even parents the occasional run-for-the-money at the Hardest level.Finally, there are four games just for fun: In "Circus Stormin'" - a side-scrolling arcade game - you control Putt-Putt up and down, moving him around obstacles and having him pick up balloons. There's also a sliding tiles (logic puzzle) game with slightly varying images, and a Pachinko pinball where you can create your own 'field' of 6x11 bumpers and the balls make amusing sounds when they hit. There's also a 35-page in-game coloring coloring book with 16 mixable palette slots.</desc>

Using the mouse, move Putt-putt across the screen, bouncing Pep on the seats or dashboard. Different balloons are introduced during the game including candy balloons which gives the player 50 points for each piece of candy caught, paint-bucket balloons which change the player's color depending on the balloon, and question mark balloons which gives the player a power-up such as Fireman Pep. The game also has a level builder.</desc>

		<desc>Promised Land is a multimedia adventure game based around the members of the progressive-rock band Queensrÿche.

The premise of the game is all about the symbol or totem of the band (called the "Tri-rÿche"), which is composed of five parts, and at the beginning of the game it scatters every piece in a different "world", and each of these worlds happen to be created by each of the band member's dreams and worries.

So your job is to find each of the pieces and rebuild the totem, and to accomplish this you'll have to solve puzzles and minigames. As you find each piece, the band member who "owns" that world lets you have a glimpse of his work in the band in the form of musical videos.

		<desc>Radio Active bills itself as The Music Trivia Game Show. Up to four players can compete and each chooses from a set of 16 avatars to represent them. The avatars are all digitized actors and fall into a number of stereotypes such as the fitness instructor, the rebel, the cheerleader, the pirate, the surfer dude, the cover girl, the cowboy, and the nerd. The players take turns answering trivia questions covering music from 1961 to 1985. A player spins the wheel to select a time span of 4-5 years in which the question will fall. The player then chooses either an easy, medium, or hard question, worth 100, 200, or 300 points, respectively. The game asks a question and gives the player a set period of time in which to select from among 16 possible answers. The player has one opportunity to get it wrong. If the player is wrong twice then the next player gets to try the same question. However, if the player gets the question right, then they get the points as well as a point bonus corresponding to the time remaining when the question was correctly answered. After answering a textual question correctly, a player has the opportunity to identify a music melody.Another type of question is the video question. A person will recite clues about a particular musician they once worked with and the player has to choose from among 16 possible answers. Further, the game throws an extended round every 3 rounds. In the extended round, there are actually 3 correct answers among the 16 and each is worth points.</desc>

		<desc>Very much a snake game, Rattler Race adds a few twists to the long-held conventions of the genre (those being: you guide a snake from a top-down perspective, always in forward motion, it eats its targets and grows in length, but dies should it collide with any obstacles): in addition to a competing snake foiling your routes, a ball bounces around the play-field, Pong-style, killing your snake should the ball ricochet against its head.The other standout qualities are largely cosmetic: periodically enemy movement "freezes", giving the player a period of free motion, the opposing snake will also "eat" your targets (here "apples" -- occasionally bonus "golden apples") and grow longer, though it doesn't seek them out, gameplay can be conducted with as many as three opposing snakes and three bouncing balls complicating the playfield at once, you head for the exit once all apples are eaten, but the enemy snake(s) can exit instead, restarting the level.  Triumph against all these odds and you get 29 more levels of similar gameplay!This unremarkable clone is largely known on account of having been included in the original Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows.</desc>

In other sequences he stands behind a mixer and plays appropriate music respectively mixes his own.During the game there are several other raving persons who are invited to join the Rave Shuttle. Conversations are held in multiple choice style. The soundtrack consists as expected of techno and house music.</desc>

		<desc>Scholastic's The Magic School Bus Explores Inside the Earth is the fourth game in the educational science series based on books by Joanna Cole and Bruce Degen. When Arnold discovers he is missing some of the rocks and minerals from his collection, Mrs. Frizzle decides to take the class on a field trip to replace them. The group will board the bus and travel to various places around the Earth, including the Grand Canyon, inside a geode, at volcanoes on the earth and undersea, in a cavern, and at a fault to look for the replacement rocks.The interface is point and click, travel is accomplished by clicking the gear shift in the front of the bus, selecting a location and pressing the GO! button. From outside the bus, the cursor will change to a drilling bus or an airplane bus in some locations, and can be clicked to travel to another area. Areas can be visited in any order at all and returned to at any time. The bus is divided between front and back - in the back the player will find experiments to perform on rock samples, as well as a dress-up activity and a kitchen where he can investigate the effects of heat, gas, and pressure on the samples.At each of the sites, clicking on features, signs, and characters may open site-specific minigames, information and further activities as the player gathers information to track down the missing minerals.This game focuses on geology concepts with an emphasis on experiment, investigation and the scientific process.</desc>

		<desc>In this second Magic School Bus game based on the educational book series from Joanna Cole and Bruce Degen, Ms. Frizzle and her class take a trip inside classmate Arnold's body. From Arnold's head to his toe, the group travels through every system, including the Upper and Lower Digestive System, the Circulatory System, the Respiratory System, Liver, Nervous System and the skin. Only when all the areas and 12 body parts have been visited can the class leave Arnold's body through one of three natural exits.All actions in this game are performed with the mouse. In the classroom, selecting the skeleton brings up a game of reassembling its bones, clicking on the science projects on the other side of the room trigger animations. Once the bus is selected, the journey begins as the miniaturized vehicle zooms into Arnold's mouth. The player navigates through his body by clicking the steering wheel and selecting directional signs from the bus windshield, each place will lead to at least one other, and all lead to the nervous system from where any section can be visited. On the lower left sits Liz, the class mascot, who can be clicked for help. Clicking the rear view mirror takes the player to the back of the bus, where he can choose Tim's knapsack to access a drawing program, or Ralphie's handheld to play a game related to the current body part. As the player journeys through the body the places he has visited are recorded on a map in the glove box as well as stamped in a travel log, so he can see what has been missed. Unlike later Magic School Bus games, the player is unable to exit the bus, all the action takes place inside and in the classroom.</desc>

		<desc>Scholastic's The Magic School Bus Explores the Ocean is the third game in the series based on the children's educational books by Joanna Cole and Bruce Degen. In this adventure, Ms. Frizzle and her class are headed to the ocean on a mission to explore zones and answer three clues that will lead to a sunken treasure. Traveling by submarine bus, the group will make stops at the Coral Reef, the Open Ocean, the Deep Ocean, the Hot Vents, the Kelp Forest, and more. At each stop the player can access activities, reports and experiments related to that zone by clicking on items nearby. There are also a number of zone-themed minigames that utilize both the mouse and the arrow keys. Among them are:  Crab Chase - the player must click to move a crab around on the beach and collect food while avoiding a predatory seagull.  Ride the Tide - the player helps a fish swim through the tidal changes by moving with the arrow keys and jumping over rocks with the space bar.  Kelp Clean-Up - collect and bag up garbage while avoiding sharks.  Food Chain Game - a jigsaw puzzle featuring colorful diatoms.  Lantern Fish Game - the player must help a lantern fish gulp down its prey while moving through the oceanThere are two ways to move around, from the inside of the bus the player can click on the steering wheel and the gearshift, and while outside the bus he is able to scroll from screen to screen by selecting the arrows or clicking the submarine cursor. Zones may be visited in any order. Once the player has collected enough clues and travels to the area where the treasure is buried, he will find a treasure scanner to uncover it, and the game is won.This game is suggested for ages 6 - 10, and the educational focus is on scientific exploration and experimentation, rather than simple fact-finding.</desc>

		<desc>In this first game in the series, Ms. Frizzle is lost as soon as the bus flies off into space and the goal of the game is to locate her using the clues she provides. This is essentially a computer version of the book The Magic School Bus Lost in the Solar System and the cartoon episode "The Magic School Bus Lost in Space,". The Friz's hiding place varies throughout the game. As would become the standard for the remainder of the games in the original software series, the main screen consists of the bus's dashboard, where the user can "drive" the bus to any of the nine planets or Earth's moon. Since Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune lack solid surfaces, the bus instead lands on one of their moons (Io for Jupiter, Mimas for Saturn, Miranda for Uranus and Triton for Neptune.) Once on a planet, the user can exit the bus, where a strange satellite called the "whatsit" must be clicked on to bring up an arcade-styled game in which the user, controlling one of the students, must collect one of Ms. Frizzle's tokens (giant coins with Ms. Frizzle's face on them) which provide the user with a clue as to the Friz's whereabouts and activate the "Friz-finder." There are only three clues available, but tokens will still need to be collected to activate the "Friz-finder" after all the clues have been exhausted. Clicking on the "Friz-finder" will determine whether Ms. Frizzle is anywhere on the current planet. If she is, then the game is completed, but if she is not then the user will have to collect another token to activate the "Friz-finder" to try again. There are also a bunch of different surprises, including a singing barbershop group of rocks called "the Cratertots".</desc>

		<desc>Enter a magically interactive dreamscape through which you wander and make astonishing discoveries. Or just relax and savor the paintings, poetry and music that ebb and flow at your command. Navigate through a banquet of interwoven images, metaphoric icons, audible symbols, and words. Most software titles merely allow you to open files and manipulate data. This allows you to open your mind and manipulate your perspective. Immerse yourself in art. Like nothing you have ever seen before - and never on a computer screen. It's art. It's entertainment. It's engaging. It's a window into yourself. Based on a handmade book of collage art by New York artist Tennessee Rice Dixon, images dominate the screen. Traditional imagery is transferred into the electronic age with more than 250 QuickTime sequences seamlessly integrated into the background. The story they tell is the human struggle through stages of life: birth, death, confrontation, reunion, romance and progeny. You explore these stages from a masculine or feminine point of view by clicking on a moon or sun. Once you choose a path, you're captivated with wild scenes such as stallions morphing into seahorses that turn in circles against the night sky. A mixture of poetry and sound complete the experience. text, read by a man and a woman, is taken from sources that include the Tibetan Book of the Dead, the Bible and the Bhagavad Gita. It is the sound, however, that empowers you. As you move across hot spots, one area emits classical music, while another activates birds cooing or the sound of a heartbeat against chirping crickets.</desc>

		<desc>Together with the lovable Muppet Elmo, of the long-running children's television program Sesame Street, preschoolers can navigate through educational and entertaining activities. Elmo plays the role of both playmate and tutor as children practice number, letter, sound, shape, and color recognition, as well as spelling and critical thinking.

The activities all take place within five unique playrooms, each emphasizing a specific preschool concept. Activities included are The Music Room (Find a Sound, Finish a Sound Pattern), Letters Room (Find a Letter, Make an Animal Name), Face Treehouse (Make a Face, How Would You Feel?), Shapes and Colors Tent (Find A Shape), and the Numbers Clubhouse (Find A Number, The Counting Game). All can be visited in any order and revisited at any time.

Each room has two different structured games and non-structured "freeplay" activities that teach specific skills. When entering a room, the child can immediately begin "freeplay" actions or click on the star or moon symbol located in each room for the games (the game accessed by clicking on the star symbol is easier than the moon game).</desc>

		<desc>An educational game designed to help children recognize and name objects.  The game has several famous characters from the Sesame Street show, including Big Bird, Elmo, Oscar the Grouch, The two headed Monster and Guy Smiley as your host.  It's formatted as a game show with mini games that encourage spelling, reading and identifying words.  Several of the characters provide instructions on the mini game and provide assistance when needed.  As with many educational games aimed at preschoolers, every object performs a nifty little animation when clicked on.  The cast from the TV series performs most of the voices.  Kermit is missing, possibly due to the unfortunate loss of Jim Henson in 1990.</desc>

		<desc>Using the same graphical interface as Deja Vu, Shadowgate is an adventure game set in a fantasy world. Players take the part of an adventurer sent to the ancient keep of Shadowgate on a quest to find a mystic artifact known as the Staff of Ages and stop the evil Warlock Lord from summoning a horrific demon known as the Behemoth. However, Shadowgate has become infested with the Warlock Lord's demonic minions, not to mention the castle's still functional booby-traps.

Unlike Deja Vu, death comes at the protagonist suddenly, unexpectedly and, most of all, often. Such simple acts as pulling the wrong switch or opening the wrong door can cause the hero to be skewered by a booby-trap or disemboweled by a monster. If the player character's torch burns out (this happens quite regularly) and the player forgets to light a new one, the protagonist will trip in the dark and break his neck.</desc>

		<desc>Civilization has the widest scope of any strategy game of its time. You are a leader of a nation. You begin in the Stone Age, and complete the game in the XXIth century (unless your civilization gets destroyed earlier). Your eventual goal is to become the dominant civilization in the world, either by wiping out everybody else, or being the first to get a space ship to Alpha Centauri.As the nation's leader, you have many responsibilities. You have to build cities, and then micromanage them, constructing various buildings. Most of people in your cities will be working on the neighbouring lands to get food (without it, your city won't survive or grow), production (used to build military units and buildings) and trade (which can be exchanged for money, science (see below) or luxuries that make people happy. You decide how much trade you want to invest into each of these areas.) You have to make sure that your people are in a good mood, if they get too unhappy, the city will collapse into disorder, and won't produce anything until you fix the situation. If you're ambitious, you can build Wonders of the World - epic constructions, such as the Pyramids or the Hoover Dam. Each Wonder is an unique thing, and only one of each can exist in the world. They give you a lot of benefits if you complete them, but they take a long time to build, and many of them will eventually stop working. There are other nations in the world, and there are also barbarians, so you'll have to invest into the military to protect yourself and to attack. Sure, you can sign peace treaties with other nations, and even exchange scientific knowledge with them (although sometimes they'll demand tribute from you), but eventually you'll probably have to fight. You control each of your military units on the world map, attacking your opponents' units and cities (possibly taking over them). Not all units are for combat though. Settlers are used to build cities, create roads (for easier travel of your units) and improve the land around cities, increasing production. Diplomats can be sent to foreign cities to negotiate with the other nations or create embassies, but they can also bribe enemy units to join you and conduct espionage and sabotage in the enemies' cities. Caravans can be sent to faraway cities to increase trade in their home city, and they can also help in building Wonders of the World. Scientific progress is an important part of the game. The more science your cities produce, the faster you </desc>

		<desc>Starting out with just a single unit and knowledge of a small local area, your challenge is to guide your civilization into becoming the dominant force, either by conquering every other civilization or by sending a spaceship to Alpha Centauri.As you'd imagine, a lot of challenges come into such a task. You must locate cities so as to make use of food, construction and trade resources, which can be later improved by constructing irrigation, roads, mines, railroads, and farmland. Each city can construct one item at a time - civilian and military units, buildings or Wonders of the World (there are 28 of these across the different eras of the game, and each can be possessed by only one city). The buildings and wonders have different effects - most buildings and some wonders improve defenses, scientific research, trade or food output, but most wonders offer unique advantages that can be used to great strategic effect.There are over 100 scientific advancements in the game, and most require prerequisites before they can be researched. How quickly this happens depends on your scientific output, which must be traded off against financial and military concerns.Combat can occur in cities or in the open terrain - things like forests and mountains give the defense an advantage. Unlike in the original Civilization, fights aren't always won outright - most times the winning unit will be damaged, reducing its movement speed and attacking prowess until it's repaired, but the losing unit always disappears from game. If multiple units are in a square that come sunder attack, the strongest unit fights - unless it is a city or Fortress, all units will be lost if the fight is lost. Once a city has no defensive units left, it can be captured. Certain units have the ability to cover all squares as fast as if they were roads, only a few can see submarines, and air units require re-fueling in a friendly city.There are up to 6 other Civilizations in the game, and keeping good diplomatic relations with these is crucial. At times you may want to trade knowledge or pool military resources with a neighbor - at others they may want to destroy you. If you make deals and go back on them your reputation is affected.</desc>

The three choices presented are actually integral parts of the script. The player must select one of the options by clicking on the number (or the line of dialog), or using the numbers on the keyboard. The decisions made by the user determine which direction the story takes, up to the next Action/Dialog Interface box. As the player continues through the game, he'll be presented with a multitude of crises which must be prioritized and dealt with appropriately. Depending on his decisions, he may reach several types of endings, from death to survival, and some humorous ones.</desc>

		<desc>SimCity sets you as the mayor of a new municipality, with the responsibility of building and maintaining a place where citizens can move to and work and be happy. The first task is to place essentials such as housing, transport links, schools, factories and shops. There are 50 types of these, allowing for homes of all standards and different types of businesses. Make sure to consider which sites are effective for which tasks. Some power sources pollute, others don't but are more expensive. Taxes must be raised to ensure an income, and then portions allocated to public services such as policing and roads. Earthquakes, floods and fires are all emergency situations that must be dealt to contain any damage.

Successful mayoring will cause the small village to grow into a town, then a city and finally a metropolis. As the city's size grows so do it's needs. Commercial buildings may suddenly find that they need an airport to expand trade, or housing may find itself changing rapidly as vast amounts of people come and leave.

The game also includes 8 pre-defined time-limited scenarios, with specific challenges and targets. The environment varies in each game (especially if you have the Terrain Editor add on), and this should affect your choices.</desc>

		<desc>Simon is a simple implementation of Ralph Baer's electronic game Simon (itself an adaptation of Atari's ill-fated Touch Me), iconic symbol of the '80s, the game rules are so primitive as to be practically instinctual -- each button is associated with a tone, and the player's goal is to reproduce button-sequences produced randomly by the computer, growing by an additional press with every iteration.  The challenge lies in seeing for how long the player can faithfully reproduce the expanding sequences without making a mistake.Unlike the original four-button Simon machine, this game's interface has five buttons.</desc>

		<desc>Made by Maxis, the company famous for its line of "Sim" games, SimPark deals with the simulation and management of a real wildlife park.  SimPark allows you to build and manage parks from scratch, completely isolated from civilization.  You have the choice of choosing from hundreds of different species of flowers, bushes, plants, mammals, birds, and reptiles to live and thrive in your park.  Which plants and animals to put in is completely your choice, but you have to make sure that their biological needs are met so that they won't die.  You start out with a bare patch of land, but as you add plants and animals, it will begin to grow.  Depending on the climate and food available, certain animals will even begin migrating to your park.  SimPark contains a massive database of plants and animals that you need to use in order for your park to flourish.  Over hundreds of species are cataloged in SimPark, and each article includes a brief bio, their scientific name, their wants and needs, and even an authentic recording of what each animal sounds like.  You need to utilize this information to figure out what plants and animals to put in your park, in order for the creatures to flourish.  If a creature or plant does not get enough food, a plant does not like the climate, or trees do not get the amount of water they need, your park will not grow.When plants and animals are placed incorrectly, the park becomes unstable.  Weeds and animals will begin to overpopulate the park.  Other trees will die or get overeaten by rampaging species.  Because of this, the game tries to teach the concept of a "balanced ecosystem."  It is up to you to have an understanding of the animals in your park to preserve a balance.  Only through a perfectly balanced biological system can all of the creatures flourish.Besides the biological aspect, there is also the managerial aspect of it.  Above all, it is up to you to manage the budget for the park.  Planting trees and adapting animals costs money, and if you can't manage that money, you're fired.  Even though you get federal funding each year, it is also important to attract visitors to the park to make a little income.  You need to make provisions for humans, like paths and bathrooms.  You also have to make sure visitors behave and do not litter or ravage the park.  Besides this, you also have the duty to identify species in your park, through a mini-game which has you identify them through their characteristics.  As well, you may  have </desc>

		<desc>Maxis takes their Sim-building line vertical with SimTower, an original concept from Japan (where vertical living is much more commonplace than in many parts of the world). Your goal is to build a skyscraper that is both tall, aethestically pleasing, popular, and, most importantly, economically profitable. To be successful, your building cannot just be levels upon levels of officespace, or just an apartment sky-rise, but a multi-functional haven for humanity featuring everything from penthouses to theatres, restaurants to shopping malls. The centerpiece of your tower design is your elevators and proper managment is the key.You can watch your Sims enter and leave your grand tower, getting impatient waiting for elevators, or having a hectic work day at the office. You can even train in on one or two, to server as a metering stick for their compatriots, or just to peek into the average workday of the little people living in your building. Or watch the security and resuce crews race as distasters like bomb threats and fires rampage through your well-crafted skyscraper.</desc>

		<desc>SimTown is one of several entries in the city-building simulation series, SimCity. As in prior installments, players are tasked as the mayor of a newly formed municipality, taking charge of it's expansion and success. Being aimed at a younger audience than that of the other games within the series a greater emphasis is placed on managing a small, socially ideal town than a sprawling metropolis. As such it features a much more stylized, cartoon representation and user interface, a number of added features allowing for greater interactivity with the populace, and a simplified system of resource management.As their first priority as mayor players will simply need to construct a town, supplying not only housing for their residents but employment, schools, and civic buildings as well, Roadways and bike paths being needed to connect them all. While each building has its own associated costs and benefits they're often marginal enough that a player's selection will often be as much an aesthetic consideration as a functional one. In order to finance all of this consideration will also have to be paid to the player's limited resources of water, wood, and crops, which rejuvenate only so quickly.Interacting with the populace will also be crucial to success. Individual citizens will often offer suggestions and make demands of the mayor and so a close eye will have to be kept on their opinions of how the city is being run. Those that favor specific types of restaurants will request them and objections will be made if the city is lacking in their preferred form of recreation. Players can also take a closer look at their residents by 'removing' the tops of buildings and peering inside, watching their life unfold on a more minute scale. Specially constructed designer characters can also be made to populate the town, built to pre-defined specifications such as their preferred clothing and personal preferences.A number of awards can be gained within the game for exemplary achievements resulting from maintaining a balanced town for some period of time. An in-game newspaper will assist in these efforts by helping to keep the player up to date on what might be wrong in their city, or how they might be succeeding.</desc>

SimTunes is an interactive 'painting/music/simulation' game. The user paints colored squares on a virtual grid, where each color maps to a tone in a musical scale. Then the user unleashes four little 'bugz' to roam around on the painted grid. Each bugz has an instrument or vocal style associated with it, and when it walks over one of the squares of light it 'plays' its sound at that tone. The user can control the scale, the instruments, and the speed and direction of the bugz, creating an interactive musical experience.</desc>

		<desc>In this 3-D multimedia novel, Hyleyn is a young girl trapped in the slums of Thalissar, an enclosed city on an environmentally inhospitable planet. No one important remains - the rich and powerful leave, and those who cannot are relegated to a seedy, backwater existence amid the incessantly howling, eerie winds of the decaying megalopolis. Outside contact is minimal. From time to time the Corporation sends out a ship to ensure its interests are maintained, and even more rarely Thalissar is visited by the Sinkhas who are immortal beings who maintain benign order in the net of aligned worlds. They travel aboard the living starship Darcon, and each has the guise of one of the races that inhabit the net worlds. Mortals fear to look upon them, but Hyleyn seeks them out, desperate to plead for her escape from Thalissar. She has also fallen in love with a Sinkha, the silver-haired Aker. Her wish is granted and she is shuttled to the Darcon, where she experiences virtual tableaux of beauty and peace, richly colored, clean and soothing. For the first time in her life she also hears quiet, finally away from the mysterious, maddening winds of Thalissar. Her newfound peace is shortlived however, as the Darcon moves to investigate unusual readings on the planet's surface and the incomprehensible crash of a Corporation ship at the source of these signals. Sinkha is a visually stunning work that braids multimedia features tightly with the graphic novel concept. It is baroquely detailed, lavishly textured and generously lathered with realistic animation and 3-D. The score is digital in flavor and the sound effects well chosen - the viscous lap of detritus-laden waters on metal, the drone of high powered winds and dynamos. Although visually complex, the actual story is muddled and hackneyed, degrades quickly and the characters have about as much emotional depth as sock puppets. However, this production is fabulous because the artistic and design elements are so strong (if a bit derivative of H.R. Giger).</desc>

Two of the players are playing against a single one but are not allowed to communicate. Each card has a value and one suit is called "Trumpf". In every round each player looses one of his card and the one which played the "Trumpf" card with the highest value gets all the played cards. If no "Trumpf" is played the highest value scores. At the end each player counts the values of his cards. The goal for the single player is to get more points than the other two combined.

The main feature of Skat 2010 is the integration of many local skat variants. If your favorite rule set is not included you can create it yourself with the freely adjustable rules. There is also a highscore list and speech.

In the shareware version you can't change the rule set and there are several small restrictions while playing.</desc>

It was then re-compiled for 32-bit Windows systems when the author found back the source code and released it for free through his website.Players control a skier on a downhill slope on a mountain. From the start, three types of courses can be selected, but these can also be ignored. In Slalom, the skier needs to pass flags on the right side and makes his way down to the finish. Tree Slalom is identical, but has a lot of trees on the course. The final one is Freestyle were points are scored by performing jumps and doing tricks in the air, followed by a safe landing.The skier can be steered using the keyboard or the mouse. It is also possible to jump, but the biggest ones are achieved with the help of rocks, bumps and rainbow-coloured pads. After the finish, the skier can move on until he is caught by the abominable snow monster. There are various obstacles, such as trees, snowboarders, rocks and more.</desc>

		<desc>Skull Cracker can be considered the spiritual successor to the 1991 title Creepy Castle that Bill Appleton wrote for Reactor Inc. The game is set in an alternate world where it is normal to see zombies and monsters roam the streets. They are kept under control by MEI (Mortality Enforcement, Inc.) - an organization that "helps the dead stay dead". As the monsters grow in number however, they organize themselves and demand civil rights. Since they are a common sight and fairly harmless, people do not worry about them, but a mysterious substance known as Goop changes the monsters' character drastically.

MEI brings in the freelancers Mortis "The Skullcracker" Rigor and Penelope "Bonebreaker" Jones to bring back order. Players can choose between one of the two characters, each with a distinct fighting style. With side-scrolling brawling gameplay, they need to travel through four main locations of four levels each. Some of the places visited are a shopping mall, an arcade, the graveyard, a playground, the MEI headquarters, and more. Next to moving, jumping, and climbing, they can punch and kick opponents, and use power-ups such as flare guns, flame throwers or supersoakers filled with holy water to take out enemies, while replenishing health with pick-ups.</desc>

		<desc>This graphics adventure game from Skybox (the well-known trading card company), came with three packs (18 cards total) of Skyborg trading cards. In the game, you are the Skyborg. The objective is to find and rescue Dr. Barton from his kidnapper(s) and escape. Along the way you will visit nine varied worlds, each of which has things needed to complete the game. While wandering around, you will encounter 95 characters in the form of cards, some of which are on walls or posters, many of the character cards are just standing around for you to walk up and acquire tools, knowledge, and weapons from them, a very unrealistic and unbelievable concept. There are several times in the game when you have to battle a "sentinel" (robot) in an action sequence (it's easy to die here). Overall, the graphics in Skyborg are not particularly outstanding, although some of the animations are actually quite good (the equipment repair/morphing sequence is pretty cool). Most of the graphics are static pictures with scattered hot-spots. There is quite a bit of text to read, which comes across as notes found or electronic messages received by Skyborg, these latter messages are printed on the screen in tiny letters and are difficult to read without getting close to the monitor. The audio has its moments, although the voice of Skyborg's nemesis, the evil Morb, comes across as very amateurish and grating, the original soundtrack and music is provided by the band Primal Future.</desc>

		<desc>Slay is a rather simple turn-based strategy game with a medieval theme. The game takes place on an island, which is a grid of hexagon tiles divided up between the 6 players. You must try to capture your enemies' territory, and the goal of the game is to conquer land and control the largest area. There are four types of troops, each stronger then the lesser ones. The weakest are the peasants (displayed as an unarmed man), spearmen (peasants with spear and shield), knights and the strongest are the barons (knight with spear and shield). The troops are upgraded by combining lesser troops. Some tiles contain resources or assets which the players can use to their advantage, like a castle, a cottage or trees.

The game covers many of the basic principles of war, such as the divide and conquer principle, the perils of multi front warfare, knowing when to attack and when to defend, finding the enemies weak spots and protect your own. It is also a game of resource management and risk assessment, for example, barons use up more resources from the territory.</desc>

		<desc>Puzzle game, third full game in the Smart Games Challenge series. This one includes 20 new and different puzzle types, each with between 30 and 50 individual puzzles (and 100 "Who What Where When" puzzles). Your score is tracked for every indivdual puzzle, so for puzzles with variable scoring, you can go back and try to do better (the game suggests what the maximum possible score is for every puzzle, but sometimes the developers can be beat).

Puzzles range from straightforward word puzzles ("Word Loops" and "SyllyBusters") to musical ("Stepping Tones") to trivia ("Who What Where When") to spatial manipulation puzzles ("Tumblin' Dice" and "Paradox Puzzle") to logic puzzles ("Take A Seat" and "Gumball" ) to math puzzles ("Shopping Cart") to variations on traditional games ("Poker Solitaire" and "Solocala," based on the traditional African game Mancala). Other puzzles are hybrids or just plain hard to classify: "Snake Pit," "Balloon Kaboom," "It's A Snap," "Butterflies," "Crossword Slide," "Paper, Scissors, Rock," "Word Flip," "Sheepdog," and "Meteor Mayhem."</desc>

		<desc>Imagine a high-tech attack on the United States... Imagine a unique story told in an unprecedented way. Developed by Xiphias, the company that introduced the first computer graphics system to be used in television news (KNXT in Los Angeles), Soft Kill is a unique techno-thriller based on the latest in hi-tech that explores the possibility of a world power using non-lethal warfare to bring the U.S. to its knees. Two politically opposed characters are thrown together in defense of the United States as a rogue element of the Japanese military attacks the Alaska Pipeline, the Panama Canal and the Malaccan Straits. The action explodes from a secret U.S. Navy base on Kauai to an ancient military shrine in Tokyo, from the North Shore of Alaska to the Palaces of Riayadh and the deep bowels of the United State's computer systems. Founded in a deep understanding of the vulnerability of the American infrastructure to attack and disruption, and the age-old attempts of governments to contest each other's territories of influence, this story combines high drama with photo-realistic imagery and video of secret places. The disk contains more than 70 digitized images and more than an hour of narration, which tell the story of what "nonlethal warfare" will be like in the not-so-distant future. Soft Kill owners can have the story told from different perspectives, including those of a narrator and the story's main characters. The innovative gameplay system consists of seven rows of ten cells each (called the Matrix), with four storytelling modes possible: Author (basic storytelling), Point-of-View (first-person views of varying subjects or subplots), Random (play sequences within each cell), and User (create your own path through the cells).</desc>

		<desc>Solitaire Twin Pack contains two card games, Pyramid Solitaire and Golf Solitaire.Pyramid Solitaire : In this game the cards are arranged in a pyramid and the object is to remove cards totalling 13 until all cards have been removed. In this game each card has a value starting with the Ace which counts as 1 through to the King which counts as 13. The object is to make 13 points i order to remove cards from play so at 13 points Kings can be removed as soon as they become available but Aces must be paired with Queens, 2's with Jacks, e.t.c. Each card removed will make available the card above it in the pyramid. When a player runs out of moves to make they may draw another card from the deck and try to use that card to form a match. The game concludes when all the cards have been removed from the pyramid or when no more moves are possible.Golf Solitaire : This may be played as a single hand or as a series of nine hands or holes in the game terminology.  The player starts each 'hole' with a score of 35 points, that's the number of cards that are on the table. One point is deducted for each card removed from the table. The object in each 'hole' is to clear all the cards from the table. The object of each game, as in a round of golf, is to finish with as low a score as possible. Card suits are irrelevant in this game. The player removes cards from the table by putting together sequences of cards starting with the card turned over. A sequence is made by playing a card from the table that is numerically one different from the card that's in play. Thus if a 5 were turned over the player could play any available 6 or any available 4 because these numbers are next in sequence. Once the 6 or 4 is played the turn continues until there are no more cards to be added to the sequence at which point the next card is turned over.		Both games are played with the mouse and come with in-game help text, and the ability to change the pattern on the back of the cards. Only Pyramid Solitaire has an Undo function and only Golf Solitaire has a Save Game option.</desc>

		<desc>Sonic's Schoolhouse is an educational game where the Sega mascot teaches mathematics, reading, and spelling. The game is entirely played from a first person perspective which allows the player to explore the schoolhouse and enter four different classrooms. There are two rooms for math, one for reading and one for spelling and each room has a total of ten questions which are written on chalkboards.

In the math rooms there are numerous numerals dancing around and the player has to pick up the right number and carry it to the chalkboard where said number is missing from the equation. The spelling room works the same but with letters that have to be matches with the unfinished words written on the chalkboards. The reading room contains balloons with pictures that has to be matched with the words written on the chalkboards. In each room the player has to avoid Dr. Robotnik who steals the answers when he gets close.

In addition to the classroom lessons there are two recess mini games that can be accessed in the backyard. These are made available by collecting recess power ups in the classrooms. The first one is a 3D version of concentration where the player uncovers question marks to reveal objects and the aim is to make matches of two of the same kind. The second is called ring hunt and simply involve collecting a certain number of rings without getting caught by any of Dr. Robotnik's henchmen. It is also possible to make field trips on a school bus. Aboard the bus are a number of animals and clicking on any of them allows the player to see videos that give information about the animals.</desc>

		<desc>Space Bastards is a Space Invaders clone with raytraced graphics, lots of weapon power-ups and a two player mode. You move your spaceship at the bottom of the screen, firing missiles while dodging shots from the endless waves of aliens.

The aliens move in a left to right pattern and speed up as their numbers decrease. Very slowly, the game gets more difficult as the aliens will return fire more and more. Every now and then, a UFO flies across the top of the screen, which drops a weapon power-up when you shoot it. Catch the power-up to temporary increase your fire power. A weapon bar will appear next to your score, and after a short time it will run out. After that you return to your default weapon, the slow firing missile which doesn't do that much damage.

There are lots of different power-ups weapons. The green slime blobs do the least damage but are still better than your default gun. The laser beam cuts through columns of aliens like butter. With the 3-way shot and 6-way shot you can spray the aliens like bugs. The grenades explode on impact taking out the surrounding aliens. Laser grenades also explode on impact but they then shoot two laser beams side ways, taking out an entire row of aliens. The flamethrower almost works like an eraser, simply move from left to right to wipe out the enemies. And finally, there's the nuke, a rare power-up that instantly kills all aliens on screen.</desc>

		<desc>Following his humorous adventures in previous game, Roger Wilco is relaxing at his favorite pub somewhere in time and space when heavily armed soldiers enter the room. Carrying a parting message from Roger's old nemesis, Sludge Vohaul, they plan to get rid of the janitorial hero, execution style. That is, until a man with an over-sized hair dryer helps Roger escape through a time rip into the future. Now Roger Wilco has woken up on his home planet, some time in a meta-fictional Space Quest XII. It is a grim, dystopian future: the series has gone to ruin without its hero, and Vohaul rules supreme. Roger must find a way to avoid Vohaul's henchmen, fulfill his destiny, and learn about a few surprises that await him in his own future.

Space Quest IV is the first in the Space Quest series to feature Sierra's icon-based SCI interface and 256-color graphics. The command set includes icons for walking, looking, using or taking, talking, smelling, tasting, as well as inventory access. Roger Wilco is shown on the screen from the exterior in multiple viewpoints.

		<desc>Space Sirens 2: Megababes from Ajia is an interactive adult title completely told from a first-person perspective. The many adult situations in this game feature nudity and graphic sex.  Set in a futuristic sci-fi world, the beginning of the game has the titular space sirens capturing the player's space craft.  After an arcade segment where the player fights off a wave of aliens, the space sirens appear and incapacitate the protagonist.  However, as he is a person of great respect and renowned, the space sirens are willing to spare his life if he is able to pleasure them sexually. Failure to do so means death.The game play consists of interactive movies where the player must make the correct choices in order for his particular space siren to achieve orgasm. Using what Pixis describes as a TFUI (Touch Feel User Interface) players can manipulate the NPC in various different ways.  Icons can be used in two different ways:  the hand can stroke and massage or be used to remove clothing,  the penis can be used in a standing position or a lying position.  Furthermore, the NPC can be turned around 180 degrees for complete visibility.  Touching a body part with the respective icon at the right time will play a movie that will raise the siren's pleasure meter,  when doing so at the wrong time the player will receive an admonition from the siren to slow down.  If at any time the player reaches climax before the siren the player will lose one of his three turns.</desc>

		<desc>Space, months and months of empty space. It stretches out behind you as you transport your cargo of beer and pretzels to Orion 7. Your faithful ship has seen better days but it gets the job done. You're contemplating some hot downtime at the red light spaceport when suddenly you realize you are not alone. You're a space privateer at the helm of your solo craft in search of rare alien artifacts. Responding to a distress signal, you are lured by the irresistible song of the sensuous Space Sirens emanating from a mysterious space station. You enter their domain only to realize that you've been entrapped in a VR chamber. Fulfill their every desire or remain a sex slave on the station forever. Your prime objective - search and fulfill. With advanced technology called Touch &amp; Feel User Interface (TFUI for short, pronounced tuh-foo-eee), users can interact with the Space Sirens by selecting an icon to represent an-ahem-"appendage," whether it be a hand or "other special interface tools." Each Siren is more difficult to please, so work hard and fast to peak their O-Meter without losing control of yourself, or it's end for you.</desc>

		<desc>Spelling Jungle (also known as Yobi's Basic Spelling Tricks) is an educational game with puzzle elements. The general objective of the game is to paddle a raft up a river, preventing it from flooding. The game consists of two main gameplay modes: solving a word-spelling puzzle on the "puzzle map", and participating in a simple spelling test. The objective of the puzzle map is to collect letter tiles by walking over them in the correct order, spelling a suggested word. The game consists of 101 such maps, gradually increasing in difficulty: the player will eventually have to avoid enemies (such as rhinoceroses and tigers), try not to fall into bottomless pits, and use various tools and vehicles to get to the desired letter. Completion of a puzzle map section leads to a spelling test phase, where the player is asked to spell various words. If the player spells the word correctly, his raft will slightly advance. After having spelled several words correctly, the player will be able to advance to the next level.</desc>

Choose from backgrounds such as the Kingpin's Headquarters or the Underground Subway Tunnel, then stamp in props to set the stage. Just click to hear Spider-Man himself to explain all the options. Pick a character to animate. Make Spider-Man leap from roof to roof. Should you pit Spidey against Venom? the Green Goblin? Kraven the Hunter? Spider-Man's trickiest villains are lying in wait. Who will win? You decide. Cool sounds explode from your speakers as the action unfolds. You can even use a microphone to narrate the story, and give the villains exciting dialogue. Build suspense with tunes from the Music Library and thrill your friends.</desc>

If you kill the beginning or the end of the Squirmer, you will shorten him. But if you kill a part from the mid, you will divide him into two Squirmers, and so on.The Squirmer moves from top left to top right, then moving a row down, then moving back to left. If a mushroom is in the way, he will change the row until he can move normally. You, however, can move your ship to any place inside the bottom halve of the playfield.The foes in the game (flea, spider, and scorpion) will hunt you, if they catch you, you have lost a life. This is also the case when the Squirmer got you.But the game also offers two friends. A butterfly, which will leave a cocoon some times. If you fire at this cocoon, it it explode and kill anything in range. The other friend is the snail, which sometimes is above a mushroom, shoot at this mushroom and he will give you some of his powers (Spread Gun, Laser, or Invincibility).</desc>

The player can view a sample story to get an idea of how his finished story might look, when he selects See How to Make a Story, Stanley will take him through all the steps. Once the player chooses Make a New Story, he is taken to the neighborhood map, where he can select from fifteen different backgrounds to use in his story, including a plain white background for those who want to include a lot of text.</desc>

		<desc>Star Merc is a single-player, first-person, space shooter from Diversions Software. The object of the game is to achieve a score high enough to be recorded on the high score table.

The player takes the role of a mercenary hired to keep the space lanes clear. This means dropping into sector after sector of space and destroying any ship that is present. The limitations are that the canon will overheat if overused and that each sector jump uses fuel which must be replenished by visiting a star base.

In combat there is the tactical scanner which looks like a red radar screen. This gives an indication of the position and number of enemy ships and, when combined with target direction indicators in the targeting window, help the player blast the bad guys.

The game is played out in the cockpit of the ship and is entirely mouse controlled. The mouse functions in two ways. In 'ship' mode moving the mouse steers the ship while the left mouse button fires the canon. The left mouse button toggles between this mode and 'cockpit' mode in which the player can select either the 'Eject' button to end the game or the 'NavTrack' screen in which the player selects the next sector to jump to.</desc>

Be ready to participate in this interactive adventure, so you can truly experience what it feels to be a Klingon. Klingon is basically a full-motion video click-your-own-adventure. At certain points in the game, you will be given a few seconds to make a decision on what to do. You perform action by clicking on the object onscreen, or do nothing (which is sometimes appropriate). Make the right choice, and the game continues. Make the wrong choice, and Gowron scolds you for not learning, and gives you another chance as the program was "rewound" back to that decision point. The game also comes packaged with a Klingon Language Lab, which helps to teach you about the Klingon language, complete with speech recognition to correct your Klingon pronunciation.</desc>

Hangman: Guess the letters in the word. Try not to make too many mistakes
Smart Dots: You and the computer take turns drawing a line between dots on a piece of paper. If you complete a square, fill it in, once the paper is filled, the player with the most squares wins.
Memory Blocks: A grid of tiles, turned face-down. Select the matching tiles.
Pick Up Sticks: Click on the sticks on top to pick them up. Try to pick up all of them in the least amount of time.
Code Breaker: Guess the secret code. Hints after every guess show the number of correct symbols.

		<desc>Take your Best Shot is a collection of Windows goodies and games based on the animations of Bill Plympton. The subtitle promises ôTwisted Arcade Games for Twisted Mindsö. In truth, the three games included are rather crude adaptations of Breakout, Pong and Baseball. The main attraction is an interactive version of the dispute between the two cartoon characters Joe and his Boss. Both humiliate each other with bizarre weaponry. For example, Joe blows his BossÆ head off with a cannon, his superior takes his revenge in working JoeÆs head with a lawnmower. You may choose the type of assault. Additional material on the CD includes a couple of uninspired ôflying headsö screensavers, nice desktop wallpapers and a collection of icons and sound samples.All of the animation in Take Your Best Shot is taken from the animated short film Push Comes To Shove (1991). The program contains no further, let alone new art. More information on Bill Plympton can be found in the trivia and links sections.</desc>

The stories all feature a strange Dr. Seuss like character called a zeep and the adventures he has in an equal strange world. I remember one story in particular in which the Zeep literally has butterflies in his stomach which gave him extraordinary abilities such as being able to sing really well. However, things start to fall apart when he's invited to actually sing on stage. It's a magical, fun-filled world of learning for children ages 5 to 10. Three richly animated, original stories of the Wild Zeep provide children with hours of entertainment. The Zeep is a good natured animal brought to life by your child's imagination. In addition, your child will learn valuable lessons about friendship, caring and perseverance. It includes an interactive glossary of words and definitions to help young readers expand their vocabulary and develops reading skills. An easy-to-use format helps children build computer skills.</desc>

A disaster task force called Team Xtreme is called to restore normal conditions to all places in Earth and fight the evil madman.Team Xtreme: Operation Weather Disaster is a educational point-and-click adventure similar to Myst, one of its many clones that came out at that time. A typical full-motion video game of the nineties, it features 360║ horizontal panning of some locations and easy puzzles for its target audience (mostly comprised of children).Published and produced by the computer game branch of the documentary channel Discovery, the focus is obviously on didactic elements: a small scientific facts database is integrated as a button to the interface, and can be accessed at any moment in the game. It plays animations and videos of hurricanes and other weather phenomena. It also contains clues to the solution of some of the puzzles. In an effort to further dispel any attempt at any meaningful amount of challenge, a hint button is provided on the interface at the bottom, placed between the inventory and the volume control and a compass.Gameplay is the standard fare of this type of game: instead of Myst's focus on mechanical puzzles, most are inventory-based. There are some short arcade sequences that need to be completed to advance the game.</desc>

You can take stones which are diagonally from your stone - if you are on a higher plain and it has the same or less size than your stone. One stone serves the same purpose than the king at chess: take him and you win the game.After paying the registration fee you get access to an editor, three enemy AIs, background art, other starting positions and the option to use a modem for multiplayer games.</desc>

		<desc>THiNK-X is a puzzle game in which you have to clear playing fields by matching identical objects in a limited amount of time. Items can be matched horizontally and vertically as doublets, or as triplets as long as three of a kind touch, but not diagonally. You have to plan carefully, as no objects are to remain at the end of the game. Items are moved by clicking them and assigning a new position on a horizontal line. If you make a mistake, you can rebuild the original lay-out, but time keeps running.

There are 168 levels divided over 28 playing fields with 6 difficulty modes. An increased difficulty is not only reflected in the amount of time, but also by different blocks and items with special features, making all the levels unique. There are toys in the Easy mode, numbers in Medium, letters in Hard and Extreme, coloured ducks in Funny, and in Tricky you play with vases that turn into blocks when matched.</desc>

		<desc>This CD-ROM program, designed for ages 5-10, has six activities designed to offer students experiences with a variety of thinking skills: memory, critical thinking, problem solving, and creativity.

The Create mode allows students to experiment, explore, and create, and in the Question and Answer mode students answer a character's questions.

In Oranga Banga students become familiar with the sounds of a variety of instruments, then Oranga Banga plays a pattern that the students try to repeat.

In BLOX - Flying Shapes students develop an awareness of spatial relationships, and the differences and similarities in shapes, by using geometric shapes, motion, and sound.

Feathered Friends teaches students visual discrimination, how to recognize, compare, and combine attributes, how to use parts to create a whole, how to complete patterns, how to recognize changes and attributes that create patterns, and how to hypothesize and test a rule.

In Toony Loon students improvise their own musical patterns and tunes on unique xylophones.

In the final activity, Fripple Shop, students are shown a variety of Fripples each with different attributes. Customers order fripples with specific attributes and the student must find them. Students may receive Fripple orders from customers by: clicking on the door (auditory and visual), clicking on a fax (visual only), or clicking the phone (auditory only). This Activity allows teachers and parents to observe how individual students learn.</desc>

BLOX lets the player learn about friction, motion, gravity, and inertia as they create inclines, grooves, and holes and send up to six balls through their paces.

Halftime Show has the player creating a halftime show program with various characters and commands.

Photo Twister has aliens that have altered a photograph and the player has to analyze the photo and line up the aliens that altered it. The player can also use the alien's tools to get creative and alter the photo.
The program also has a Grow Slide on Photo Twister, Stocktopus and Fripple Place so that the more correct answers the player gets in those activities, the harder the next one will be.</desc>

		<desc>In Thinkin' Things: Sky Island Mysteries, the player assumes the role of a detective paired with Joe Cluesteau of the Sky Isles who is tasked with solving various crimes that occur on the floating islands. There are 2125 inhabitants -- and thus suspects -- on the islands so it's important to gather clues. To do so, the player must participate in games related to basic logic and English phonetics. Aside from Clue Central, which is the detectives' home island, there are 3 other islands, each with a unique type of puzzle:   Rebus Isle: Solve rebus puzzles on this island, which are puzzles that involve forming words by adding and subtracting sounds based on various pictorial and animated clues given by the puzzle. For example, 'st' plus a picture of an earring leads to the word "steering". The game has a built-in spell checker/dictionary to help the player along with a hint system. Airshow Isle: Plan and coordinate an air show. Stadium Isle: Help Fripples (denizens of this particular island) find their seats in the stadium. There are particular rules that each Fripple must follow. For example, cheerleader Fripples only cheer if they sit in pairs. After working through enough puzzles and collecting enough clues, the player is able to use the clues to narrow down the suspects in the database.</desc>

		<desc>Titanic: Adventure Out of Time is an open-ended first-person adventure game set on the doomed maiden voyage of the HMS Titanic. The player takes the role of Frank Carlson, a disgraced British secret service agent. His career having ended after he failed in a mission on board the HMS Titanic, he now lives in a small apartment, surrounded by mementos of his past. Somehow, however, Carlson is thrown backward into his past to April of 1912, giving the player an opportunity to change the events on board the doomed ship. While the player is not able to avert the sinking of the Titanic, they are able to influence not only Frank's timeline but that of the other passengers on board the ship and, indeed, the progression of subsequent human history. As a result, details of the game's plot are affected by the player's actions, which can result in one of any number of significant or minutely different endings.The game is a puzzle-solving adventure game which utilizes a simple, point-and-click system in order for the player to interact with the world. While the game is played in the form of a traditional adventure game, it expands on this established system by constructing its game play around the idea of a continuous, transitory world. While the player still progresses through the game primarily through solving puzzles and interacting with other characters it presents these interactions as taking place within an active, malleable world. Characters, for instance, periodically move about the ship, and can be found in different portions of the ship during different times of day as they pursue their lives apart from the player. Puzzles are similarly tied to this progression of time, and players may choose to pursue plot lines how ever they think is best, influencing both the plot and other puzzles within the game, allowing them to completely overlook or pass over entire puzzles and story points. Early in the game, for instance, the player is asked to locate an item hidden by another character. If they're able to discover its location early enough, they can take the item from its hiding spot before someone else does. If they're sidetracked by other characters within the world, or in some other way too slow in locating the object, the hiding spot will be empty and the plot will accommodate this development. It is important to note, however, that the game does not progress in real-time as other adventures, such as The Last Express, do. Rather, time progresses due to the playe</desc>

		<desc>Tonka Joe and his animated pals guide children through a variety of construction projects using "real" Tonka brand trucks in this game from Hasbro Interactive.  There are rocks to crush, skyscrapers to build, and roads to pave spread throughout the five environments of Tonka Land.  Fourteen different virtual Tonka vehicles are available to accomplish these tasks and as projects are completed, the player earns printable certificates to show off their construction skills.  Ultimately, a child who completes all seven projects earns the title of "Master Builder" and the respect of the Tonka team.Although not overtly billed as educational software, Tonka Construction does emphasize learning how to follow a design plan and how to select the right tool (truck) to resolve a problem.  As a bonus, virtual 3D Tonka trucks are much safer than the sharp cornered metal Tonka toys responsible for so many childhood injuries in the 70s (although they aren't as much fun to use in the sandbox).</desc>

		<desc>This game is an expansive adventure, music video generator, and business sim all-in-one.  The storyline goes as follows: You've spent every last penny of your money buying an expensive music video production tower and having it blasted off into another dimension.  In order to complete the game you must earn enough money (minimum of $1 million) to blast your tower back home. To earn money you must make music videos. Dozens of songs and video clips are provided for you, and you must construct a "bonzai" video that one of three music TV producers would like and strike deals with them.  But sometimes the clips and songs given don't cut it, and you must venture out into the world and film different clips yourself.  Every once in a while you must have a duel to the death with a guitar monster. You also must recruit singers for your videos to improve your song quality, singers such as Johnny Fang and Edgar Death.  All in all its a very large game with weeks of playing time.</desc>

		<desc>Tower is a game whereby the player can become an air traffic controller. The main objective is to ensure the safe passage of landing and departing aircraft. All aircraft activity is reported to the text-based console and can be heard on the radio, awaiting player response. Communicate orders directly to the pilot from the tower console, warn of any dangers or tell them to use another runway (if available). Try to operate one of three airports or take on a whole scenario, which gradually progresses from a typical airport to O'Hare in Chicago, one of the busiest in the world. Each scenario offers flexibility to select a time of day, the number of runways and the rate of traffic with a maximum of 150 planes every two minutes.The main view outside of the tower is a total 3D 360-degree display. Switch to tracking or binoculars displays to closer watch planes. Several instruments help to make more informed decisions such as a compass, wind gauges, a clock, and a panel of shortcut buttons for quick and easy access to different functions from control over lights, arrival and departure details, bright display Airport Surface Detection Equipment (ASDE), and viewing angles.Points are earned for the ability to manage issuing commands, while they are lost for runway separations or crashes, the ultimate aim being to gain highly sought-after perks including the award for controller-of-the-month, time-off with pay or paycheck bonus.Multi-player games are possible over a modem or null-modem cable to owners of Microsoft Flight Simulator v5.1, enabling a pilot (second player) to come in to land at the player's airport.*Follows FAA and Transport Canada rules.</desc>

		<desc>The famous story of Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island contains pirates, buried treasures and high sea adventures. With narration and live video, children can interact with the characters and participate in the adventures. There's very little actual game afoot here - the entire story plays out in badly-animated CG clips of a talking skull, except when he's a live-action badly-synched talking skull. There's audio narration over still images and low-budget full motion video clips with the dialogue dubbed in later. In many of the live-action sequences, it appears that the acquired footage was damaged, or the script was changed, or (most likely) there just wasn't enough footage to cover the dialogue. So much of the story is told using still frames or repeated clips to support the post-dubbed dialogue. Oh, the drama! The low-budget production values! The cheesy video effects!</desc>

In order to find treasures and make your way up the mountain, you will need to help the elves solve a variety of math problems. When problems are successfully solved, the elves will then give you clues about treasures, some money which can be used to purchase items in the shops, or some items to help you reach the next level of the mountain. The math problems can include addition, subtraction, multiplication, telling time, counting money, and more. When you have located the treasures and brought them to the castle, you may then advance to a more difficult skill level.</desc>

The keys are hidden somewhere behind an object on each level of the mountain. To find out what is behind an object you need to use one of your magic coins. However, the number of coins you have is limited and there are many places to search so you first need to find clues as to where keys (and treasures!) are located. Wandering about the mountain are numerous elves, if you catch a scroll carrying elf in your net, he'll ask a question. A correct answer will provide a clue. After reaching the top of the multi-leveled mountain, all the treasures you collected along the way will be put back in the treasure chest, and you begin again at the bottom with a tougher difficulty level. After all treasures have been brought to the top, you can find the crown and win the game!</desc>

It uses photos, animations, videos &amp; voice clips to pose over 2000 questions and answers to Trivial Pursuit questions.In the Classic Game, up to 6 players roll an on-screen die and move their 'pie-dish' marker around the spoke-and-wheel game board, just like the board game.  The square you land on is color coded to one of six trivia categories:  People &amp; Places, Sports &amp; Leisure, History, Arts &amp; Entertainment, Science &amp; Nature, and Wild Card.  Answering the trivia question correctly lets you take another turn.Further, if you are on the 'prize' square at the end of each spoke (1 spoke end for each category color), the correct answer grants you a colored pie piece in your pie-dish marker for that category.  Once you have all 6 pie pieces in your dish, you need to head back to the hub for a final random question to win the game.In the Fast Game, up to 6 players can forgo the die-rolling and board movement.  It's a race to answer correctly a question from each category first!  Categories are randomly selected in this mode.</desc>

		<desc>One day Ariel, an ordinary schoolgirl, is left after the classes by her biology teacher. The teacher, a pervert, as every girl in the school seems to know, seduces Ariel. While he does it, he is transformed into the Overlord, a creature who seduces and tortures girls and young women. As Ariel reaches her climax a portal opens dragging her 900 years into the future. There she learns of Overlord's time portals, through which he has set up a series of erotic torture dens for young girls across time and space.  Ariel now becomes an Ultra Vixen and she decides to use her Superclimax power to disrupt the continuum and seal Overlord's temporal access. To do so Ariel will have to channel herself into the minds of sexually tortured victims and reach the climax. The game is divided into 3 levels: WWII Germany, present time Tokyo subway train and distant future. Each level is divided into several stages, the goal of each stage is to get Ariel's sexual excitement to the maximum using various tools at hand. Using right tools will add some points to the score and move the story forward, while using tools that Ariel currently dislikes may deduct the points from the score and ultimately bring the game to Game Over. Most actions are done by selecting a tool and rapidly moving it back and forth for some time. The heroine and the tools are in 3D.</desc>

The Train Game echoes the chase in "The Wrong Trousers" and you have to lay tracks across the kitchen so that Gromit can ride the toy train all the way to the sink.</desc>

Unlike most 4X games, though, it is a "beer-and-pretzels" game, designed with a short-but-adjustable time limit (the default is 30 minutes).</desc>

The game features 16 bit stereo, surround music and sound effects, and graphic art  (full screen 3D).

It is up to the player to collect evidence and solve the crime.The third installment of the Virtual Murder series (now renamed Murder Mystery) follows the same overall design of the other games. The player has six hours to solve the murder, and time diminishes with each action executed (interviewing suspects, examining items on the crime scene), with the exception of a brief case summation that can be played without any time decrease.After gathering enough evidence (stored automatically in the notebook area), the player can call a press conference and answer questions about the case. If this questionnaire is filled correctly, the game moves to its second level, where the player must present the case to the judge.On the previous iterations, the murderer was selected randomly by the computer out of three possible choices. This time, the player can select directly one of the three game paths at the beginning of the game. Each has small alterations and different clues, although the setting remains the same.</desc>

		<desc>Sam Rupert has been found dead in the resturant he owns. The police detectives arrive at the scene and must gather clues and solve the mystery to find out which one of 8 suspects might have killed Sam Rupert. Furthermore, since "most" crimes are solved within 6 hours, the city is demanding this case be wrapped up within that limit.Who Killed Sam Rupert is a multimedia full-motion-video detective game. Players assume the role of the investigating detective and must search the area, and zoom in, via a 1st person adventure game interface for clues and interview witnesses. Each action eats up a designated amount of time, and after 6 hours, the case is over and the player must explain what they've found at a press conference in order to get a chance at arresting the guilty party from a narrowed down list of 3 suspects. There are three possible "motives" for the case and thus three possible endings in solving the murder of Sam Rupert.</desc>

The player has 6 hours to solve the murder, and time diminishes with each action executed (interviewing suspects, examining items on the crime scene), with the exception of a brief case summation that can be played without any time decrease.After gathering enough evidence (stored automatically in the notebook area), the player can call a press conference and answer questions about the case. If this questionnaire is filled correctly, the game moves to its second level, where the player must present the case to the judge.There are three possible solutions to the crime. The player can select directly one of the three game paths at the beginning of the game. Each has small alterations and different clues, although the setting remains the same.</desc>

		<desc>Widget Workshop is a "software toy" designed for children. The game is intended to teach children the principles of science, and encourage them to apply their creativity to invent their own devices. In the game, the player selects different components that perform certain functions (such as an input device, a power switch, a randomizer, a logic operator, or an output display) and links them together to form a "widget". Widgets can be made for many purposes, such as a puzzle, a calculator, a game, a logic gate, or a Rube Goldberg contraption. The game is open-ended, although it does come with a set of pre-made widgets and a book of challenges.</desc>

		<desc>Crowther and Woods' trailblazing treasure-hunting cave-exploring text adventure game ADVENTURE is here presented in a new form.  Compiled from early FORTRAN and C sources, this port makes use of its early GUI by presenting a text output window, through which the game communicates to the player, as well as a player input window with buttons to streamline common commands (typically directional in nature) and a text entry box for more esoteric words (such as, for instance, "xyzzy".)  The story and plot, such as it is (grab the treasures, try not to die) is much the same as other ports from its primeval source.  This version, as do many, offers 350 points to be amassed through player action and treasure collection.</desc>

		<desc>WinBlocker is a shareware falling block puzzle game.

The game is played via the keyboard or joystick and has a different block set to most other falling block puzzles. The player controls a brick firing cannon. The falling shapes must be formed into solid rectangles by the addition of these bricks.

This game is not about shooting blocks and blowing things up it's about strategically adding bricks to the shapes as they fall to form larger, rectangular shapes and thus generate more points. For example overlapping blocks can, if completed in the right order, be cleared as a single unit.

Once a block has been completed it disappears and the player's score increases. If any block hits the ground it's game over.</desc>

		<desc>WinRoids is a shareware Asteroids clone where you have to destroy every asteroid on the level while avoiding being hit by the debris (asteroids get split into smaller parts when hit) and the occasional flying saucers. The game uses newtonian physics which means that you use your thrusters to accelerate in a direction, and the ship keeps moving in that direction and velocity - regardless of the current direction your ship is pointing - until you use your thrusters again to decelerate or change your direction.The levels are on a single screen with looped borders. Anything that exits the screen on one side,  will enter the screen on the other. This includes your own shots. Apart from the random enemy UFOs, there are also randomly appearing bonus crates containing extra lives, weapon upgrades and shield generators. The graphics are high resolution (for 1994) pre-rendered 2D sprites in cartoon or 50's sci-fi style.</desc>

		<desc>An enemy armada is invading the United Federation of Planets and Starfleet Command estimates that Earth will be attacked in about a month. So the player, controlling James T. Kirk, commander of the original NCC-1701 Enterprise, is ordered to stop that invasion.WinTrek is Star Trek simulation game, where the player virtually controls every aspect of the Enterprise, including those that would normally be done by the crew.For navigating the Enterprise through the sectors and quadrants, the player does not "drive" her, but instead controls the navigation station directly (setting course, whereby any of the 360 degrees can be used, and setting speed limits, both impulse and warp). During combat, the player has to manage shields, coordinate phaser fire and photon torpedoes, including the control of how much dilithium (fuel) is invested into shields and weapons. Finally, the player must manage the dilithium fuel (i.e. refilling at starbases) and make sure that the ship doesn't break apart (damage system).The game is won when the enemy armada is destroyed, and lost when the armada attacks Earth, or when the player-controlled ship runs out of fuel or explodes. Both the number of enemy ships and the days available to the player are randomly set when the game is started. The game offers six difficulty levels, ranging from Admiral (expert) to Expandable Crewman (easiest). In-game Computer Station acts like a computer operation system, allowing the player to get information not visible at the other stations (e.g. retrieve the position of the starbases). Information is displayed in 11 sub-windows of the game window, which are all re-sizable and movable.</desc>

		<desc>The World Empire series moved to Windows in the second game of the series. It's a game of global domination, like Risk, except that there are no cards to award bonus armies. Each player represents an ideology – Populist, Militarist, Socialist or Realist. The world is divided into 139 nations, each of which supports one of the players' ideologies. When you conquer a nation that supports your ideology, they greet you as liberators and require only 1 army to hold them, whereas nations that support rival ideologies need additional armies to remain in order to prevent a revolution. Armies are awarded at the beginning of each turn based on the number of nations held, plus bonus armies for holding an entire continent. World Empire II adds an "all nations conquered" option, in addition to the "all nations neutral" starting position of the original. Populations and national capitals are now listed for each country. Starting with v1.5, the game became "Deluxe" because it adds a real world simulation mode to the registered version, in which population and development are taken into account. Version 1.5 also adds an option to have all sides start with 30 armies instead of 56, and to check the status of all countries on the continent. The shareware version can be played by one to four players, with up to two computer players (one in v1.0). The registered version can be played against up to seven computer opponents, and adds three new ideologies.</desc>

Nations with the same ideology as yours will be easier to conquer and occupy, while nations with different ideologies will put up greater resistance. Ideological factions include the Populists, Militarists, Socialists, Realists, Pacifists, Optimists, Pessimists, and Feminists.There are two modes of play: Standard and Real World Simulation. The Standard game plays out similarly to Risk. Real World Simulation mode adds a number of details, including population, industrial/agricultural/gasoline production, infantry/mechanized/tactical air support, and less randomness in battle resolutions.</desc>

However, following the Darkfall, the jagtera have disappeared from the island. The quality of life on Phoros has drastically declined, and its nobles came up with a monstrous plan: spreading rumors about the return of jagtera, they poisoned the population with a nectar that turned them into vicious, uncontrollable replicas of these gentle creatures. When a wandering squire named Warrick arrives on Phoros, searching for his missing sister, he realizes that something must be done to stop the pestilence. He does not known that he may have to leave his humanity by the wayside and succumb to the plague himself...Entomoprh is the second computer game set in the fictional world of Aden, the first being Thunderscape. Though the two games share the same setting, their gameplay styles are quite different. Entomoprh is predominantly an action game with very light role-playing and puzzle-solving elements. The squire explores the island, talks to inhabitants, gathers clues and necessary items, and ventures into hostile areas to fight enemies. Combat is action-oriented and is done either with physical attacks or spells. There are no weapons in the game: Warrick either fights using his fists or morphs into different creatures by drinking special potions, thus acquiring new attacks. There are no character statistics or experience system of any kind.The monster-morphing comes with a prize: Warrick is slowly turning into a jagtera. The player may control his actions and decisions throughout the game, ultimately affecting the ending, which determines whether the hero has resisted a complete transformation or not.</desc>

		<desc>Yearn2Learn: Master Snoopy's World Geography is a game that attempts to teach children about geography.There are two separate lessons in this game. The first teaches children about the stares of the USA, where they are and what their names are. The second teaches children about other countries in the world and where they are located.The 'Geography Puzzle Game' is the game that teaches the US states. It has two modes of play, easy and hard. Both modes of play break the states of mainland USA (i.e. not including Alaska &amp; Hawaii) into four zones. The player selects a zone and is presented with a sliding tile type of puzzle in which the tiles are in the shape of the states in the selected zone. In the easy mode all the player has to do is place the tile into its correct position and the game will display and speak the state's name. When all states have been positioned correctly Snoopy walks on screen waving the US flag and music plays. In the hard mode the player again places the state in its correct position, upon which the game displays a list of all the states in the zone, so that the player can choose the correct name for the state that has just been placed. The Great Country Shoot game takes place in a circus in front of a globe and is a 1 or 2 player game. The player is asked to help one of the Snoopy characters find a country. The player jumps into a cannon, the globe spins, the player clicks on a region with their mouse and the character is fired from the cannon to parachute down to the selected location. If the player has selected the correct location the player gets a message of congratulation and is shown the character standing in the designated country.The gameplay changes depending upon the level that has been achieved by the player(s). In level 1 when the player is asked to locate a country the correct region of globe flashes red/green before the globe spins so that all the player must do is click on that region as it comes into view. In level 2 the player proceeds as in level 1 but when the region has been selected correctly the player must then select the correct country from the regional map. Level 3 is the same as level 2 but with a wider range of countries. Levels 4 to 7 have progressively more obscure countries to find and give no hints as to which region of the globe they are in. There are ten questions per level and at the end of the level the player is given their score.</desc>

		<desc>Inspired by the Oz Books by L. Frank Baum, Yellow Brick Road concerns the player's attempt to thwart an invasion of the Emerald City by the Gnome King. Along the way s/he teams up with the tin man, lion, and eventually the scarecrow. Besides these, other recognizable figures from the books include Jack Pumpkinhead, the little Wizard of Oz, and Glinda, who, in the game, is queen of Oz. The game's structure is reminiscent of first-person adventures: the player interacts with the environment and manipulates inventory items to proceed. The puzzles, however, are kept to a minimum, since combat occupies a significant portion of the game, effectively turning it into a hybrid of adventure and small-scale real-time strategy.cmdtles usually occur as dictated by the plot. The player does not fight directly, but instead acts as a general to his/her companions. Each character has a quick but weak base attack or can use one of the items found throughout the game. Many of the items act differently depending on who uses them. For instance, the flute calls field mice into battle for the Tin Woodman, while it calls crows into battle for the Scarecrow.  The more powerful the item, the longer the downtime for the character who has used it before he can fight again. The enemies progress toward the companions' side of the battlefield at a constant pace.  If they reach them, the battle is lost, and the player must try again.  If instead the player manages to push them back off the far side of the field, the battle is won and the game progresses. Different enemies are more greatly affected by different weapon/character combinations, and immune against some.</desc>

Many questions are humorously structured, drawing inspiration from pop culture references.

So begins not only one of the great adventure classics by Jules Verne, the "Father of Science Fiction", but also a truly fantastic voyage from the lost city of Atlantis to the South Pole. The disc features dramatic narration, word definitions, animation, music, sound effects and a reading comprehension quiz.

		<desc>Some would call it Impossible Pinball.  Not that it is difficult to play, rather that you could never build a pinball machine that could do the type of things that this game does.  But it seems as though that's the point.  As like any pinball game, there is an underlying plot in which you must achieve certain goals on each of the three pinball tables (you can warp between them).This takes you off into the fantasy pinball world, where anything can happen.  Tanks can attack your ball, comets can fly in and create a crater in the middle of the board.  Who knows what will happen next.</desc>

		<name>3D Atlas '98</name>
		<desc>3D Atlas is an educational title which boasts 3D graphics on twelve different types of spinning globes, time lapse video sequences animations showing changes to the planer such as the destruction of the ozone layer and more.

This version includes what is described as 'a challenging quiz' called 'Around The World' which can be played by one to three players. In their turn each player faces a round of five questions. Each question is timed and is worth a certain amount of points or air-miles, but that value decreases over time. When a round has been completed the game shows a humorous video of some form of transport, usually early aircraft. When all players have completed their round the game shoes a representation of the earth and how far the players have traveled with their accumulated air miles.

Questions are obviously based on geography and countries of the world. Identifying a natoins flag is a common kind of question as is recognising a country from a picture of its scenery or a local market, knowledge of capital cities and major exports helps too.

The quiz ends when a player has made a complete circuit of the earth. The scoreboard does not show high scores because a trip around the earth is always the same distance, instead it shows the percentage of questions answered correctly.</desc>

The game can be played against another human, or the computer with several difficulty levels. The initial position of the marbles can be switched between four configurations.</desc>

Travel from Alaska via the magic land Vulcania to Bavaria in this comic adventure, that also contains some action elements.The game resembles Leisure Suit Larry in the way it treats adult material: there's no explicit nudity or pornographic scenes, but the dialogues, the jokes, the actions and the thoughts of the animal-loving hero go certainly in this direction.The interface in the game is very simple. You make Ace walk around by clicking on the screen, and tell him to interact with objects by clicking on them. At any time, Ace can access his watch, where settings can be changed and the game saved. Some puzzles are classic "use item on item" adventure fare, but there are lots of action mini-games.</desc>

It also regards the technical evolutions during the war, which means you have different types of planes at your disposal as the game progresses. After you have chosen the right pilots it's time to intercept, attack enemies or defend your own allies.The game is turn based but you have limited autonomy each time you play according to your plane's speed and torque.</desc>

The puzzle types are very varied, from simple mini-games to more thinking oriented puzzles. As in every point-and-click adventure game you have your inventory, essential to solve the puzzles, though there aren't different cursors for different actions.</desc>

Following the original, new editions were introduced including More After Dark and Before Dark, as well as editions themed around licensed properties such as Star Trek, The Simpsons, Looney Tunes and Walt Disney Company characters.[2] The screensaver modules were often noted for their intertextuality, such as the flying toasters appearing in the Fish screensaver, and the cat from Boris screensaver appearing in the Bad Dog screensaver.

As well as the included animated screensavers, it allowed the development and use of third-party modules, of which many hundreds were created by the height of After Dark's popularity</desc>

		<name>Air Havoc Controller</name>
		<desc>Essentially an airport traffic control tower simulator. Your mission here is to manage the aircrafts in Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport's airspace from the control tower. There is no "winning" in this game, you play rounds of varying difficulty in which you must direct planes through waypoints, clear planes for takeoff, change altitude, etc. without them crashing or colliding in mid-air. You can select your difficulty from a series of pre-defined options or make your custom rounds by selecting parameters such as numbers of planes, time available, etc.The game screen is divided in two, with the upper half being your view from the tower, and where animations for different events happen (crashes, etc.) and the lower half the being the main game interface where you have your radar and communications interfaces.In addition to the main game, the CD includes a series of complementary materials regarding planes and other reference info.</desc>

		<desc>As the game title implies, Al Unser, Jr. Arcade Racing is an action oriented racing game. While the game is set in the IndyCar racing league, not all 15 courses feature the trademark oval design, some of them are with curves and chicanes.The game is designed for quick and easy experience, which means the only diversion from pushing the gas pedal is using the manual gear shifting - and this can be deactivated. There are overall three playing modes (plus multiplayer): practice, a championship with all 15 courses and a checkpoint race on any course.</desc>

		<path>./Alice - Interactive Museum.pc</path>
		<name>Alice: An Interactive Museum</name>
		<desc>The player searches through a museum of twelve rooms for a deck of 53 cards, upon which are clues which will lead to the last room and the end game. Those cards are hidden among artwork inspired by Lewis Carroll's Alice novels - to find them the player has to solve puzzles of varying complexity. The art is very interactive, but those hot spots are not marked when touching them with the mouse. Finding them might result in bizarre results like turning the room upside-down. This game knows no save feature and doesn't track how many cards are found. The player needs to write down the clues he already found until he can puzzle together how to find the exit.</desc>

		<name>Alien Arcade</name>
		<desc>Alien Arcade is a full-screen desktop games collection aimed at younger players. The games are all controlled with the mouse, and all have the same theme of aliens and outer space. The graphics are colorful and cartoony, and the arcade action is designed to be non-violent and kid-friendly. Each game has its own highscore table.

Ctrl-P is used to pause a game, Ctrl-A to stop playing the current game and choose another one to play, and Ctrl-Q to quit Alien Arcade altogether. The games run at 640x480 pixel resolution, but only a 512x342 pixel region of the screen is used for the games. Outside this is a static border featuring background art (such as the surface of a planet, or the inside of a spaceship) which changes randomly each time you play.

There are six games in the collection.
Andromedroids: in this game you build up robots one piece at a time, by dropping them into one of seven assembly bins. There is also a recycle bin for dropping unused parts, and a special bug bin for dropping Mercurian Metal Bugs that may appear. Dropping the bugs in any other bin will cause damage to your robot parts.

Fungus Patrol: you control a ship in the middle of the screen that can only rotate, but if you click the mouse, the ship shoots out in a straight line on a bungee cord, touches the edge of the screen, then snaps back to the center. Green fungus encroaches in on you from the edges of the screen, and you clear it up by hitting it with your ship, which has a big suction nozzle on the front of it. The fungus can damage your bungee cord, and if it is completely eaten away, the game is over.

Nerdoids: you control a ship at the bottom of the screen that can only move left and right, and shoots comic books. Moving across the screen, on multiple levels, are orange aliens wearing glasses. If you hit an alien with a comic book, they will start reading it. If you hit an alien already reading a comic book with another comic book, they drop the one they are holding. The aim is to have all aliens still be reading a comic book when they leave the screen. The aliens will also randomly drop calculators and pocket protectors, that can subtract 5 comic books from your arsenal if they hit you.

Quasar Klutzes: you control a ship at the bottom of the screen that can only move left and right, and shoots bananas. There are blue aliens walking back and forth on multiple levels. The aliens are clumsy and will either slip on bananas, or two aliens may collide trying to grab the same ban</desc>
