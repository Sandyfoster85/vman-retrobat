		<desc>Get ready to suspend reality and be brought into a world of floating islands where personal robots are a necessity and pirates and vicious monsters roam the skies. You'll see many dogs and cats along the way, but don't expect your furry friends to be on all fours – they're anthropomorphs. With his cigarette-like bone sticking out of his mouth, Red Savarin, an overconfident teenager, and his specialized robot Dahak have made a name for themselves by taking on odd jobs. Red's curiosity gets the best of him when he comes across a mysterious medallion. Ruh-oh, strange artifacts? This can't be going anywhere good. But before Red runs off with the medallion, he comes across Elh, a sullen, enigmatic creature who shares an unknown link with the medallion for Red to uncover.</desc>

		<name>I Spy Fun House</name>
		<desc>I Spy Fun House is another digital adaptation of the long-running series of children's books by Walter Wick, this time with an amusement park theme. The objective is to find and click on all the objects described in a verse at the bottom, on screens depicting locations and attractions of the park. The objects move or display a little animation after being clicked to indicate the correct selection. After all the required items are found, the verse is replaced with a final clue to a hidden ticket.

The tickets unlock new areas and mini-games. Eleven tickets are necessary to enter the Fun House area, while extra tickets open the mini-games. These bonus games are implementations of classic concepts, where the player has to match tiles by swapping pairs on concentric circles, fit tetrominoes shapes inside the limited space of a box, click on the differences between several similar pictures and other challenges. There are no hints or hint button available to show the location of the objects, and no time limit or penalty for wrong clicks.

The Windows/Macintosh CD-ROM release includes a 3-inch promotional mini-disc, containing one riddle from each of three earlier I Spy games: I Spy Fantasy, I Spy Spooky Mansion Deluxe, and I Spy Treasure Hunt.</desc>

		<name>Madagascar Kartz</name>
		<desc>Madagascar Kartz is a racing game based on DreamWorks Animation's Madagascar. It was released on October 27, 2009 and the second game on Madagascar's spin-off series.

Gameplay[edit]
The game is a basic kart racing game, and the player can perform jumps, flips, rolls.[1] There are many different stages from scenes of the franchise.[1] Playable characters include Alex, Marty, Gloria, Melman, King Julien, Mason and Phil, or all four of the penguins.[1] The Madagascar Kartz Wheel is bundled with the Wii version of the game. This wheel is optional. This wheel's look is different from that of the Wii Wheel from Mario Kart Wii.[1]

Playable characters include Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Melman the Giraffe, Gloria the Hippotamus, The Penguins, The Chimps, and King Julien from the Madagascar. Two characters from other movies are included alongside the Madagascar, Shrek from Shrek, and B.O.B. from Monsters vs. Aliens, all DreamWorks Animation franchises. Race types include Quick Race, Championship, Time Trial and Checkpoint race. A Championship race is one where the player collects mangoes and tries to finish first place in order to unlock higher speed classes (50cc, 100cc, 150cc, 200cc, the last one is raced in reverse direction/mirror mode), more karts and tracks. In Time Trial, players beat their own times and earn medals (gold, silver and bronze). In Checkpoint Race, players collect as many hourglasses as they can before the time runs out. There are several tracks in the game. Also, in a track, most tracks have 2 shortcuts. "I Like to Move It", sung by Reel 2 Real, is the menu theme. The game's gameplay is similar to those of Mario Kart Wii, by Nintendo. The sequel is Super Star Kartz.</desc>

		<desc>After arriving at the Animal Village, you try desperately to fit in and make friends.  After almost succeeding, a boxing gym opens and all the animals join up.  Looks like you'll have to take part, too.  Get ready to box!

Animal Boxing is a game that requires you to hold the Nintendo DS upside down to play.  The player uses the touch screen to punch in a variety of ways - tapping your opponent throws a standard punch, swiping horizontally throws a hook, and swiping upwards throws an uppercut.  By holding the stylus on-screen longer, you can charge power for a more powerful punch.  The Control Pad is used to dodge left and right, as well as block.

As your boxer takes and delivers hits, their Anger Meter increases.  When it is at its maximum, your boxer fills with rage, and all of their attacks become more powerful for a limited time.  This can be used to turn the tide in a match.  However, opponents can also use this tactic, meaning that blocking and dodging become very important during these moments!

As with other boxing games, your goal is to defeat your opponents in a series of bouts to win the championship belts.  Once you defeat the champion, you'll win the belt and progress to the next championship.  Each championship you win unlocks new animals to fight against in the Vs. Animal matches, as well as new items to decorate your boxer with.</desc>

Bionicle Heroes DS is a classic first-person shooter. As a nameless Matoran, you'll travel across 25 themed levels (including jungles, lava-worlds, ancient underground temples) discovering new weapons and new robotic foes to blast apart. Along the way, you'll use the masks' powers to survive the hostile environments as well as collect gears and robot parts to solve simple puzzles by assembling LEGO-style ramps, bridges, and doorways.

The levels in the game are populated by a large visual variety of Bionicle-inspired bad guys, including ones that transform, fly, roll, or charge at you with scorpion-like stingers. Fortunately, you'll be able to upgrade your weapons and destroy them with plasma blasts, lightning, and sniper lasers.

The game also contains a robust local multiplayer mode that allows up to 4-players to compete in deathmatches in arenas laden with weapon and mask upgrades.</desc>

		<name>Burnout Legends</name>
		<desc>First installation of the Burnout-series on handheld consoles combines the best features of the first three games: Burnout, Burnout 2: Point of Impact, and Burnout 3: Takedown.  Aggressive racing is still the centerpiece attraction of Burnout Legends and the player's task is not only to win the races but also crash opponent cars as much as possible.  Opponent takedowns, drifts, and other stunts award Burnout Points which in turn unlock new cars and other awards.

One player games can be played as single events or as a World Tour where the player needs to compete in different races and succeed in them in order to advance through five car classes (Compact, Muscle, Coupe, Sport, and Super).  In addition there is the Crash mode, where the goal is to create as much wreckage as possible by ploughing the player car into the traffic.  The different race types include Race, Time Attack, Road Rage, Pursuit, Face Off, Eliminator, Burning Lap, and Grand Prix.  Multiplayer game modes include Race, Road Rage, Pursuit, special Crash modes Double Impact and Party Crash (all these can can be played as single events or as a tournament), and Collector Challenge where the player has the opportunity to win other player's Collector cars.

PSP version game sharing feature allows others to play multiplayer events or single player demo without their own Burnout Legends UMD.

DS version Multi-Pak support allows two player games without additional game cards.  More than two player games require multiple game cards.</desc>

		<name>Cake Mania</name>
		<desc>Jill is a young baker who acquired her passion for baking from her grandparents in their bakery, Evans Bakery.  When she returned from culinary school, she discovered Evans Bakery closed down because a "Mega-Mart" moved in.  Jill decides to show the mega corporation what her family's baking is all about and opened her own bakery in order to earn enough money to buy back Evans Bakery. Can Jill handle the pressure of running her own business and beat Mega-Mart?

In Cake Mania, your job is to help Jill meet the monthly quota through 48 progressively difficult levels. This is no simple task because you will have to bake quickly as well as serve the customers quickly.  

There are a variety of different customers to serve.  From nice old ladies to impatient holiday icons like Cupid! Each kind of customer have a different patience-level (indicated by the number of hearts).  The longer they wait, the lower their patience.  If they get too low, they will storm off and cost you money!

When a customer first enters your bakery, hand them a menu. Then they will give you their order (in the form of a thought bubble) and you will have to create that cake.  If you create the wrong cake (wrong shape or wrong frosting, etc) then you will have to throw it away and start over (costing you more money). You start off with one oven and one frosting machine.  Between levels you will have the opportunity to purchase upgrades or new items that will improve the bakery's.  For example, you can purchase upgrade your oven to one that bakes faster or you can purchase a T.V. that will help improve customers' patience.</desc>

		<desc>Revive the classic shooting game with your Nintendo DS and use your Stylus as your gun to hunt the chickens that you see in the screen or complete the puzzles and reach the highest score under a time limit. The game features different game modes:

Classic mode: Hunt as many chickens as you can in a single stage to reach the highest score under a time limit. It's essentially the classic chicken shoot.

Weight mode: In weight mode chickens approach by air. Move side to side and fire your hefty cannon to the right chicken depending of the color of your weight (your bullet). Three weights of the same color to the same chicken and you've done your main objective.

Gems mode: Here you cannot move side to side. You must shoot the chickens to make them release a gem where three metallic containers reside. Line up the gems to get extra points just like the classic Columns game.

Hotwire mode: A kind of racing game in which you control your car with your stylus. Your job is to drag your car left or right to avoid hitting the side of the track. Every time that you finish the track the speed is increased.

Spot the difference mode: Use Nintendo DS dual screen you'll have to find the differences between two images. The right picture is in the upper screen and you'll have to tap the differences in the touch screen with your stylus.</desc>

		<path>./Deep Labyrinth (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Deep Labyrinth</name>
		<desc>Deep Labyrinth is a slow-paced first person dungeon exploration game for Nintendo DS.
The movement is controlled with D-pad, while all of the game’s attacks are executed through touch-screen. Deep Labyrinth’s magic system requires the player to draw symbols – Kirie on a 3x3 grid, in order to cast spells. As the game progresses, the Kirie become more and more complex, eventually requiring strings of up to 9 unique symbols.

The game is split into two chapters different enough to be separate games.

In the first chapter tells the story of a boy named Shawn, whose family is stranded on the roadside by a blown tire. His parents go off to find help, but mysteriously vanish. As it’s getting late, and a storm is approaching Shawn and the family pet – dog named Ace, seek shelter in an apparently abandoned mansion close by, but as they do, both are transported into a bizarre fantasy world. Apparently, this world is a place where unneeded human memories are sent do be erased, and as we find out – Shawn’s parents’ memories of him and each other are scheduled for deletion. This sets our hero on a quest to save his family and, perhaps discover the dark secrets of the world of memories.

The second chapter casts you as a hero mysteriously transported into an unnamed dungeon, where he soon discovers a girl trapped in a crystal. The hero has a vague recollection of once knowing the girl, but it is suggested that she died long ago. From that point on the game becomes about escaping the dungeon and saving the girl.

The two chapters are different enough to be separate games. Chapter one is fleshed out with NPCs, dialogue, and story event cutscenes, as well as a several lengthy anime FMVs, while the second chapter is much darker, and features very little in terms of story, focusing on the combat instead.</desc>

		<path>./Elements of Destruction (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Elements Of Destruction</name>
		<desc>In Elements of Destruction the player can unleash the most volatile forces on Earth such as tornadoes, lightning storms, ice storms, earthquakes and meteor storms, wreaking havoc on unsuspecting cities and causing massive amounts of damage and creating complete and utter chaos.

The story tells of a TV weatherman by the name of Marty Storm  who is fired from his job for reporting the truth about bad weather conditions instead of lying about good weather conditions in which the station's producer hopes will result in better ratings.  Afterwards he vows revenge as his former co-workers ridicule him, unknown to them however, Marty Storm is also a part-time mad scientist that has created a device that can create disasters at will.  With this device, Storm goes on a quest to bring the city and his former co-workers to their knees.  The gameplay is divided into three weeks (levels) which have seven days, each with their own set of goals.  Some consist of causing a set amount of damage, others consist of destroying a certain percentage of building while others consist of destroying certain buildings.  These objectives must be done within a certain time limit.

To conjure these storms a menu is on the right side of the bottom screen which has a list of disasters available (some are only available on certain days).  After selecting their disaster they use the stylus pen to create a path of destruction for the tornadoes and storms or pick a certain point for either the earthquake or meteors.  For the storms and tornadoes, players can click onto them with the stylus and continue to change their path until the run out.  Additionally, the player must have a certain amount of energy to be able to select them which regenerates over time or can be obtained by destroying buildings.  To help the player, a mini-map is also located at the top of the screen which shows locations of buildings, which types of buildings they are and the buildings health status.

Each storm also has their own special attacks which are only available after they reach a level three later into the game and can be accessed by clicking an icon above the disaster.  The tornado becomes much more powerful and has the ability to cause more damage.  The lightning storm can cause fires to buildings which the player can then blow into the DS' microphone to fan the flames and spread them.  The ice storm causes a blizzard which will weaken buildings for other storms.  The earthquake will become more powerful when the player continually taps the center of the earthquake with the meteor storm has the same effect.

However there are attempts to halt the players progress which certain buildings that can instantly stop the players selected disaster.  A tornado trapper can suck up a tornado while a cloud cruncher takes out lightning and ice storms.  The seismic nullifer prevents earthquakes while the meteor shield keeps meteors from destroying buildings and the weather sucker stops both tornadoes and storms.  The storm free zone building prevents any disaster from being performed around it and a weather repeller bounces storms and tornadoes off of them.  There are also two types of drones that come in from time to time: a repairing drone will fly around and repair a building while a rebuilding drone will instantly bring a building back without any time to rebuild it.  The player can use the lightning storm to hover above these drones and destroy them.

Power-ups are also scattered throughout the level which will upgrade their storm or disaster to the next level for a brief amount of time.  To use these power-ups, the player must have their storm or disaster consume them, however the color much match the disaster that is being used, otherwise the power-up will have no effect.

There are also multiplayer modes that support up to three different players.  A race mode lets players complete a certain set of objectives given to them with the winner being the first player to complete them.  There is also a Tug-of-War where the main objective is to either have the largest amount of destruction monetary wise or through a certain percentage.</desc>

		<name>Elite Beat Agents</name>
		<desc>Elite Beat Agents is the spiritual sequel to Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan!  In this rhythm-based music game, the Elite Beat Agents are a special task force dedicated to helping people in need and righting wrongs through the power of song. 

The game is played entirely through use of the stylus.  Timing is required to line up the rings that close in on the circles to ensure the proper beat for the song.  Beats can also be scored by dragging a glowing ball through a set line area until the end of a beat.  Finally, players will be required to turn a spinner as quickly as possible during a music break.

The level stories are mostly comedic, where the Agents will help a girl and her jock boyfriend go steady, help a speeding taxi driver deliver a baby, and even help a weather reporter chase away rain clouds to go on a picnic with her son.  Each level is accompanied by popular songs such as Madonna's "Material Girl", Chicago's "You're the Inspiration", or Jamiroquai's "Canned Heat", among others, for 19 music tracks total.

Multiplayer allows gamers to compete against each other via single-card or multi-card play.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy IV</name>
		<desc>Final Fantasy IV is a remake of the classic Japanese RPG that was first released for SNES, known as  Final Fantasy II in the West. 

Unlike the many subsequent ports (to Playstation, GameBoy Advance, etc.), this release is a full remake, programmed from scratch with real-time 3D graphics. The characters have a "super-deformed" touch. There is also voice acting during cut-scenes. A new option has been added to the menu, which allows the player to read a conversation between party members and receive advice from them.

It also features many gameplay additions. The difficulty level has been increased, not only beyond the difficulty of the Western SNES release (which was reduced compared to Japanese original and subsequent ports), but even beyond the original difficulty. The party members are still bound by class, but they can now hunt for so-called "augments", which can be found or stolen from enemies and which grant the characters additional bonus abilities, resistances, spells that their class would normally not allow, etc. 

Beside those major changes, there are also plenty of minor additions. It is possible to obtain bonus items after exploring every corner and filling 100% of an area map; Rydia, the summoner girl, has a new monster summon who can be customized in various ways; there is a new quest involving the "naming" moogle of the original game, etc.</desc>

		<name>Giana Sisters DS</name>
		<desc>Giana Sisters DS is a modern 2009 remake of the cult game The Great Giana Sisters from the year 1987. The original game appeared on the C64 and Amiga, but had to be pulled from the shelves after Nintendo threatened to sue over similarities to the Super Mario games. Surprisingly, more than 20 years later the sisters make an appearance on the Nintendo DS.

Giana Sisters DS is a classic platformer. Giana is caught in a dream world and must now recover her lost diamonds and find a way to the mysterious castle. The game features more than 80 new levels (i.e. is not a one-to-one remake). There are also new special items that make use of the features of the DS. Giana can, for example, collect a bubble gum item that can be activated using the touch screen. The bubble enables Giana to fly and is controlled by blowing into the microphone. Another new feature is a world map that allows the player to select and replay levels.</desc>

The action starts as a character named Razzle, while cleaning the library, accidentally knocks some old books into a Portal. These books tumble down to the 'Island of Gorm' where a never ending battle is going on between vast armies inspired by the elemental forces of nature. The books eventually land at the feet of Magmion, the evil Lava Gormiti. Magmion reads the book and learns of an old legend which talks about reuniting five sacred amulets which have been scattered across Gorm. Once reunited these amulets allow the holder to open an inter-dimensional portal to Earth! The Lords of Nature need to use all their unique powers to hinder Magmion's plans and save Earth. The game recreates the beautifully illustrated island of Gorm, where the Lords of Earth, Sea, Air and Forest are charged with stopping the evil Magmion from wreaking havoc.</desc>

		<name>Hamsterz Life</name>
		<desc>Following the tradition of the Petz series for PC, Ubisoft brings now the series to the DS. This time with hamsters.

Like in other games of the series for the DS, the player has to care for his/her pet by feeding it, bathing it, brushing it and other such tasks. There are five different breeds to choose from and seven mini-games that randomly appear to give you food, costumes, toys and items for the cage where the hamsters live. And thanks to the wireless connection to other DSs, hamsters and other items can be shared with friends. The player can even store information on up to other 20 different owners.

Due to its Japanese origin, there are plenty of anime art elements in the game, for instance, and many other Japanese oddities like the possibility to teach your hamster to talk or store the blood type of other players. In addition, in Hamsterz the main goal is to raise your hamster in order for him to make itself a complete "Ham-country" (sic.), where it can build plenty of buildings like a school, a bakery, etc., making this the game of the series where the pet can behave closest to an actual human.</desc>

		<path>./Heroes of Mana (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Heroes of Mana</name>
		<desc>Heroes of Mana is a continuation of Square Enix's, World of Mana series, but with a new twist in the gameplay.  This time around the gameplay is now real-time, where players can build bases and their own armies consisting of humans, monsters and rabites throughout the Mana series.

The story takes place when a witch by the name of Anise brought darkness to the land, unleashing hordes of monsters on the world.  She is eventually defeated by the guardians of the trees, but the evil she unleashed was unable to me stopped until the Mana Goddess uses the Mana Sword to seal off the darkness in eight stones, bringing peace to the world.  This is where the players takes control of the main protagonist, Roget, a younger warrior who has learned that somehow the evil is coming back into the world and must embark on a quest with 10 other comrades and countless created units and stop the evil forces from being unleashed again.

The player uses the stylus mostly throughout the game, touching on a certain character and touching somewhere on the screen to move them around or draw circles around multi characters to move them all at once.  Players do battle by selecting their unit and tapping enemy units with the stylus to use that units attack skill on that selected enemy.  Players can also build building and units to help them out by gathering two resources throughout the game, Gaia (which is responsible for buildings) and Treant (for units) all of which is located in the players main base, a large ship. Each unit has a different skill, some are good against enemy units others are used for resource gathering.

Friends can also compete through Wi-Fi head-to-head as well as see their ranking against other players.  Players can also earn bonus items and maps through this if their ranking is high enough.  The music is also composed by Yoko Shimomura who is also responsible for music in games such as Kingdom Hearts, Legend of Mana and Super Mario RPG as well.</desc>

		<name>Impossible Mission</name>
		<desc>In six hours the evil Professor Elvin Atombender's nuclear missiles will launch and destroy strategic locations on the earth. Only one agent can infiltrate his secret base and undertake this Impossible Mission.

The goal of Impossible Mission is to acquire nine passwords and bring these to Atombender's Control Room in time to shut down the rockets. Unfortunately these passcodes (contained on punch cards) have been broken into four pieces each, and each piece hidden in computers, furniture, and waste bins throughout the base. On top of that Atombender has an entire army of robots patrolling the base. If a robot touches or shocks the agent then ten minutes are removed from the clock and the room is reset. The agent can jump over robots, but the only way to stop them is to expend a specific item on a room's computer terminal, and even that only disables them for a few seconds.

The 2007 release of the game has a few improvements over the original version, mostly to improve the graphics and make the game easier. The player can select one of three agents, although all of them possess the same abilities. Robots are now color coded according to what they are capable of doing (yellow only patrol, red patrol and shock, blue can follow and shock), but some aspects of each robot's personality can still only be figured out by watching or approaching them. Finally an easy mode has been added that adds an extra two hours to the clock and marks rooms which you have cleared out of items. The original mode with the original graphics can also be played, as well as a "mixed" mode that uses the old avatar graphics, makes all robots the same color, but keeps any other graphical upgrades.</desc>

		<path>./Inazuma Eleven (Europe).zip</path>
		<name>Inazuma Eleven</name>
		<desc>Inazuma Eleven is a blend of a football (soccer) game and traditional RPG. The game stars Mark Evans, the captain and goalkeeper of Raimon Junior High School's football team. However, it seems that he is the only one who cares about playing as his teammates prefer to waste time in the clubroom. Because of that their club is the laughing stock of the whole school and on the verge of being disbanded. The team is given one last chance in winning a friendly match against one of the best teams. When all seems lost, there appears a transfer student and well-known player ? Axel Blaze. The team now has hopes for winning, but there are others that, for some reason, don't want the club to exist.

The game is divided into classic top-down exploration, during which the player walks around and interacts with NPCs, and real-time football matches. The matches play out in real-time and are controlled only with the stylus. All of the teammates on the field move automatically with the player being able to manually draw or point to their destination. Encountering a rival or enemy goal, the game pauses and the player is able to choose his action. These consist of standard moves and anime-styled supernatural skills.

As in any RPG, teammates gain levels and improve their statistics, which affect the way they perform and the outcome of their actions. The team is fully customizable with your teammates' position on the field and hundreds additional players among whom to recruit new ones from.</desc>

		<name>Inazuma Eleven 2 - Firestorm</name>
		<desc>Inazuma Eleven 2: Firestorm is a role-playing sports game that was released for Nintendo DS at the same time as the game Inazuma Eleven 2: Blizzard in Europe and Japan.

In this game you play as a football keeper, who plays for his school football team, winner of the last Football Frontier. However, an alien football team, the Gemini Storm, wants to destroy all the schools. So, as the player one starts going around all through Japan to look for new players to beat the Gemini Storm in a football match. When one reaches the city of Nara, you find out that the Prime Minister was kidnapped, and you'll have to face a football match with a team of undercover agents to save said Prime Minister. Afterward, when traveling to the city of Alpine, you will find the character Shawn Froste, who will help you in defeating the Gemini Storm.

In the game you take control of Mark, the football keeper, in the overworld, where you can collect items, improving yourself with training or taking part in random encounters. On the Inazuma Bus, you can recruit players for your team, restore your FP (Fitness Points) and TP (Technical Points), or travel to the different regions of Japan.
The matches are controlled with the stylus, and when you run into an opposing player, you start a duel which determines the possession of the ball. You can also use special abilities.</desc>

		<desc>Inkheart is based on the movie by director Iain Softley and the original fantasy book by German author Cornelia Funke. The game is a classic point-and-click adventure game. You take control of the main characters Mo, his daughter Meggie and Dustfinger, a fire-eater. Mo has been searching for the mysterious book Inkheart for a long time. When he finally discovers it in an old book store, he soon must find out that he is not the only one looking for it. The book puts him and his daughter in danger - and Meggie does not even know her fathers dark secret, that he has a unique magic ability...

Since books are the central point of the story, it is only fitting that you need to hold the DS in a book-like fashion.</desc>

		<path>./Jam Sessions 2 (USA) (En,Fr,Es) (NDSi Enhanced) [b].zip</path>
		<name>Jam Sessions 2</name>
		<desc>Jam Sessions is a reworked and localized version of the Japan-only DS title Hiite Utaeru DS Guitar M-06. It is a rhythm/music game, but rather than only offering musical challenges like other games in the genre, it can also be used as a tool - a pocket guitar. Simulating a guitar, the game part allows players to go through a list of famous songs. The chords are selected on the D-pad while the stylus is used to simulate strumming on the screen. Alternately, the L-button can be used to strum. The details are worked out thoroughly - speed and power change the sound, and downstrokes sound different from upstrokes. With only one strum string shown, only chord progression can be performed and no individual riffing or picking. The game does not punish players for not doing well, songs just keep on going regardless of the player's performance. There is a tutorial and warm up mode to get familiar with the controls.

As a tool, it allows players to compose their own songs and add a variety of effects. These include distortion, low cut, high cut, delay, chorus and flanger with extensive settings for each of them. These can be set invariably or made touch-specific. When using headphones or external speakers, the DS microphone can be used to sing along. Additionally, the DS can be plugged in to an amplifier via the headphone jack to output a more natural sound. A US re-release include a mini-amp in the package. Instead of using a stylus, pick-shaped variants were also made available.

In the top screen, players can add a metronome, guide bars and tab guides, along with different backgrounds and templates. Up to five different compositions can be saved.</desc>

		<path>./Jewel Match (USA) (En,Fr).zip</path>
		<name>Jewel Match</name>
		<desc>This is the Nintendo DS release of the well-received match-3 game Jewel Match for Windows/Macintosh. Due to the limited screen size of the handheld, the grid size of the levels had to be cut down from 14x14 to 12x12 tiles, thus forcing a complete redesign of all the levels. While at it the developers added some DS-only gameplay options like the new magical storm where the player can blow into the microphone to reshuffle the jewels. 

The basic idea of Jewel Match comes from Bejeweled / Diamond Mine - the player is presented with a grid of jewels. By swapping pairs of tiles which are next to each other, rows of three or more identical jewels can be formed that will disappear instantly, giving points to the player and making room for other gems falling from above to take their place. The levels have gaps and shaped areas, though, so pieces do not simply fall vertically but also can fall diagonally.

Jewel Match has its own victory criterion though. On each of the 150 levels, a selection of squares have gold or even silver backings. One match (gold) or two (silver) must be created over each of these against a ticking clock to clear the level. Later in the game there are jewels tied to their square with a golden or silver chain, which thus are not falling down and blocking empty squares beneath them. These jewels can be freed by matching them once or twice, too, which means that the most difficult squares must be matched four times (silver chain and silver background) to be cleared.

A succession of hammers are unlocked once you have scored a certain amount of points. The first removes a particular jewel, the second not only removes the gem but also any effects (background or chains) on the square, and the final one removes all gems of that colour. Another extra to be unlocked is a magical storm that will have the player blow into the DS microphone to mix up the jewels. Moreover, matching more than three jewels in a row will create gems with special powers. Matching four will create a joker gem while matching five gives a gem that, once activated, will destroy the whole row it is in. 

The game also offers a hot seat mode where two players can play the same level right after another, competing for the better clearing time.</desc>

		<name>Justice League Heroes</name>
		<desc>The DS version on Justice League Heroes, while not following the plot of its console brethren, has a similar premise where you play as a member of the titular super-hero team and travel to a number of locations where hordes of enemies run amok.

The game is played with a top-down view of the environment on the lower screen and a map on top.  The map displays the location of your next checkpoint and the positions of the enemies along with the status of your characters.  The lower screen, in addition to the action, has various function icons that can be activated with the stylus.

There are about a dozen missions broken into about forty sections.  Before each, you must pick two heroes from the line-up of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Flash.  Each has regular melee attacks, strong melee attacks, a ranged attack and a unique super-power move. They must use these abilities to defeat many enemies and move to the next checkpoint, completing objectives such as switch-flipping and item collection along the way.  You may swap between your two heroes at any time by tapping an icon on the screen.  Another icon lets you call in an AI-controlled hero for brief support.  There are six of these to choose from: Martian Manhunter, Zatanna, Green Lantern, Aquaman, Green Arrow and Huntress.  Each of these has a unique ability based on their powers.

In addition to the main game, there are two minigames and a third can be unlocked by inserting Justice League Heroes: The Flash into the GBA slot.</desc>

		<path>./Kung Fu Panda (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Kung Fu Panda</name>
		<desc>In this game based on the 2008 DreamWorks movie of the same name, the player is Po the panda. Po finds out that the best kung fu masters have been captured by the evil Tai Lung. Po is fat, loves to eat dumplings, and is pretty slow and clumsy at kung fu, so he is shocked when he is asked to go rescue them. Although some elements have been changed, the game's theme is largely identical to the movie and linear in design.

Po's journey consists of finding the five kung fu masters, mastering a new skill that they teach him, then continuing on to find Tai Lung. This game is a 3rd-person side-scroller with frequent use of the touch screen and seems largely based on the mechanics and engine employed in the DS version of Spider-Man 3.

Po's movements are controlled through the D-pad while attacks are performed by swiping the styles on the touch screen. These are also used to throw objects and perform the learned special moves. Most of the gameplay consists of hand to hand combat with enemies, and traversing levels by consulting your top screen mini-map. New moves are learned gradually and there are also small puzzle elements where Po needs to interact with the environment to progress.</desc>

		<desc>The Legend of Spyro: Dawn of the Dragon is an action-adventure video game, the third and final installment in The Legend of Spyro trilogy, as well as the tenth anniversary game of the series. 
 
The game begins three years later, after The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night with Spyro and Cynder, who are now teenagers, being broken free of their crystalline prison by mysterious enemies known as Grublins. Spyro and Cynder are tethered together with mysterious green energy chains created by the Dark Master before being carried away while Sparx is found by Hunter of Avalar, who was watching them from the shadows. Meanwhile, Spyro and Cynder find themselves in a dark, volcano like area. When they try to leave, they find out that they cannot as they are chained to the platform they awoke on. After defeating several waves of Grublins and avoiding an earth Golem that attacks them soon after, Spyro and Cynder manage to escape the Catacombs with the help of Hunter, who is with Sparx. After reaching safety in Twilight Falls, Hunter reveals to Spyro, Cynder and Sparx that the Dark Master, Malefor, had returned to the realm shortly after the events of The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night and has covered the land in darkness ever since.</desc>

The epic story of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker continues as Link finds himself lost and alone in unknown seas in a new adventure. Featuring intuitive touch-screen controls and innovative puzzles, The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass offers new challenges for fans of the series and an easy-to-grasp introduction for gamers new to The Legend of Zelda. But time grows short, and only the Phantom Hourglass can buy Link the minutes he'll need to survive.

Many months have passed since the events of The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, and Link, Tetra and Tetra's band of pirates have set sail in search of new lands. They come across a patch of ocean covered in a dense fog, in which they discover an abandoned ship. Tetra falls into danger when she explores the ship alone, and Link falls into the ocean when he attempts to rescue her. When he washes up unconscious on the shores of a mysterious island, he is awakened by the sound of a fairy's voice. With the aid of this fairy, he sets off to find Tetra and his way back to the seas he once knew.</desc>

• Wield weapons and solve puzzles, all with your stylus

• Duke it out with friends in multiplayer battle mode

• Link and Zelda adventure together for the first time

The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks sets hero Link on a daring new adventure. The game provides players with a new story, more puzzles and even a new mode of transportation. In this game, Link voyages by train, which offers up new possibilities for problem-solving. The game has the same look and feel established in the hit Nintendo DS game The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass.

• Link has a valuable new companion. While navigating dungeons, he's accompanied by a Phantom, a hulking suit of armor that responds to his commands. Players can tap the Phantom to take command of him, then draw a line on the touchscreen to direct him where to go. The stout Phantom can walk through fire or lava, be used as a platform to carry Link above dangers, or even run interference to block Link from harm.

• When Link conducts the train, players enjoy a satisfying combination of action and real-time puzzle solving as they determine which track to take and how to best manipulate their speed. When on the train, Link must plot the best route to the end of the line around ever-moving obstacles. While en route, Link might need to fire an onboard cannon at enemies who attack the train or sound the whistle to scare animals off the tracks.

• Link uses a variety of new items and weapons, including the Whirlwind, which players activate by blowing into the microphone of the Nintendo DS system.

• As with The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, players can draw notes on the in-game maps using the stylus on the touch screen.</desc>

		<name>Marvel Trading Card Game</name>
		<desc>Marvel Trading Card Game is a strict electronic conversion of the Vs. System collectible card game rules by Upper Deck. It includes cards from all of the Marvel-based Vs. sets through the X-Men set.

The gameplay involves head-to-head battles where players recruit superhero characters with various strengths and powers onto the playfield. Each character has a basic Attack and Defense value which determines the outcome of individual character battles. This basic mechanic is augmented by character powers, Equipment cards (which give the character additional powers/stats), Location cards (which affect multiple cards or game rules while they are face up), and Plot Twist cards (which are often played to change the outcome of individual character battles by boosting Attack or Defense values).

The game features two single player campaigns, tutorials, puzzles, and an online mode similar to Magic The Gathering Online. The online mode supports cross-platform play between the PC and PSP versions.</desc>

		<name>Master of the Monster Lair</name>
		<desc>Master of the Monster Lair is a dungeon crawling RPG with a different twist, whereas in previous dungeon crawlers the objective is to find the dungeons and monsters to clear them, the player creates the dungeon (or a monster lair in this case) in order to attract the monster and trap it to destroy it.  There are 23 different rooms to customize for the player's Monster Lair.

The story takes place in a small town called South Arc where the nearby forests are harboring monsters who regularly invade the town and scare of the citizens.  This is where the player takes control of an orphan called Owen who is searching for his first job where he encounters a magical talking shovel.  After realizing his destiny, he decides to start digging a lair and destroy the monster infestation.

The view of the game uses the DS dual-screen technology, showing the world in the top screen while the bottom screen will show maps and item menus.  The gameplay is the standard turn-based RPG battle, selecting options from a menu such as attack and casting spells as well as the option to turn and run from the battle.

Players can pick up items and currency from monsters that are defeated in battle and use them to buy new weapons and armor for future battles or even furniture for Owen's house.  There is also wireless capabilities where players can view and exchange dungeons through Wi-Fi.</desc>

		<name>Mega Man Star Force - Pegasus</name>
		<desc>A spin-off of the Mega Man Battle Network franchise, this game brings the franchise back with similar RPG gameplay but with an all-new Mega Man character and storyline to play through. This action RPG blends exploration with fast-paced battles, as players travel between real world and virtual "Wave World."

In Mega Man Star Force, players explore towns and interact with people in the real world while the action-packed battles take place in the virtual "Wave World." Enemy encounters take place on a three by five grid in a 3D perspective, where players use a portfolio of Battle Cards that each have distinct attributes and attack powers. As the story progresses, players will acquire additional cards to build an arsenal that reflects their personal strategy. Players can also connect wirelessly via the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection with friends to create a Brother Band network, where they can share cards and get status upgrades.</desc>

		<name>Mega Man ZX - Advent</name>
		<desc>Grey was a Reploid found in a hidden factory in suspended animation, accidentally awakened during battle.  Ashe was a human Hunter, chasing after treasures and bounties.  After their encounter with the evil Prometheus, they were rescued and taken to a Hunter Base, where their first mission was to help transport a mysterious Biometal.  With another attack on the train occurring during their mission, they attempt to protect it - the Biometal, Model A, fuses with them, allowing them to become a powerful Mega Man!  But other people are after Model A as well...

Mega Man ZX Advent is the sequel to Mega Man ZX.  Players can choose to play as either Grey or Ashe, each with their own storyline and slightly different weaponry, but the overall game remains the same.  The game itself plays much like the side-scrolling platformer Mega Man X.  However, once the main character fuses with the Biometal, they can transform into Model A, which allows them to steal the data of bosses, taking on their appearance as well as their abilities.</desc>

		<path>./Meteos (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Meteos</name>
		<desc>Designed by Masahiro Sakurai and produced by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, Meteos was the DS's second big-name puzzle game (after Polarium).  

Most of the game's action takes place on the bottom of the DS's two screens, where colored meteors plummet downwards towards a planet's atmosphere.  There, they form columns that the user can manipulate with either the stylus or a combination of the D-pad and A button.  When three or more meteors of the same color are arranged either vertically or horizontally, they "ignite" and rocket up towards the top screen.  Rockets carry upwards any other metors that happen to be above them, and by stringing together several ignitions it is possible to lift many blocks at once.  The ultimate objective of the game is to lift as many metors as possible back into "orbit" in the top screen; the game is over if the bottom screen fills up completely with meteors.  Meteos features many different "planets" that the user can play on, each with subtle variations (such as in gravity) that affect gameplay.</desc>

		<desc>Players care for and train their puppy by petting it, walking it and buying it supplies to play with. As a puppy competes in obedience and agility trials, owners can win money to purchase other puppy breeds. The pups will vary in gender, coloration and personality. Players purchase one of several breeds available at the beginning, then start spending time with their pup. They throw flying discs and balls to improve the pup’s agility, bathe it when it gets dirty and use their own personal voice commands to train the dog to do tricks. If players train it well enough, they will excel in obedience and agility trials and disc competitions, which will earn money that they can use to buy other supplies and puppy breeds. When players earn enough cash, they can buy even more puppies to live with their original pup. Players can socialize their pups by walking them around the town, where they will meet neighborhood dogs, and maybe even find new toys. Trips to the park and gym offer valuable training time to prepare for agility trials and disc competitions. Over time, the pup's stamina will increase so players can explore farther and farther. Players also can interact wirelessly with their friends' Nintendogs – they can set their DS to bark whenever another puppy is within wireless range.</desc>

Pac-Man must roll his way through Ghost-Land, collecting pellets and confronting Ghosts to save his family and restore peace to Pac-Land. Introducing an innovative new control scheme, Pac'N Roll lets players control Pac-Man with the Nintendo DS stylus. Players can roll and dash around the environment as well as execute maneuvers such as hairpin turns, immediate stops and precision rolling with effortless strokes of the stylus. In his quest to save Pac-Land, Pac-Man will venture through stages such as Castle Pac, Gyro-Jungle and the Ghost House, while facing perilous hazards like moving floors, dash panels, jump zones and wind zones. Along the way, Pac-Man will find power-ups like the Winged Chocolate, allowing him to fly through the worlds and jump over Ghosts, or the "Knight Chocolate," providing him with armor which grants him the power to crash through walls and withstand more damage. Pac'N Roll also includes the original Pac-Man arcade game, allowing up to two players to munch on pellets and claim the highest score.</desc>

		<name>Pac-Pix</name>
		<desc>Pac-Pix originally started as a tech-demo for the Nintendo DS when the DS was first announced. Many people at E3 liked the demo so much that Namco made it a full-fledged game. In this DS exclusive title, Pac-Man has been captured by the ghosts and you must save him. You use the touch-screen to draw Pac-Man and try to eat the ghosts.  There are a few different types of ghosts that require a different strategy for each type.

You have Pinky that just moves around slowly and Blue that will make a quick dash as you approach him. There is Numboos which is multiple ghosts with numbers and you must eat them in order if you wish to defeat them. Bari-Boo has a shield and you can only defeat him by attacking from behind, if you hit his shield in front of him or from the side you just bounce off. There's the ink ghosts which throw ink and then there's the block ghosts which require you to break their defenses with a bomb.

During your adventure you will learn to draw arrows to shoot ghosts and stun them, as well as ghosts that are floating in bubbles. You will also be able to draw bombs to destroy blocks that are in your path. There are many things to do with the touch screen in this game. Pac-Pix is a Pac-Man game like no other before it.</desc>

		<desc>Picross 3D is a pseudo-sequel to Picross DS.  As with the original game, your goal is to uncover the hidden image by using the number clues as your guide.  But unlike Picross DS, where the puzzles were flat, in Picross 3D, each puzzle is encased in a cube of a varying size and shape.  By chipping away and rotating the cube, the player can reveal the hidden picture.

Picross 3D has approximately 350 puzzles, across a variety of different themes.  Each puzzle is grouped into a particular theme, such as "Beach", "Sports" or "Fire", and when all the puzzles are found for a theme, a medal is added to the theme to indicate that it is complete.  Nearly every puzzle has a possibility for a three star rating.  To earn all three stars, the player must:

 solve the puzzle
 complete the puzzle within the time limit
 not make any mistakes

As with Picross DS, Picross 3D features a puzzle creator.  The user can create their own puzzles, and then, using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, send them onto the Internet to trade with friends, as well as receive additional ones.</desc>

		<name>Planet Puzzle League</name>
		<desc>Take on the world in Planet Puzzle League, a simple but addictive puzzle game that you may recognize as Tetris Attack, Panel De Pon, or Pokémon Puzzle League.  Colored tiles rise up from a bin, and its your job to arrange them horizontally or vertically in lines of three or more of the same tile.  This causes them to disappear.  Advanced players will be able to arrange tiles so that when they land, they clear additional tiles to stop the tiles from rising and score even more points!

Planet Puzzle League features a wide variety of different game modes to keep even the most dedicated puzzler busy:

1.  Endless - Play forever until you fail.  The tiles rise faster over time.
2.  Clear - Remove all the blocks down to the 'CLEAR' line, buried deep down.
3.  Garbage Challenge - Garbage blocks rain down on your bin - clear as many as you can!
4.  Vs. COM - Play against the CPU.  Try to get their tiles to reach the top of the bin first!
5.  Time Attack - See how many points you can earn in two minutes.
6.  Puzzle - Either clear the preset mind-bending puzzles, or try the various missions that you are given.

Similar to Brain Age, Planet Puzzle League features a 'Daily' Mode.  Play these short games once a day to track your skill over a long period of time.  Are you getting better?  Or worse?

You can also play multiplayer modes of the game, either locally, or over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.  Modes of play include Birthday Battle (play against people who share your date of birth), Free Play Battle (play an unranked match), and Friend Battle (play against Friends you've traded Friend Codes with).</desc>

		<path>./Polar Bowler (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Polar Bowler</name>
		<desc>Polar Bowler is a bowling game. But no ordinary, the game uses an Arctic theme (more or less). Furthermore, there is not even a ball in the game.

First off, the game offers two different game modes, “Straight Bowling” and “Power Bowling”. Furthermore there are 7 different lanes and 6 different characters in the game, so you can play an Ice bear, a Penguin, a Snowman, or even Santa Claus. But the game starts only with one lane and one character.

Straight Bowling acts much like the classic bowling. You have the ten pins and your character, which is the game’s substitute for your ball, and you must smash as many pins as possible in order to get a good score (and to win the game when you are not playing alone). You start your ride by positioning your character at the beginning where you want him to slide from. In contrary to a real bowling, you can’t throw the “ball” diagonal, but that’s not needed too. Once your ride has started, you can move your character left and right and change his destination. You can even slide a curve, if you’re good. If not, the physic do their job. You can even control how fast you slide, but that only at the beginning of the ride. Their, you can choose the speed by tighten the line you use to throw you into the lane.

Power Bowling sets on top of this. Here the game gets spiced up by Power Ups. After you positioned your character and tightened your line, at that time you can’t change your position anymore, Power Ups appear on the lane. Once you collect them, they work in this throw, and this throw only, once you return to the start, their bonuses will be reset. So you must collect them, and use them immediately (will be automatically used, when the character impacts on the pins). There are two different types of Power Ups, one that affect your character, and one that affects your score.

The following Power Ups are possible to find: Bomb (doubles the power of the character; at the impact it will smash more pins then regular), Zap (will send an electrical discharge out on impact with the pins, which will smash much more then the bomb), Vapor (will vaporize all pins on impact; will result in a strike even when you only touch one of the pins at the far sides), Multiplier (will multiply the amount of pins you smash with the type you collected for your total score), Multiplier can be found as 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, and 6x. Smashing 5 pins with a multiplier of 3x will result in 5 regular points and 10 power points.

The basic scoring is on both game modes the same, it is also the same like regular bowling rules. In Power Bowling mode, once you finished the game, the amount of power points you gathered, will be added to the regular points, and so both of them will determine your final score. So, with many strikes you can get awesome scores.

Every time you reach 200 points on a single lane, you unlock a new lane or a new character.

And like a real bowling game, the game can be a multiplayer game, were up to four player can participate, playing on the same computer in Hotseat mode.</desc>

		<path>./Polarium (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Polarium</name>
		<desc>This is a puzzle game similar to Tetris in that blocks fall from above, and to clear the lines before the screen fills up, you must create horizontal lines of all the same color (either black or white).  To change the color (or "polarity") of a block, you must select it with the stylus, then tap it again to make the block flip.  You can also drag the stylus along the screen to change the polarity if many block at the same time.

There is also a puzzle mode where time isn't as critical.  Blocks aren't falling, but are just in a certain pattern on the screen.  The object is to make the polarity of every block in each horizontal line the same.  But the trick is to do the entire screen with one swipe of the stylus.  There are 100 puzzles in this mode and they can get very difficult.

The most addicting part of this game is the multiplayer.  Utilizing the DS's two screens, you can see your blocks and your opponent's blocks.  As you create a horizontal line all of the same polarity, that line is then scrambled and sent to your adversary.  The object is to clear your screen before your opponent does.  The multiplayer mode does not require 2 Game Cards to play.  In fact, when the game is sent over to another DS through the IPL, they don't even need to play multiplayer.  The person that received the game can play a simple demo of the game by themselves.</desc>

		<name>Professor Layton and the Unwound Future</name>
		<desc>Professor Layton and his assistant Luke attend the unveiling of a new invention called a time machine.  The Prime Minister of London is volunteered as a test subject, but the machine explodes and there is no trace of him.  With the Prime Minister missing, London is in chaos!  Shortly after these events, the puzzle-solving pair receive a letter, which has apparently been sent by Luke's future self, stating that London is in serious trouble.  The Professor and Luke follow the directions in the letter, which leads them to their most exciting adventure yet... 
 
Professor Layton and the Unwound Future is the third installment in the Professor Layton series. As with the previous games in the series, players explore game scenes by tapping on areas of interest with the stylus.  Doing so can cause Layton and Luke to examine objects, talk to characters, finding hint coins (which can be spent on hints for difficult puzzles) and most importantly, discover puzzles that can be solved.  Puzzles range from math, to logic, to riddles to sliding block puzzles, as well as many more different types.  There are also "secret" areas in scenes which, when tapped, may leave a puff of dust or a rustle of leaves.  Repeatedly tapping on these areas reveals a hidden secret, such as a bonus hint coin, or even a hidden, more difficult puzzle. 
 
New to Unwound Future is the addition of the 'Super Hint'.  While as with the previous games, you can spend a hint coin to unlock up to three hints, there is also another option.  Once these three hints have been exhausted, for the price of two hint coins, you can unlock a more detailed 'Super Hint' as a last resort.  There are also three new minigames incorporated into the game.  In the Picture Book game, you must place the correct stickers in the right spots to make a story that makes sense.  In the Toy Car game, you must place tiles which navigate a toy car around the board, collect all the objects, and then reach the goal.  Finally, in the Parrot game, you must tie ropes onto pegs to help your parrot deliver parcels to people who have requested them.</desc>

		<name>Puchi Puchi Virus</name>
		<desc>Puchi Puchi Virus does not resemble the ordinary puzzle game. The usual "object drop" style was replaced with a more intuitive system of "object linkage". Its simple design and surprisingly in-depth game play can addict even the most demanding puzzle game enthusiasts. The object is to form at least a single triangle formation by linking viruses together and erasing them from the screen. Victory conditions vary from mission to mission, but erasing all of the viruses will be the fundamental rule of this game. Erase all the viruses and you win, but if the screen gets filled with the emerging viruses you lose. Note: there is a twist to this system that gives depth to the game play. Viruses turn to stone if left alone for a while, which cannot be selected to form a triangle. However, these stones can be erased if they are within a triangle that you create. With a little luck and practice players can rake in massive points by letting the viruses turn to stones and erasing them all at once.</desc>

		<path>./Puzzle Chronicles (USA) (En,Fr,Es).zip</path>
		<name>Puzzle Chronicles</name>
		<desc>Puzzle Chronicles is a casual game that combines item-matching puzzling with RPG elements, including character progression and a fantasy story line in the vein of Infinity's earlier titles Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords and Puzzle Kingdoms.

The puzzle part is played on a board with vertical divider line in the middle. The goal is to push the divider line back to decrease the opponent's territory until no more moves are possible. This is done by matching groups of three gems into like colours along the divider line. These groups fall on the board horizontally. Pushing the divider line back is done by destroying rage gems. There are also special abilities and a sidekick known as a Warbeast that attacks the enemy when a sufficient amount of gems of certain colour has been cleared.

Removing gems also enables the player to collect mana, power spells and items that are then used to attack the opponent and reduce their board space. In addition to the main puzzle game, there are five other mini-games ranging from upgrading the Warbeast companion to crafting new items, while navigating a number of different maps and completing simple quests.</desc>

Samantha Swift and the Hidden Roses of Athena is a hidden object game with adventure elements. The player has to collect objects from a list displayed at the bottom of the screen. Some of these objects are stored in a separate tools tab at the bottom, that acts like an inventory, where its objects can be picked up and used on certain parts of the scenery to solve puzzles.

		<path>./Scribblenauts (USA) (En,Fr,Es,Pt) [b].zip</path>
		<name>Scribblenauts</name>
		<desc>Scribblenauts is a side-scrolling action game based on puzzles. The goal is to have the character Maxwell overcome obstacles by summoning objects based on a dictionary of more than 20.000 words, partly based on the concept of the real-life game Mad Libs. This is done by writing an object's name on the touchscreen, letter by letter. When the word is recognized, the object spawns in the world, where it can be manipulated or act on its own. This leads to an endless amount of possibilities to progress through the game. For instance, when an item needs to be retrieved from a tree, you could summon a ladder to get it out, a football to hit it, or just a helicopter or an albatross to fly over there. There are also more bizarre examples, such as summoning a time machine, going back in time to fetch a dinosaur egg, make it hatch and then use it in the future to defeat an army of robot zombies. The list also includes weapons, historical people, and even references to popular cultures and internet memes. Profanity and trademarked objects are not recognized. There is also a spelling checker included to offer suggestions.

This game is a logical sequel to the gameplay mechanics of Drawn to Life, an earlier title by 5TH Cell, relying on the same concept of emergent gameplay, where the actual game is more of a toolbox, shaped through the player's interaction and different in each session. During the game Maxwell needs to collect starites. To do this, two to four objects are often summoned at the same time. There are general, slow puzzle levels, but also faster action levels filled with enemies, platforms, switches and traps. Often, the summoned objects and characters need to interact with each other. Players can earn "merits" for not using weapons in a level for instance and finding a more creative approach. When a level is completed, a silver star is awarded and the Free Play mode for the level is unlocked. When the level is then completed three more times, using a different approach each time, a gold star is provided.

By solving puzzles, Ollars are awarded, the game's currency. It can be exchanged for different avatars or visual changes. The game includes a level editor and support for Wi-Fi to share the levels. The existing levels can also be edited and the way certain summoned objects interact with each other can also be modified.</desc>

		<name>Sega Superstars Tennis</name>
		<desc>Sega's many franchises come together for a tennis tournament spanning the varied worlds created by them in the last twenty years. Sixteen characters over fifteen different Sega game series are represented, as are ten different courts based on those same franchises.

Exhibition and Tournament modes are included in the game. The first is a simple vs mode, whereas the tournament allows the player to unlock new characters and courts over a series of matches and other challenges, all related to tennis but also drawing heavily on the video game represented. Singles and doubles can be played by either humans or AI, with the player being able to choose his or her doubles partner.

Version differences are notable, as the Wii game misses out on online play in exchange for three different control modes utilising the Wii Remote (much like in Wii Sports tennis, the Wii Remote and nunchuck or the Classic Controller. Online play is included in the 360 and PS3 versions.

Each character has a special move to aid them with their tennis match, relating to the character. For example, Beat from Jet Set Radio has a power that allows the ball to grind against the net and shoot off at a random point, making it difficult to return. 

Minigames are included as both one-offs and part of the tournament. These include a Target-hitting game, The House of the Dead zombie killing game (hit moving zombies around a court before the timer runs out), a Space Harrier game, a Puyo Puyo game, a Virtua Cop game and a Samba De Amigo-related game.</desc>

The Joint Project, convened to discuss how to deal with the expanding anomaly, decided to send in four ships carrying humanity's finest soldiers and most cutting-edge technology. The mission: to investigate what lay on the other side of what had been dubbed the Schwarzwelt and find out if there was a way to stop it from eventually covering the Earth. You are an elite soldier hand-picked for the Strike Team, outfitted with a Demonica environment suit and posted to the Red Sprite under Commander Gore. Upon entering the Schwarzwelt, the crew finds itself forced to deal with harsh conditions, supernatural interference, and throngs of demons populating the bewildering world. What exactly is the Schwarzwelt? What awaits at the end of this strange journey? It is entirely in your hands to find out.</desc>

		<desc>When Bart finds a mysterious game manual, he realizes that he and his family have become the main characters of the newest hit video game -- The Simpsons Game! 
 
Each of the Simpsons are playable in this sidescroller action game and feature their own wacky, special abilities. Homer can transform into a large blob and roll his way through levels. Bart can don a cowl and cape and become Bartman, using his slingshot and gliding ability to overcome the game's goons. Lisa can use an all-touchscreen Hand of Buddha to solve puzzles and remove obstacles from her path, and Marge can control mobs to overwhelm anyone who stands in her way. 
 
Each of the game's twelve episodes parodies some bit of precious popular culture, including spoofs of such classic videogames as Frogger, Space Invaders, Pokémon, and Madden. The game is chock full of video and voice overs featuring the original cast and written by the show writers. The voices, story, and cutscenes means the game's irreverent humor include plenty of references for Simpsons fanatics who will catch all the inside jokes from old episodes. 
 
Exclusive to the DS game is "Pet Homer," a sort of virtual pet game where the player collects various items to feed to Homer (and watch the crazy outcome), as well as several multiplayer minigames.</desc>

		<name>Sonic Rush</name>
		<desc>Sonic's first outing on the Nintendo DS system features action in two screens with a story featuring Sonic getting involved in another one of Dr. Eggman's evil plots. A mysterious Emerald is left behind by Dr. Eggman, but an unfamiliar character makes off with it before Sonic can investigate! Sonic gives chase, and thus the adventure begins.

Playable characters in the game are Sonic the Hedgehog and new character Blaze the Cat. Appearances from other character include Miles "Tails" Prower, Amy Rose, Cream the Rabbit, and Knuckles the Echidna. Each playable character has four moves as well as a variety of "Trick actions" which, when performed, will raise your Tension Gauge. Filling the gauge allows you to do a Boost which will propel Sonic or Blaze at a high speed across the ground or along the air to defeat enemies or move certain blocks.

There are 14 levels that play out over both the top and bottom DS screens, giving you a bigger view of your surroundings. You will race through the levels collecting rings, using "gimmicks" such as bungee ropes and giant waterwheels, performing tricks, collecting power-ups, and defeating enemies. When you beat each level, or "act", you will face a Boss Act which is played out over the top screen in 3D. In addition to these levels, there are Special Stages. These are played on the touch screen, and unlike the rest of the game, feature control with the stylus.

Upon completion of the game, Time Attack mode will be available. In it, you play levels/boss acts for the best time record. Battle Play is a multiplayer mode in which two players compete to finish a level first. It can be played over single-card download or multi-card wireless.</desc>

		<name>Spider-Man 3</name>
		<desc>Based off the 2007 movie of the same name, Spider-Man 3 puts players in charge of the titular hero as he tries to once again New York City safe from the combined menace of the New Goblin, the Sandman, and Venom.

This version of the game is a 2D side-scrolling platformer with 3D stylized elements.  The action is primarily controlled using the touch screen.  Players use the stylus for combat, webbing, and item interaction. The game also allows for players to adventure in storylines not explored in the third film, such as facing familiar Spider-Man villains from the comic book mythos.

One of the main focal points of the new game is the inclusion of Spider-Man's black symbiote costume. When Spider-Man's "Rage" meter builds up, the black suit automatically takes over, allowing Spider-Man to become faster, aggressive, and more powerful.</desc>

Equally startling is the deadly booby trap she triggers in the process of opening a locked door. She barely outruns the giant boulder bearing down on her, escaping the palace only to fall into a surging river, unconscious. The fairy Kukri, imprisoned for centuries in the chamber Anise inadvertently unlocked, rescues her and takes her to the Castle of Albyon. Anise awakens in the presence of the King, whose son is being held by demons in the very palace Anise narrowly escaped from. Recent events have unshakably convinced the King that this thief is descended from the Legendary Hero of Albyon, he who slew the Ancient Demon King centuries ago, and so he commands her thusly: free the Prince from the vile demons... or be tried and convicted as a thief and locked away for life.</desc>

		<name>Tao's Adventure : Curse of the Demon Seal</name>
		<desc>In Tao's Adventure: Curse of the Demon Seal, the player controls the young Air Speller by the name of Tao. When his village gets attacked by Ancient Monsters, he is sent by the council over to the town of Mondominio to seek the help of a friend of his father. Mondominio is famous for containing the Monster Tower which was sealed for many years until a lightning storm hit the tower and broke the seal.nnnnThe game plays quite similarly to Azure Dreams. Most of it is based around leveling up, learning new spells, and collecting monster eggs from the monster tower, and then selling them in town or hatching them as pets that will aid you in your quest. The player begins with the basic elemental spells which are cast using the DS stylus. The battles, movements, and almost any action taken in the monster tower is turn-based. The higher the player progresses up the tower levels, the stronger the enemies become. With every five levels of the tower, the player will encounter a boss.</desc>

		<path>./Tetris DS (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Tetris DS</name>
		<desc>At its base, Tetris DS is the same Tetris gameplay that's been around for years: rotate and arrange Tetriminos to create full lines and make them disappear.  However, it also has a style very different from earlier Tetris games, new play modes, and online play.

Graphically and aurally, Tetris DS is based on classic NES games.  A portion of the graphics are sprites directly ripped from Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Donkey Kong, Balloon Fight, Metroid, Yoshi's Cookie, and The Legend of Zelda.  Remixes of music from these games are also used.

Standard mode includes the standard endless play option, the standard "get 25 lines to win" option, and the standard versus mode where clearing multiple lines at once adds lines to the bottom of your opponents' well.

Push mode is a versus game with a twist.  The player's moves and pieces are shown on the top screen, while the opponent's are on the bottom screen, both with gravity moving towards the center.  Instead of multiple line clears adding extra lines to the bottom of your opponent's well, though, the center is pushed towards their end, giving them a smaller play area.  Push back and forth until one side loses.

Touch mode presents you with a tall uneven stack of large Tetriminos.  The goal is to nudge or rotate them by dragging or tapping on the touch screen to create full lines and eventually clear the stack.

Puzzle mode offers 200 Tetris scenarios and presents you with a number of pieces.  You choose the order and rotation of the pieces to try and empty the well.

Mission mode gives you specific goals like "Use a square block to clear a line" or "Clear 3 lines with an L piece".  Finish the mission and you'll be given another.  Don't finish the mission and several rows of random blocks will be added to the bottom of the well before being given another mission.

Catch mode has the Tetriminos falling without direct player control.  Instead, the player controls a moving core of blocks which can rotate as a whole, as well as latch on to the falling Tetriminos.  The goal is to create a square of at least 4x4, causing an explosion which keeps the size of your core small.  Lose by allowing your core to get too large, or by losing enough energy; which occurs when you allow a Tetrimino to scroll past the bottom of the screen, your rotating core smacks into and destroys a Tetrimino, or you hit a falling enemy.

Multiplayer Standard, Mission, and Push modes can be played locally using one copy of Tetris DS.  Mission allows for up to 10 players competing for a high score.  Standard allows for up to 10 players, and has an option for Mario Kart-like items to aid you or harm your enemies.  Push mode remains a one-on-one experience.  With Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, you can play a two-player Standard game without items, a four-player Standard game with items, or a two-player Push mode game.</desc>

		<name>Theme Park</name>
		<desc>Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog. The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.

Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.

You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.

It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.</desc>

The politics behind the ring got heated, and not in your favor. When you finally claimed the title, someone came for you. And now you're here. You've woken up in what appears to be a rundown hospital in Mexico, and you can't remember a thing; your name, what you do, and certainly not why you're here. Lost in a land that is not your own, you need to get back to America. You hear talk of a local wrestling match where the winner goes on to wrestle at a nearby American Air Force base. This is the best shot you've got at getting home. But once you're in the ring, something strange happens. Your body seems to remember what your mind cannot. Punches, grapples, throws, and stomps all come naturally, as if you were a seasoned professional... This is where your journey begins. Find your way home, remember who you were, and claim what was rightfully yours.</desc>

		<name>TrackMania DS</name>
		<desc>The TrackMania series is now going portable with this Nintendo DS release.

Race with over 100 tracks by yourself or with your friends. The new modes exclusive to the game are 'Platform', in which you must navigate through complex levels without using too many retries, and 'Puzzle', in which you must create your own map with checkpoints and a limited number of building blocks to connect the pieces, and race to the finish, while the 'Race' mode is left intact. The game includes three environments to race: Desert (the environment used in TrackMania Original), Rally and Stadium (the environment used in TrackMania Nations).

Instead of complex racing simulators where you have to measure a correct speed to turn through narrow roads, this is an arcade-style racing game with high speeds (over 400 km/h!) and simple controls. All you have is accelerate, brake, horn and that's it! Of course, like it's PC counterparts, you can freely reset the track if you fall of the track, or if you want a better medal. There are three types of medals: bronze, silver and gold. You can either race with AI opponents or race by yourself. The main objective is to get to the finish line as fast as possible. The target time is given to you at the beginning of every track, depending on for which medal you are racing.

The game also includes a built-in map editor, which allows you to create a custom map with your stylus.</desc>

		<path>./Transformers - Autobots (USA) (Rev 1).zip</path>
		<name>Transformers - Autobots</name>
		<desc>Transformers: Autobots is the first game of the double movie tie-in for the 2008 movie. In the Autobots version players take command of the good guys. The game start outs in the big city where the players learns how to control the custom Transformer. Tapping the touchscreen has the transformer change from a quick-moving vehicle into a huge robot. The robot form can climb buildings, smash cars or other world objects, fight Decepticons, and learn the basics of the mission on earth.  
 
From there the player completes missions in the city and travels to other locations. By scanning the large number of vehicles in the environment it becomes possible to transform into them. Some are just for fun, like the ice cream truck, but there are also helicopters and planes. 
 
Players can compete against your friends, including those who bought Transformers: Decepticons, in several game modes in local 4-player multiplayer. Through Nintendo Wi-Fi players complete daily missions to earn points for the Autobots side in the battle for the Allspark. Player profiles can be uploaded and looked up on the game's official website where other profiles or scores can be checked out or compared. 
 
Aside from the gameplay mechanics and visual style, the Aubots version is quite different from the Decepticons version, with its own characters, missions, focus on situations in the movie and a different conclusion. Unlike the console versions the Transformers are initially restricted in their abilities and need to level up to a role-playing-like upgrade system. The game's focus is largely on attacking as there are little to no means of defence (including blocking), instead there are plenty of health icons.</desc>

		<desc>Like the show, the game focuses on the adventures of Alex, Max, and Justin Russo, teenage siblings who happen to be wizards. The game is split into several smaller episodes that end up tying into a larger plot involving a magical dress that Alex is making for a wizardry fashion show. 
 
Gameplay is a mix of point-and-click adventure game and action, with a heavier emphasis on the adventure aspects. In each episode, the kids learn a new spell, which is then used to solve a series of area-based puzzles. For example, early in the game Alex needs to break out of class in order to get a look at an off-limits globe showing her dress's location.</desc>

There are five variants for each of the 16 puzzles.

Depending on his score the player then gets rewarded a bronze, silver or gold medal and some coins which can then be spend for access to new cities (and therefore new puzzles) or purchasing new difficulty levels for any already unlocked puzzle.

		<name>Dragon Quest Heroes : Rocket Slime</name>
		<desc>(Known in Japan as "Slime Mori Mori Dragon Quest 2") The hero of this action-adventure is a slime—one of the most popular monsters from the Dragon Quest series. The game is set in the kingdom of Slimenia, a peaceful land that is suddenly invaded by a mysterious cartel called "the Plob," who then proceed to kidnap all the slimes in the capital city of Boingburg. Our protagonist, Rocket, is the only slime left behind, and must embark on a journey throughout Slimenia to save his friends and uncover the Plob's nefarious plot. The adventure stages consist of our hero bouncing and stretching, as well as carrying various objects on his head, while solving the mysteries behind each area, and rescuing his captured slime friends along the way. Simple, streamlined controls allow players of all ages and skill levels to take part in the action with ease. Each adventure stage culminates in Rocket hopping aboard a colossal slime-shaped war machine called the Schleiman Tank and battling it out with the enemy’s Monster Tanks. Customize tanks by collecting a vast array of weapons and items. Call upon allies, each with their own individual personality and abilities, to aid in the heated tank battles. Even shoot your fellow slimes so they can infiltrate and sabotage the enemy’s Monster Tank. Pit tanks against a friend’s in exciting player-vs.-player action, using the Nintendo DS wireless multiplayer game feature.</desc>

		<desc>Step into the shoes of the legendary hero, Indiana Jones, in an all new epic adventure! Set in the year 1939, Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings follows the rogue archaeologist on an all-new globe-trotting quest. From San Francisco's Chinatown to the lush jungles of Panama, Indy must use his whip, fists and wits to fight through ruthless opposition as he spars with his nemesis, Magnus Voller, in a race for a relic of biblical proportions - the Staff of Moses. Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings features completely interactive environments, where players need to call upon their wits and daring to make each spring-loaded environment a weapon in order to dispense of foes in clever and unexpected ways. Also, embark upon thrilling action sequences that remain true to the spirit established in scenes such as Indy's pursuit of the motorcade in Raiders of the Lost Ark, the mine-cart scene in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and the free-for-all aboard the tank in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.</desc>

1967: A woman is slouched over a table, apparently dead, in a room in the Hotel Cape West. A man is seen leaving the room.  
1980: Kyle Hyde wakes up in his car and speaks on the phone with Ed Vincent, his boss at Red Crown; Vincent fires Hyde for his negligence. He travels to the Cape West Apartments, where he lives. Just before he enters the building, he notices a mysterious woman wearing a hat and sunglasses. Soon afterwards, he discovers that the Cape West Apartments are to be demolished at the end of the month, and all the tenants are vacating. As he opens his apartment door, he notices a letter that tells him to find out what secrets the apartments hold, and an object known as the "Scarlet Star." Thus begins Last Window: The Secret of Cape West.</desc>

		<name>Luminous Arc</name>
		<desc>Luminous Arc is a strategy role-playing game. 

The story is set in a world in which there are two groups in apparent opposition: the Luminous church, and the witches. 

During the course of the story, the player controls a party made up of orphans who have been raised by the Luminous church. They are called the Garden Children, and are tasked with the condemnation of witches. However, soon after the beginning of the story, it becomes evident that things are not as clear-cut as they initially seem.

Structurally, the party moves from area to area, and the plot advances as the player progresses through battles. Equipment may be powered up through the use of a vitae forging system. Also, relationships with characters may be strengthened during post-fight "intermissions," leading to some bonuses in future battles.</desc>

		<path>./Robots (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Robots</name>
		<desc>Based on the Blue Sky film (distributed by Fox) of the same name,
Robots takes players on an adventure to save Robot city. When Rodney Copperbottom travels to Robot City to meet Big Weld, the famous inventor, he finds that something is wrong. Big Weld is missing and the evil Ratchet has taken over Big Weld Industries. With the help of his friends the Rusties, Rodney puts an end to Ratchet's villainous ways and restores order to the city.

Robots uses a unique perspective that combines 2D side-scrolling with 3D views. The game takes the player to locations from the movie like Robot City, Big Weld's Mansion, the Outmode, and Madame Gasket's Chop Shop. Using the invention mode, players build and upgrade Rodney's weapons including the wrench, scrap gun, electro zapper, and magno grenade. With a combination of navigation, jumping, and combat skills, players can make their way though the world of Robots and bring an end to Ratchet's tyranny.

In addition to the main story line, players will find robots in need all over the city. The parts these poor robots are missing can be found hidden in the numerous maps and returning the correct part rewards the player with power-ups and weapon upgrades. All of the maps are interconnected, so players can easily find their way back to a previous area to uncover additional secrets.The maps are connected with a transit ball mini-game, just like the transit system in the movie.

The DS version of the game features a map that can be annotated by the player, a unique 3D version of the transit ball game that utilizes the stylus for control, and 3D menus. In addition to the new features, the DS also includes high resolution maps that include more detail than the GBA version.</desc>

		<desc>Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth is the fifth game in the Ace Attorney series. It is an interquel set between Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trials and Tribulations and Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney. 
This game is a standard "point and click" adventure, with the player controlling Edgeworth's movements and what he interacts with. For each case, the goal is to collect evidence to determine who the perpetrator is, how the crime was committed and their motive. This is presented as a combination of a third-person view showing the characters at the crime scene and through animated close-up images of the characters, annotated by text dialog. In some cases, still images are used to highlight dramatic scenes.</desc>

		<name>Aquarium by DS</name>
		<desc>Aquarium by DS is a fish tank simulation in which the player can choose from 30 different underwater animals.  Additionally, the player can customize their tank in size and add different backgrounds and accessories like plants, rocks or even buildings like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. New fish types can be unlocked by taking good care of the aquariums residents.

And that's the aim of the game, taking care of the fish in the tank. They need to be fed, the tank has to be cleaned and water temp and salinity have to be adjusted to create a perfect environment. A wrong environment or an unsuitable mix of animals in the tank will result in the death of the players pets. Instead of swimming dead at the surface or bloody death animations they simply disappear from the screen. Not playing the game for a few days and therefore not feeding, will result in a deadly surprise, too.

Using the Wi-Fi-feature of the DS the player can swap fishes with other players.</desc>

		<name>Arctic Tale</name>
		<desc>Arctic Tale is based on the National Geography documentary of the same name. Players control a polar bear (both cub and adult) trying to survive in a harsh climate of snowy landscapes. There are eleven stages where the little bear explores the environment, searches for foods and collects paw prints that unlock pictures in a photo gallery and additional chapters. Later, two other animals can be controlled as well: a walrus that is also able to explore underwater environment, the fast Arctic fox able to hunt down rabbits and an orca whale.

The levels consist of free-roaming environments, on land or underwater, where the animals need to gather food to avoid having the heart icon fade away. While playing 16 different mini-games can be accessed where the player can earn bronze, silver and golds awards to unlock additional chapters. These games include Ice Slide (obstacle course), Shuffle (slide to the center of a ring), Food Fight, Ice Flow Rodeo (control a broken piece of ice through rough currents), Survive the Cold (cross an icy area using shelters to hide from the cold), Catch-a-Seal, Ice Sheet, Clam Scavenge (find eight hidden clams), Herd Flow (guide an ice block without hitting anything), Walrus Hunt, Orca Race and more.</desc>

		<desc>Annie was just a simple girl who lived in a town located within the mainland. However, all she did was sleep and fantasize about becoming rich and famous someday by marrying up. Worried about their daughter, her parents consulted Annie's grandfather, a great alchemist, for advice on what to do. After a moment of thought, he decides to send her to Sera Island to take part in a large resort project in order to teach her to overcome her laziness. Thus, in the middle of the night, his homunculi steal Annie away to Sera Island; across land, across river, and across sea. 
Atelier Annie: Alchemists of Sera Island is the first game to be released in North America to have the gameplay and structure of the "main" Atelier series, having less emphasis on RPG elements and more focus on item creation and resource management.</desc>

		<path>./Avalon Code (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Avalon Code</name>
		<desc>Avalon Code is a hack and slash Action-RPG that takes place in a world about to end.  Choosing between a male or female avatar, the player is given the Book of Prophecy from which the world will be remade.  Everything in the world can be scanned and recorded into the Book of Prophecy, and players can further redefine an entry's properties by mixing and matching pieces of code.  

Codes in Avalon Code are Tetris-like chunks which fit into each book entry's grid of available code space.  Think of these codes like genes in a DNA sequence that you can grab and move with the stylus.  For example, elemental properties (such as fire) can be incorporated into a weapon, allowing you to melt ice.  Removing codes from enemies allows you to weaken them, making them easier to dispatch.

Players string together light combos and can perform charged special moves.  Additionally, the player can begin a Judgment Link which juggles the enemy higher and higher (with proper timing) which yields precious HP, MP and Gem bonuses.  Dungeons are somewhat unique in that each room is a timed challenge, with requirements such as hitting all switches, defeating all enemies, Judgment Linking xN, and/or various combinations of these.</desc>

 Over the centuries, the factory has been developing clockwork devices, specializing in perpetual mechanical movement. The factory's ambitions, however, are ill-suited to the contemporary economic climate, and the elderly Anna Voralberg, at the helm of the Valadilene factory for more than half a century, has decided to sell up. 

It turns out that the takeover might not be as straightforward as expected. The day that Kate Walker arrives, Anna Voralberg is being buried. What is more is that she has left an heir – her brother Hans. But Hans had left the valley at the end of the thirties and never returned, and was actually believed to be dead. However, a letter written by Anna in the days leading up to her death reveals that Hans is well and truly alive and living somewhere in… Siberia! 
 Valadilene's elderly notary entrusted to take care of Anna's affairs suggests that Kate find Hans Voralberg as he is now the only person in a position to ratify the sale of the family business. You are on your way...</desc>

The perspective has been heightened, to a more top-down view, although the paddle is still shown from a first-person perspective. Movement of the paddle is entirely done through the stylus, with the buttons used to add additional effect. The tournament mode has been removed and it is replaced by a multi-player mode, with up to two players through a wireless connection. Next to that, the game contains the same modes, characters, venues, options and two additional trophies.

An extra mini-game has been added during the credits where the player can swat bees with the head of a spoon like Randy Daytona in the movie. Players need to swat as many bees as possible before the credits end.</desc>

		<path>./Bejeweled Twist (USA) (NDSi Enhanced) [b].zip</path>
		<name>Bejeweled Twist</name>
		<desc>Bejeweled Twist is a tile matching game, where the player rotates groups of four jewels to create rows and columns of three or more matching gems. In the Classic and Zen modes, the objective is to make enough matches to fill a tube at the left side of the screen to move to the next level. There's a chain meter at the top of this tube, that builds up with matches in a row multiplying the points, and making a fruit jewel appear when full. A box at the tube bottom shows the sequence of matches needed for bonus points.

Obstacles appear randomly on the game board. The coal can't be matched, but it can be exploded by one of the power-ups gems. The locked jewel is chained to its place and can't move, but it can be removed with a match. Bomb gems display the number of moves allowed before they explode, destroying the board and ending the game. They have to be matched before their counters reach zero, otherwise a revolving wheel-of-fortune appears that stops in one of two values, skulls or gems, that either detonate or disarm the bomb. This mini-game becomes more difficult every time it comes up.

The power-ups appear after making matches of four or more gems. A four jewel match creates the flame gem, that explodes when matched removing all surrounding jewels. A five jewel match creates the lightning gem, that destroys a column and a row at the same time in a cross of fire.

With the exception of Classic Mode , the other modes are unlocked with continuous playing. Zen Mode is similar to Classic, but is more relaxed without the bomb and locked jewels. Challenge Mode is a puzzle mode, where the objective is to perform a task, like removing all gems of one color, or making a number of matches in a row. In Blitz Mode, the goal is to accumulate the maximum amount of points possible within a time limit.</desc>

With the money she earns, Betty wants a shot at stardom.

It is a classic waitress game where the player controls Betty to manage the crowd visiting the club. Gameplay is divided into two shifts. She has to direct customers to seats, take their orders and serve them. Orders include candy, a milkshake or a specific song from the band. Based on the speed Betty fulfils the requests, a tip is awarded. Serving is done through the stylus by matching the correct colours, but Betty also has to keep an eye on the crowd kept outside by doorman Gorilla and the rest the band needs between songs.

When the first shift is completed, Betty enters the stage to perform. A bar of notes is shown on the top screen and players need to select the corresponding notes in the correct order on the bottom screen to wow the audience.

By doing well through both shifts, a gold star is awarded. It can be used in the following shifts to trigger the power mode where Betty uses her charm to entertain all guests at once. Customers such as Snobby Sally, Goons, Lazy Bones, Slobs, Critics and Military boys all have different characteristics and needs that are to be taken into account.

In the multiplayer mode players go head to head in a first shift memory matching game or take the stage in the note tapping second shift.</desc>

		<desc>Help the Biker Mice From Mars, Vinnie, Modo, and Throttle, in their quest to save planet Mars from destruction with the help of the Regenerator, a machine that can create water for the Martians to continue to survive with.  With the original Regenerator destroyed beyond repair, the trio must head to planet Earth to rescue Stoker, who can help them create another.

Biker Mice From Mars is a hybrid of a racing game, and a side-scrolling beat-em-up.  Take the role of Vinnie, Modo or Throttle, and race against opponents as well as beating them up in your quest to rescue the planet Mars.  During the racing sections of the game, you can fire rockets at your foes (once collected from crates scattered on the track), or boost ahead of opponents.  You're also racing against a time limit, and must make it to the end of the track before time is up.  Destroying enemies will add precious seconds to your timer.

The beat-em-up sections are fairly straightforward.  You walk to the end of each stage, beating up opponents with punches and kicks as you progress.  The screen locks into place when a group of enemies appear, and you must beat them before you can move on.  The mice can also pick up thrown grenades and throw them back at enemies, as well as climb up and down certain objects to take different paths.</desc>

		<name>Bomberman Land Touch!</name>
		<desc>Bomberman Land Touch! is the second Bomberman game for the Nintendo DS (Bomberman being the first game) and it changes the usual gameplay of Bomberman for a mix of adventure and mini-games.

In the story mode, all the bombermen travel to Bomber Island, a pirate theme park, invited by Giant Gold (yellow bomberman), whose father is rich and has rented the park for a day. The goal of Giant Gold is to conquer the island with the help of the rest of the bombermen, all of which are named after their colors: Cheerful White (the player), Giant Gold, Cool Black, Kid Blue, Pretty Pink (the only girl) and Bookworm Green. 

Once the game starts, we control Cheerful White and we can explore the whole island, which consists in 5 different areas: Spades (the starting point), Diamonds, Hearts and Clubs area, where pieces of the same name can be collected, and the castle. This pieces are collected mostly by winning at mini-games, which are usually based on bombs and serve as the attractions of the park, and are used to open new areas of the map. There is also plenty of characters that give you useful information or send you to solve some quest. The rest of the bombermen will also give you info and quests, and sometimes they will wait you at some of the attractions that you finished and challenge you to it.

In addition to this game mode, there is the Attraction mode and Battle mode, both multiplayer. In the first one, all the attractions already won can be replayed. In the Battle mode, which is played only with buttons (unlike in the other two modes), the multiplayer mode of the previous Bomberman is recovered. The only difference between both battle modes (as modes, levels, option etc. are exactly the same) is that each of the contenders have to have their own cartridge of the game in the Land Touch version.</desc>

		<name>Bookworm</name>
		<desc>Bookworm is a word-forming computer puzzle game by PopCap Games. From a grid of available letters, players connect letters to form words. As words are formed, they are removed from the grid and the remaining letters collapse to fill the available space. As in Scrabble, players earn more points by creating longer words or words which use less common letters and earn less for smaller words. In November 2006, PopCap Games released a sequel, Bookworm Adventures. Bookworm was released for the Nintendo DS digital distribution service DSiWare on November 30, 2009.[2] It has also been released on the regular Nintendo DS cartridge.[3]</desc>

		<name>Bubble Bobble Double Shot</name>
		<desc>Bubble-blowing dragons Bub and Bob return (now with buddy Bubu in tow) for a more traditional 2D platform romp than earlier DS title Bubble Bobble Revolution, still however retaining some of its gameplay innovations.

The basic gameplay is as has lasted the test of time: expelling bubbles from their mouths, the adorable dragons first incapacitate monsters by enveloping them in bubbles, then put them out of commission by popping the containing bubble (replacing the enemy with a tasty piece of fruit!) -- each level ending with every enemy popped, through ten worlds of ten levels each with a boss fight at the end of each world.  A trapped monster, if left unpopped, will eventually free itself, now red, angry, fast and aggressive, and if it takes too long for the dragons to clean up a level, the notorious invincible ghost whale "Baron von Blubba" appears to turn up the heat.

Things escalate in complexity quite quickly, however, considering that each dragon blows a different colour of bubble -- and that some enemies (designated by colour-coded stars) can only be trapped by certain-coloured bubbles.  (Complicating things further, some enemies need to be trapped by combinations of two differently-coloured bubbles before they're down for the count.  These elements remain even in single-player mode, where the player has the option of toggling their colour mid-game to produce the necessary bubble colour.)

An array of traditional power-ups (shot distance, movement speed, etc.), weapons (lightning bolts, floods and firebombs) and bonuses (freeze enemies, invincibility, flood level, etc.) remain in effect, as does the longstanding E-X-T-E-N-D bonus mechanism -- here regulated (among other effects) through subtle machinations of the new star bubble type.

When player lives are expended, the option of continuing is granted according to player performance in mini-games making use of the DS touchscreen and stylus, ramping up in difficulty through every continue used.</desc>

		<name>Burger Island</name>
		<desc>After her sailboat crashed in Mount Tikikola Beach, Patty Melton decided to start a new life. She gets a work at Beach Burger. To her surprise, the owners decide to retire and leave her their business. Now, as the main "chef" in Beach Burger, Patty has to spread her franchise all the way to the capital city of Honochuchu.

Burger Island is an action game which simulates a burger restaurant. The player has to prepare burgers, shakes and fries made of over 30 different recipes. The gameplay consists in clicking in the ingredients and placing them in the correct order for each recipe. For a hamburger, for instance, the player has to click in the burger stack to pick one and then click in the grill to start frying it. The player has to wait for it to get well done and then place it in the bread, adding ketchup and the top slice. Each order has a time limit to be done, or else the customer will quit waiting. Also, Patty starts working at 10:30 AM and ends at 9:00 PM, and has to reach a daily goal. If she fails to reach it, she'll lose a life.

Each stage has a different kind of order to be prepared, being it burgers, shakes or fries. At first, Patty knows only one recipe of each kind of order, but in between levels new recipes can be bought. New recipes are harder to prepare, but are also more expensive. Earning more money is necessary as the stages go by due to the higher goals to be reached. As the daily shift remains the same, more expensive recipes are needed to reach the daily goal.

The game has a total of 60 levels and three difficulty levels.</desc>

		<path>./Chicken Shoot (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).zip</path>
		<name>Chicken Shoot</name>
		<desc>Chicken Shoot is a gallery shooting game based on free 2003 flash game of the same name. The player shoots all the chickens that appear on the 2D hand-drawn screens. The top screen is used to show the gameplay, while the bottom one shows statistics such as the remaining time, the score, the type of gun and the remaining ammo. The game can be controlled through the buttons, or in combination with the stylus to aim at the chickens.

The basic game modes are identical to those of the Wii version: Arcade (shoot a specific number of chickens), Classic (time limit) and Catch an Egg (a mini-game where eggs need to be caught before they drop on the ground). Different kinds of guns can be picked up and every now and then enemies thrown an egg towards the screen that needs to be blown up quickly. Extra points are awarded for shooting certain background items, bombs destroy everything on the screen, food can be picked up to refill energy (Arcade) and clocks add more time (Classic). There are six levels/environments: The Village, The Forest, Nevada Desert, Antarctica, Rocky Island and Sahara.

There are two multi-player modes: cooperative gameplay for two players or a four-player competitive game mode where players need to score as much points as possible in a set amount of time.</desc>

This gives the main characters, Ferrik, Tamber, Poppen and Wanderer, who's parents were killed in the disaster, reason to find out what happened. The game takes place on the Island of Illusia, at the center of which lies the Mana Tree.

The game is a real time Action/RPG very similar to the style of Secret of Mana. New features include dual weapon systems, so characters can use one long range and one melee weapon at a time. 

Although there is much more that can be done with each weapon, there are only four in the game, as opposed to twice as many in previous titles.

The game supports Wireless LAN for 4 players.</desc>

		<path>./Chrono Trigger (USA) (En,Fr).zip</path>
		<name>Chrono Trigger</name>
		<desc>What begins as a carefree day at the Millennial Fair for a young man named Crono turns into his ultimate adventure. When Crono meets a young girl named Marle, little does he realize that this young girl, his best friend Lucca's invention, and a mysterious pendant will thrust him into the ultimate trip through time and space, encountering new friends, defeating the forces of evil, and encountering the one who would destroy the flow of time.

Chrono Trigger is a role-playing game, with the usual game mechanics fare for such: the player takes control of a variably large party, developing the combat skills of its members and managing their equipment. As the characters grow in power, not only their ability scores increase, but they also learn new "Techs" - special powerful attacks and maneuvers which cost them "Magic Points" to use in battle. 

The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from  Final Fantasy games - sort of a mix of turn-based and real-time combat -  adding to it combo attacks. Apart from normal Techs, it is possible to use Double and Triple Techniques - super-powerful attacks which involve two or three characters using their abilities at once. There are no random battles in the game, as all the enemies are visible on screen, and it's even possible to just pass by them entirely. 

The game allows you to face your ultimate adversary at different points of time, which leads to several different endings. There is also a New Game+ option, which allows you to carry over your powerful characters to a new game, and adds even more endings to the already existing ones.</desc>

		<name>Code Lyoko</name>
		<desc>Code Lyoko is a game based on the French animated television series. Five boarding school students - Ulrich, Odd, Jeremy and Yumi - fight against a digital entity named X.A.N.A. They travel to the virtual world of Lyoko and help their virtual friend Aelita fend off X.A.N.A.s forces.

The game follows both aspects of the kids' lives, and the player can enjoy 3D Action Role Playing within the world of Lyoko and 2D Adventuring in the real world.

The game is made of 15 chapters, and each chapter is split into two portions. One portion is a PC-style 2D point-and-click adventure, where you take control of one of the characters to visit different locations, talk to people, gather items, and generally watch the story unfold. The other portion is a 3D action level where you swap among characters and use their abilities to fight monsters, hop between platforms, or climb up hillsides in search of the tower that'll put and end to whatever problem is currently pestering the real world. Occasionally, the player has to solve touch-screen puzzles and pass vehicle-based levels.</desc>

		<name>Color Cross</name>
		<desc>Color Cross is a picture puzzle game similar to Picross, where the objective is to fill all the correct cells in a grid to form a picture. Each row and column has a series of numbers as clues, indicating the groups of continuous cells that must be painted. The player must use logic to discover the remaining spots and complete the figure.

The main difference this time is the addition of multiple colors per picture, instead of the monochromatic approach of other titles. Players can select back and forth between colors by clicking on the palette at the side of the screen. Cells can be painted individually or as a group by clicking and dragging across them with the cursor. In each color option, cells can be marked with an X to point them out as incorrect places. Any mistakes are corrected automatically, affecting the final score.

New levels are unlocked with each completed picture. They are organized by picture theme at the level selection menu. Every time a line or column is completed, the clue numbers become grayed out and a shower of candies, fairies and other theme-related items fall from it to the bottom of the screen.</desc>

		<desc>A professor in a search for intelligent life makes contact...with you.  Communicating with him through the Nintendo DS, he asks for your help!  He and his assistant, Terry, have crash-landed on an unknown island, and the professor needs to make repairs to his ship.  Subtly guide Terry around the island (and later on, the world!) to help them both.

Contact is an adventure game with a difference.  The professor from the game is aware of your presence, but his assistant, Terry, is not.  You indirectly control Terry by moving him around the game world and issue commands to him.  Every action that Terry makes has a corresponding statistic, and these can be levelled up by using them frequently.  Run everywhere, and Terry's speed will increase.  Take damage, and while your health will decrease, your stamina will increase, allowing you to take more hits.  Steal items and your thievery skills will increase, and so on.

The game also supports the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.  Swap Friend Codes with other people, and when you connect to their game on the Internet, you'll be able to exchange data, as well as send an NPC version of your character into their copy of the game.</desc>

		<name>Crazy Machines</name>
		<desc>Similar to The Incredible Machine the player needs to use animated parts to assemble a Rube Goldberg-type contraption and solve puzzles by doing so.

The game features three different modes: Classic, Arcade or Construction Kit. The classic mode requires the player to place the parts and manually activate the machine to get the ball to it's goal, the arcade mode confronts the player with an already finished and running machine which needs a little help. By using the stylus or blowing into the microphone the player not only moves the ball through the experiment but also activates and uses the parts of the machine. By successfully completing all those puzzles, the player unlocks additional components which are then at his disposal in the construction kit to freely construct anything he wants without a time or space limit.

Although the game doesn't feature a traditional multiplayer-mode, the players can trade their experiments with friends over the wireless connection.</desc>

Word searches display a grid of letters on the touch screen. Simply drag the stylus across the letters you think form the word, and if you're correct, the word will be marked off the list. Anagrams gives the player a set of letters - these are used to try and form all the words possible with the combination of letters.

		<desc>The fifth game in the Custom Robo series, Custom Robo Arena moves the action into the portable realm again with the first entry on the DS. It is the first in the series to be released in PAL territories, and the second in North America.

The story has the player's character joining the Robo Team 'Numero Uno' and the story unfolds as they attempt to win the Robo Cup. Like all the Custom Robo games, except the GBA incarnation, the battles are conducted in 3D, with the player attempting to defeat their opponent, in a Pokémon fashion similar to the previous games. The touch screen is used to clean off the player's Robo after it becomes dirty, as this reduces its efficiency.

In another first it offers 2 player multiplayer over Nintendo Wi-Fi and allows voice chat and utilises the rivals system seen in Metroid Prime: Hunters.</desc>

Party creation is basic by most modern standards. 
Four races, three alignments, four classes along with five different stat points are all there are to decide what your character is.

These four characters begin the game inexperienced and weak like almost every RPG. They gain skills, power and better quality items as they progress through the various dungeons.

Experience points are spent on skills for the characters, some of these opening the choice to upgrade one of the 4 basic classes to become a different prestige class, offering different abilities.

The game is played without use of the touchscreen and only uses the direction pad and buttons. The top screen displays the party location in 3d and the bottom screen has info on their status.</desc>

		<desc>A mysterious priest called Papa Blanc, who is actually the villain from the first game, Comrade Black, in disguise, is doing his utmost to rig the outcome of the vote by cheating with an artificial metal arm in each voting booth that presses Blanc, allowing his cult of Inkies to wreak all manner of colour-related havoc on the metropolis. The INKT Corporation. as before, manages to drain all colour from the city and also turns its inhabitants, the Raydians, into generic drones. Once again, it is up to Blob and the members of the Colour Underground to restore the city to its vibrant former glory. Blob frees the lands one by one, as he did in the last game, fighting against many foes, including a massive monster created in a factory accident, as he approaches Comrade Black. Black, however, is shown to be more clever than was suggested in the previous game. At one point, he kidnaps the other members of the Color Underground. Once De Blob frees all of Prisma City, he confronts Comrade Black again, only to discover, as he flees to space once again, that Black had used Blob's own journey against him, using color beacons that were mysteriously activated as Blob progressed to power an orbiting satellite to enslave the entire planet. As Blob gets closer and closer, Black taunts him and forces him to make a series of choices: continue on, or rescue a few Graydians that Black had placed in biodomes rigged to explode and risk running out of time. Once Blob finally reaches him, Black uses a high-power beam of color to grow gigantic and fight Blob.</desc>

		<name>Deal Or No Deal</name>
		<desc>Deal or No Deal is based on the TV game show of the same name. It puts one contest against a banker. At the start of the game, the player choose one of the 26 briefcases. They contain prize money ranging from $.01 to $1,000,000. The different amounts are shown on a game board. Each round the player has to open a number of the remaining briefcases which are then marked on the board (six in the first round, five in the second, four in the third). Based on the remaining amount of money, the banker offers the player a deal, a certain amount of money, based on odds. The player can choose to accept the deal when large sums are gone, or decide to go through. After the third round the briefcase is opened and if it contains a higher sum than what the banker offered, the player has made a great deal.

In singleplayer, three modes are available: TV Game (classic gameplay), Vault Game (Find the 3-number combination to a vault in the correct order in as few turns as possible. The initial prize is $500,000 and each turn the prize fund is reduced.) and High Low (Pick a briefcase and then make a calculated guess if the next briefcase will contain a higher or lower sum. For each correct guess, the prize money is increased). Two-player multiplayer offers Head to Head (classic gameplay to get the best deal) or Best Deal where one of the players becomes the banker.

Gameplay consists solely of picking numbers and calculated guesses. No other interactive game elements are present.</desc>

		<desc>When Tiger Island is taken over by the evil Wizpig, Timber sends a letter to Diddy to request his assistance.  Diddy, Dixie, Tiny Kong and the rogue Kremling Krunch turn up to help Timber and his friends, Bumper, Tiptup and Pipsy.

Diddy Kong Racing DS is remake of the Nintendo 64 game of the same name.  However, while the story and setting remains the same, this is more of an upgrade instead of a port.  Players can still race around assorted tracks around Tiger Island via kart, hovercraft or plane, winning races to earn golden balloons to progress and defeating bosses to confront Wizpig.

There have been subtle tweaks to the gameplay.  While you can still level up your balloons by collecting another of the same colored balloon in a row, collecting a different colored balloon will not change your weapon - you'll have to fire your current weapon first.  The Silver Coin Challenge from the original game has been removed from the main adventure, and is replaced with a first-person touch screen shooter where you fly around on Taj's magic carpet and aim to pop as many balloons as you can.  There's also an optional racing mode where you race by using the stylus to guide the vehicle through a top-down map.

The game now supports currency system for most unlockables - dotted along the track are coins, which can be used to buy 'wishes' from Taj the Genie.  These include anything from new characters, exclusive tracks, a custom track editor, battle modes to unlock in multiplayer and so forth.  The DS version of Diddy Kong Racing also heavily supports multiplayer.  You can play with one game card or multiple game cards (to a maximum of eight players), or online to a maximum of six players.  Similar to Mario Kart DS, you can design your own custom decal and have it as your visual representation for when you race around the world.</desc>

The gameplay uses many devices from traditional JRPGs, including random encounters and a battle field similar to Dragon Quest.  The main goal of the game is to properly raise your team of digital monsters (or Digimon) either by leading them in battle or maintaining them in a Digi-farm.  Along the way, you will have to complete dozens of quests which you discover by interacting with your Digimon.  When you're not completing side-quests or moving along the main storyline, you can battle and trade with your friends via Wi-Fi.</desc>

		<name>Draglade</name>
		<desc>Draglade is a unique take on fighting games.  Scientists have found a way to harness atmospheric energy called G-Cons, into a weapon called a glade, when hit against another object emits a sound.  Promoters realized the potential and soon developed a sport called Grapping, in which fighters use these glades not only to fight, but produce music as well in order to entertain fans.  You play as four different fighters, Hibito, Guy, Kyle, and Daichi, who's only goal is to become the top fighters in the sport of Grapping.

The gameplay is similar to Elite Beat Agents, you have to hit certain points on the screen at a certain time to create a rhythm in order to fight your opponent.  You can unlock other characters or customize your own, each with their own abilities and special moves.

You can also play against a friend using the Nintendo WFC multiplayer.</desc>

		<path>./Dragon Quest Monsters - Joker 2 (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).zip</path>
		<name>Dragon Quest Monsters - Joker 2</name>
		<desc>Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker 2 gameplay follows closely to its predecessor. Players explore areas and tame wild monsters into their party. Monsters fight in turn-based combat and grow stronger. The battle system itself is very similar to previous Dragon Quest Monsters games. The player controls up to three monsters that make up the party, and can issue them direct orders or set them to one of 4 AI settings. This game features two new monster sizes: large monsters, which use up two spaces on one of the player's two benches, and gargantuan monsters, who take up an entire bench on their own. The main character, who is henceforth referred to as the Hero, does not directly participate in battles except for when the player uses items. He can, however, use any item in his possession and not just the ones 'in hand'. 311 monsters from the Dragon Quest games appear in Joker 2, with a few new species, many from the original "Dragon Warrior Monsters" games. This is the second game in the series to feature Wi-Fi support, after the first Joker game, and the first to support direct battling between players.
Square Enix released Joker 2 Professional, an expanded version of the game, on March 31, 2011. Professional features over 100 new monsters, as well as new regions and abilities, but the same story. Players are able to import their old monsters from the original game.</desc>

2. Hanenbow: These little creatures launch out of a small body of water and bounce off the leaves of plants. Depending on the levees they bounce off of they will create different sounds. 

3. Luminaria: You will have four plankton on a grid. Each has a different speed. Depending on what point on the grid they hit they will make a different sound. Arrows on the grid, that you can alter, will determine where they move. 

4. Sun-Animalcule: You place these little creatures on the screen and they will grow. As the become larger they will create different sounds. 

5. Rec-Rec:  Using the mic you can record four samples that then replay with various drumloops. 

6. Nanocarp: These little plankton move about the screen randomly, they will alter how they move according to what you input. Touching one will make it "pling" and clapping twice will make them swim in a circle. 

7. Lumiloop: You spin them around. They glow and make sound according to the direction and speed. 

8. Marine-Snow – Each of these plankton will make a tone when touched, and move about. 

9. Beatnes: Plays NES music and you can create repeating NES-esque music by touching the plankton on various parts of their bodies. 

10. Volvoice: This plankton will record you voiced and the play it back in different ways.</desc>

		<path>./Etrian Odyssey (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Etrian Odyssey</name>
		<desc>Far away in a vast fertile land lies a small town called Etria.  Peaceful and serene, Etria became famous when a labyrinth was discovered at the edge of its woods.  Those who heard of the labyrinth began to harbor dreams of exploring it.  And so many explorers from all over the world flocked to Etria in dream of achieving wealth, fame, and fortune exploring the vast and mysterious labyrinth.

Etrian Odyssey is a first-person RPG which pits you as an eager adventurer ready to face the dangers of the labyrinth.  At the beginning of the game you are required to create your own "adventuring guild" by creating various characters out of 9 different classes.  You can create as many as you want, but everything costs money, so strategic thinking is a must.  As well, you can only take a party of 5 into the labyrinth, so the remaining characters have to stay in town at the guild hall.  Battles are done in the traditional turn-based style, and he game contains over 125 monsters that guard the labyrinth and the area around it.  Movement is done one step at a time, with players moving in restricted directions (forward, back, left right).  Most of the game is focused on exploring deeper and deeper into the labyrinth while still returning to town in order to restock and resupply.  During the return trips to town, you can also switch out characters in your party if a special class is needed to pass obstacles in the labyrinth.  Also, players are only allowed to save during the return trip to town, making trips to the labyrinth both risky and exciting.

The labyrinth is completely unknown and unexplored, and so one of the important features of the game is the necessity to draw your own maps.  The top screen of the DS shows the action, while the bottom screen shows a gridded area.  In this area, you have to use the stylus to draw out all of your maps.  This means not only marking where the walls and doors are, but having to mark where enemies, treasures, special areas, and staircases are.  It is completely up to you how accurately or haphazardly you want to draw your map.  However, the only way to get out of the labyrinth is to return to the start, so the gameplay becomes even riskier the further you venture into the dungeon.  Managing your map poorly may risk you and party's lives.  Map making is a key concept of this game because it emphasizes adventuring into the unknown and finding out what's around the very next corner.</desc>

		<path>./Fantasy Aquarium by DS (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Fantasy Aquarium by DS</name>
		<desc>Fantasy Aquarium by DS is a fish tank simulation. Contrary to Aquarium by DS by the same developer, which is limited to "normal" aquarium suiting fishes, the player of this game can choose from 30 different underwater animals which can't be held in fish tanks in real life (e.g. whales, dolphins, sharks, penguins). Additionally, the player can customize their tank in size and add different backgrounds and accessories like plants, rocks or even buildings like the Leaning Tower of Pisa. New fish types can be unlocked by taking good care of the aquariums residents.

And that's the aim of the game, taking care of the fishes in the tank. They need to be fed, the tank has to be cleaned and water temp and salinity have to be adjusted to create a perfect environment. A wrong environment or an unsuitable mix of animals in the tank, for example killer whales and penguins at the same time, will result in the death of the players pets. Instead of swimming dead at the surface or bloody death animations they simply disappear from the screen. Not playing the game for a few days and therefore not feeding, will result in a deadly surprise, too.

Using the Wi-Fi-feature of the DS the player can swap fishes with other players.</desc>

		<name>Farm Frenzy : Animal Country</name>
		<desc>Slip into a pair of overalls and try your hand at running a farm! From tending to the fields where your cows graze to gathering eggs for sale at the town market, Farm Frenzy is as stimulating as the real thing-- only you won't have to experience the nasty smells! You will, however, be required to invest the money you earn in new equipment. Building a cheese dairy, for example, allows you to process your milk on the spot and make even more cash!nnTo beat a level in Farm Frenzy, you must complete a specific task, such as producing a certain number of eggs. Each new level is more challenging than the last, so you must increase the capacity of your warehouse and improve the performance of your production facilities. You can even buy a larger truck capable of delivering more goods to market! All of this makes dealing with the occasional bear easier. Featuring compelling and enjoyable gameplay, Farm Frenzy lets you give Old MacDonald a run for the money!</desc>

		<name>FIFA Street 3</name>
		<desc>FIFA Street 3 is the second entry in the FIFA Street series to appear on the Nintendo DS. The game takes football to the streets of numerous locations all around the world and features 18 international teams and a selection of more than 250 star players. The game can be played with either buttons, or the for the DS unique stylus control. Movement is done with the control pad, all other actions can be done with the stylus. Shooting is done by sliding the stylus towards the goal, while passes are made by touching in the direction of a team mate. When defending a slide is used for tackling. 

Doing tricks is a central part of the series and this DS iteration is no different with a number of different moves. These are done by combining different stylus slides. For each successful trick, the player is awarded trick points that increases his gamebreaker meter. Once full the gamebreaker can be triggered. The gamebreaker is a sort of quick time event where the player has to touch the touch screen when an icon appears. When successful this will lead to a goal. When the opposition gets a gamebreaker, the player can counter it by touching the screen faster. 

In addition to standard friendly matches the game also features a street challenge mode and a kick ups mode. In street challenge the player has to complete events to earn a reputation. To get a high reputation for the player not only needs to win, but to do it with a team with good chemistry so that the team performs as a group. By being successful in the street challenge the player earns unlockables. The kick ups mode is a rhythm action mini game where the player has to touch the screen in rhythm with the music. The game is also playable in multiplayer for two players through wireless connection.</desc>

		<name>Final Fantasy III</name>
		<desc>In 2006, Final Fantasy III reached North American shores in an official update/remake for the Nintendo DS, finally bringing all of the main Final Fantasy entries to the United States for the first time.

Raised as an orphan by Nina and Elder Topapa in the village of Ur, Luneth, his shy friend Arc, the rebellious Refia and the brave soldier Ingus are chosen as the Four Warriors of Light to send to restore balance to the crystals, and save the world from imminent destruction.

Taking the original game which debuted on the NES, Square-Enix had updated the title with a new cinematic intro, improved graphics and a touch-screen interface to move characters and utilize selection menus. There is also Moogle Mail, a Wi-Fi feature that allows players to send messages to each other via their DS systems. The game has also some revised story elements, detailing the adventures of four friends who find each other, each with new backstories.

Final Fantasy III is a traditional turn-based RPG, which were popular back in the '80s and '90s, but introduced refinements to the genre, such as smarter battle AI. Final Fantasy III is also known for two major milestones in the history of the series: Its introduction of the cheerful Moogles, as well as the introduction of the job system, allowing characters to switch professions throughout the game for new abilities.</desc>

		<desc>A second retelling of the original Fire Emblem on the Famicom, Shadow Dragon utilises the Nintendo DS online options in a first for the long running Fire Emblem series. 

The game offers a graphical enhancement from Ankoku Ry? to Hikari no Ken and Monsh? no Nazo, which was the first remake of the original, as well as utilising the dual screens on the Nintendo DS to display the action and character stats simultaneously.

The main story centres on prince Marth as he embarks on a quest to reconquer his home kingdom and rescue his kidnapped sister. Characters and chapters that were not present in the original have been introduced in this version, as well as some that were omitted for Fire Emblem: Monsh? no Nazo. Over twenty character classes are included in the game as well as over fifty individual characters to aid Marth.

Also included is the ability to save mid battle on special save point so a mistake in the last turn will not force a restart. Other features are the class swap for characters to change their abilities. Online battle features up to five characters per side in a two player battle.</desc>

		<name>Ghostbusters - The Video Game</name>
		<desc>Ghostbusters: The Video Game is a 2009 action-adventure game based on the Ghostbusters media franchise. The DS version of Ghostbusters: The Video Game uses the same stylized aesthetic as the Redfly Studios versions for the Nintendo Wii and Sony Playstation2 but was developed by Zen Studios. Rather than a third person chase camera perspective, the DS version uses a top-down perspective for most of the game. The story is the same as the other versions but the Ghostbusters receive side missions as well as story missions which they can use to boost the populace's opinion of them. Unlike the other versions in this there is no rookie character and the player takes control of the four original Ghostbusters one at a time while issuing commands to the other three. The money earned from missions can be used to buy new equipment and take part in the resource management aspect of the game. Also, between the game hub of the Firehouse &amp; the missions, there are driving segments which uses a chase camera perspective where the player takes Ecto-1 from location to location, catching ghosts along the way.</desc>

		<desc>Glory Days 2 takes the premise of Choplifter! and cranks it up a few notches. A strategic component was added that melds old gameplay with new game concepts. There are a lot of playable vehicles that become unlocked as you advance in the game.

The overall goal of the game is to provide air support for your ground troops as they advance and capture enemy bunkers, ultimately pushing them back enough that they retreat. Players can choose from three aviators and there are sixteen missions in total, moving on in time from classic WWII aircraft to modern day helicopters and F14's.

The strategical component allows the player to take command of ground units and manage funds to build new units. These funds are acquired by completing missions such as saving civilians or capturing bases. Progressively, more powerful units and weapons become available. Multiplayer is supported for up to eight players over Wi-Fi, split into two cooperative teams where the enemy's command centre needs to be taken out. The setup of the battles is completely customizable for different parameters.

Optionally, 3D glasses are supported to add more depth to the action on the screens.</desc>

		<name>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</name>
		<desc>Take on the role of Harry, Ron and Hermione as they begin their fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This year, the Triwizard Tournament takes place, and Harry is mysteriously entered into the tournament himself.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire for the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance is a top-down action/adventure game where you play as the three friends and progress through the story based on the book and film.

Make your way through various scenarios by attacking enemies and solving puzzles using spells. One button fires a ranged spell, such as Confoundus, while another is used for stream spells, like Wingardium Leviosa, which can be moved around with the Control Pad. You can also call your friends for added power to your magical spells.

The DS version includes a small bonus game where you take care of a magical creature called a 'Niffler'. It is a simulation game, like a very simple Tamagotchi. You can feed the Niffler, clean it, and give it toys - depending on what you do, it will become more or less pleased with you.  Perform well enough, and it will become really happy, and let you pat it to make it even happier.</desc>

The gameplay consists in various minigames, which you play either by pressing buttons on the right timing (GBA) or by doing different kinds of moves with your stylus on the touch-screen (DS).</desc>

		<name>Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure</name>
		<desc>Poppycock!  When the number one pompous adventurer, Henry Hatsworth, discovers a golden hat deep in the jungle, it makes him twenty years younger - but it also unleashes another world, releasing hordes of nasty monsters!  To top it off, the number two pompous adventurer, Weaselby, is one step ahead of Hatsworth - eager to snag up the remaining pieces of the Golden Suit and claim the number one position in the Pompous Adventurer's Club for himself!  Who can grab the suit, put Weaselby in his place, and seal up the other world, all before Tea Time?  Why, Henry Hatsworth, of course!

Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure is a hybrid of two styles of game - the top screen has an action-platformer starring Hatsworth, who must defeat enemies with his sword.  When he does, they fall down into the Puzzle Realm on the Touch Screen, which plays like Tetris Attack.  Players must match the block enemies up with other colored blocks to finally destroy them, before they rise up back to the top screen to harass Hatsworth once again.

Henry also has access to a super meter - by clearing blocks in the Puzzle Realm, he fills it up.  If he fills it up enough, it's Tea Time!  This means that Hatsworth can transform into superpowered steampunk robot that shoots lasers and missiles and is completely invulnerable, which is handy when the player is in a jam.</desc>

In Horsez the player plays Ginger, a young girl that receives a pony from a friend that leaves the country. Horsez is one of the Petz games that focuses mainly on training your pet in order to participate in competitions. As usual, there is also caring tasks like feeding, bathing, brushing, etc. so the pony grows healthy and strong, but the final goal will still be to train your horse in cross, jump and dressage and win at horse sport events worldwide. Other traditional elements of the series, like dressing your horse and Ginger for exhibition purposes or even toys when the player still owns a foal, also appear in Horsez.

As for the wireless gameplay, in addition to the usual sharing of pets with other game owners, there is also the possibility to send sick horses to the Imagine: Animal Doctor.</desc>

		<name>Hotel Giant DS</name>
		<desc>In Hotel Giant DS the player is responsible for managing a hotel. In principle the game is played similar to Hotel Giant 2 but adjusted to the capabilities of the platform. The first big difference is that there is no classic free playing mode but only 15 missions where the player needs to reach certain goals. Mostly the player takes over a half-finished hotel and needs to finish furnishing the rooms. The available items were reduced to the most necessary.

When the hotel opens its doors the most time is spent with attending to the cusomer's complaints. After beating a mission it can be played again with self-determined goals. The game is played in real-time but can be paused at any time. A save option is available after every day. There is also a mini game when the player doesn't want to hire cleaners: troubles are indicated with a flash on the mini map. When clicking on it the player needs to make a fast move with the stylus.</desc>

		<path>./Infinite Space (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Infinite Space</name>
		<desc>Growing up as a second class citizen on a back-water planet, Yuri dreamed of being able to travel the stars. After many years he saved up enough credits to buy transport off the planet, but space travel is forbidden to second class citizens, and he is chased by the security forces of the corrupt owner of the planet. To survive the dangers of space Yuri must become a captain, buy and customize star ships, and fight against hostile enemies both on the ground and in space.

The majority of Infinite Space's gameplay involves space ships, both in fighting and in modifying. All ships have a certain amount of space for extra modules to be added, and the abilities and shape of modules must be considered when choosing how to outfit a ship. In ship to ship combat you can control the distance your fleet is from the enemy fleet. During combat a command bar charges. You can use a small amount of the command bar to Dodge, use more to fire a Normal salvo, or expend almost all of it for a Barrage, which fires three times as many shots as Normal. If the opposing fleet uses Dodge before a Barrage then every shot will miss, leaving the attacking fleet at a disadvantage. If a Normal salvo is fired while the opposing fleet is Dodging, then every shot will hit and deal extra damage. Extra combat options come into play with larger star ships equipped with fighter hangars, special weapons, boarding parties, and officers with unique abilities.

The story progresses primarily with text dialogue and the occasional FMV. Sometimes the player is prompted to make a decision in dialogue for Yuri, and these decisions can have far reaching consequences. Additional officers can join Yuri through the story, by hiring them at a mercenary office, or by finding them on various planets. All officers have unique stats and abilities that make them better for a particular role, such as doctor, engineer, or pilot, than others, and these stats and abilities increase in level from combat.</desc>

		<path>./Iron Man (USA) (En,Fr,Es).zip</path>
		<name>Iron Man</name>
		<desc>Mostly based on the 2008 movie Iron Man, this videogame of the one-man-army hero has been released for seven different platforms. The NDS version, by A2M, is the most different one.

The game of Iron Man puts you under the skin of Tony Stark. He is a billionaire weapon-industrialist and genius inventor who, after being kidnapped by terrorists who want to force him to build weapons for them, builds an armor instead to escape. Since then, he decided to stop producing weapons and keeps on working on the suit to fight them back.

The games take the story further, giving the player the chance to go through 8 different missions, divided in by air and by foot missions, and even fight villains that do not appear on the movie, like Whiplash and Titanium Man. All this is shown through images between every mission, which use the voices of the actors of the movie like Robert Downey Jr. and Terrence Howard.

As for the game mechanics, by foot or by air, with the first armor at the beginning and in the characteristic red and gold suit later, using range weapons or melee attacks, the game features Stark fighting with armies of soldiers, tanks, helicopters, canons, etc. with the help of an array of upgradeable weapons like missiles, micro-grenades, repulsive shots, EMP blasts, a flame thrower and the powerful "Unibeam". Both the weapons and the suit (propulsion and armor systems) are upgradeable using the points that each mission regards you.

In the handling section, the next approach is used: move with a given set of controls, aim with another. In addition, there is also a button for repulsors (extra propulsion) to fly faster. The NDS touchscreen is used for aiming 360-wise, touching in a given direction from the center of the screen, and the pad is used for moving.</desc>

Each character controls differently and has a different role to play in the game, with War Machine able to use the touchscreen to blast foes from every angle, and Iron Man able to nimbly outmaneuver foes and use numerous weapon systems against mechanized opponents.

The game features a new story, separate from the events of the film, that pits Iron Man and War Machine against classic Marvel villains, such as Crimson Dynamo and Mandroid. The game also features numerous unlockable costumes and suits spanning decades of comic history.</desc>

		<name>Jam Sessions - Sing and Play Guitar</name>
		<desc>Jam Sessions is a reworked and localized version of the Japan-only DS title Hiite Utaeru DS Guitar M-06. It is a rhythm/music game, but rather than only offering musical challenges like other games in the genre, it can also be used as a tool - a pocket guitar. Simulating a guitar, the game part allows players to go through a list of famous songs. The chords are selected on the D-pad while the stylus is used to simulate strumming on the screen. Alternately, the L-button can be used to strum. The details are worked out thoroughly - speed and power change the sound, and downstrokes sound different from upstrokes. With only one strum string shown, only chord progression can be performed and no individual riffing or picking. The game does not punish players for not doing well, songs just keep on going regardless of the player's performance. There is a tutorial and warm up mode to get familiar with the controls.

As a tool, it allows players to compose their own songs and add a variety of effects. These include distortion, low cut, high cut, delay, chorus and flanger with extensive settings for each of them. These can be set invariably or made touch-specific. When using headphones or external speakers, the DS microphone can be used to sing along. Additionally, the DS can be plugged in to an amplifier via the headphone jack to output a more natural sound. A US re-release include a mini-amp in the package. Instead of using a stylus, pick-shaped variants were also made available.

In the top screen, players can add a metronome, guide bars and tab guides, along with different backgrounds and templates. Up to five different compositions can be saved.</desc>

The diamonds are hidden only to those who are too afraid to come here to Angola, too afraid of conflict. The local market has been soft ever since the biggest player went back to Johannesburg, but we still fly under the radar. We're made-up corporations with made-up names; we have no permanent employees and we work in temporary offices. These temporary offices though, are in the only places that matter for diamonds: Antwerp and London. There are only two firms left with agents in Angola, and we have until December before the UN starts regulating the sale of rough diamonds. Let's make these last 8 months count.</desc>

		<name>Jenga World Tour</name>
		<desc>Jenga World Tour is a take off of the popular board game in which you take blocks from the lower part of a block tower and set it on top without toppling it.  The premise is the same for the video game, using the Wii remote, you pull the blocks while moving the remote and using "A" button while using the "B" button to tap them out gently to keep the stack from toppling over.

There are several different backgrounds (in the pit of a volcano, medieval England, underwater, prehistoric times or even the Himalayan Mountain) you can play in, each having their own special differences, such as blocks freezing in the Himalayan stage or only being able to hold onto hot blocks in the volcano for a limited time or even avoiding catapults in the England stage.

There is also an arcade mode where you play a continuous game of Jenga or you can play against a friend in multi-player mode.  The Nintendo DS runs along similar lines, using the stylus pen to pull out and tap blocks out of place, but doesn't have the same levels as the Wii version, but does have the same kind of effects (i.e. ice blocks, cement blocks and even UFO attacks).  You can also play against a friend using Wi-Fi.</desc>

The Arena: Every boss that Kirby has met throughout the game, one after the other!  Try to beat them all!

		<path>./Knights in the Nightmare (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Knights in the Nightmare</name>
		<desc>A great war once raged across the land with many a valiant knight falling on the field of battle. In the end, the evil forces have prevailed, and have since taken over and corrupted the once great kingdom. On a stormy night a Wisp is awakened by a strange armored maiden. The wisp holds the memories of the war, and is now seeking all the valiant dead to be brought back to the world of the living in order to complete their mission and take back the land that was once theirs.

Knights in the Nightmare can be loosely summed up as a Strategy RPG, but it is played like no other Strategy RPG in existence. The game is almost entirely stylus controlled on Nintendo DS, and combines the active-timer turn-based combat of a game such as Final Fantasy VI with elements of bullet-hell top-down shooters, and relies on a set of unorthodox rules for completion of its goals.

Once in the field of battle the player controls the Wisp who can cause the spirits of fallen heroes inhabiting the area to temporarily reconstitute into their physical form and do battle with monsters that now roam the land. The player can recruit those warriors permanently into their party by seeking out objects that meant something to them while they were alive.

The game features a robust character customization system that includes many classes of units, multiple jobs per each unit class, and a soul transplant system that allows the player to transfer all attributes of one player into another.</desc>

In addition, the Nintendo DS version offers an addictive card game called "Five-Card Fu," which can be played either alone or with a friend. The game is played on a 3x3 grid which contains nine squares. To get started, the player must select five cards from their in-game library and place one card in one of the nine squares. Each card will have a number ranging from one through nine on each side of the card. In order to win, the player must strategize on which square they will occupy first as well as which card to use. Once the player places a card in a square, the opponent will have to place a card on an adjacent square that beats the numerical value of the card the first player placed. The player that occupies the grid with the highest numerical value wins.</desc>

		<desc>LOL is the ultimate party game that allows players' imaginations to run free. Since LOL has no rules, there's nothing to limit a player's creativity. The game's concept is simple; the host thinks up a challenge for the other players and then everyone battles it out by drawing, picking, or writing the best answer. When everyone has finished and submitted their answers, voting begins. The one with the most votes wins! Remember, if the game is boring, then you are boring!</desc>

		<name>Labyrinth</name>
		<desc>Labyrinth is the sequel to a SNES game called On the Ball.  The object of the game is to manipulate a ball through a maze to the checkered goal line.    To do this, players must rotate the level around to navigate their way through obstacles.  The ball is constantly falling towards the bottom of the screen, ignoring whatever direction the maze is facing.

There are two ways to control the ball.  The first is by using the L and R Shoulder buttons to rotate the maze left or right.  The other method is to rotate the maze map on the touch screen using the stylus.  Players can also briefly surround their ball with lightning which will shatter certain blocks.  It's also possible to customize your ball - you can increase or decrease the weight of your ball, as well as change the colour and material it is made from.

In addition to the single player mode, Labyrinth also features a Single-Cart Multiplayer mode.  In this mode, up to four players can take part in making their way through the maze.  The first player to reach the goal is the winner.</desc>

		<desc>Two of gaming's all-time classics are reborn on DS. Stories tell of a land of yore, now shrouded by centuries of time forgotten, called Ys. Despite its great knowledge, endless wealth, and bountiful prosperity, a sudden and unexpected cataclysm devastated the realm. Soon, its memory had faded completely from the minds of man. Centuries later, a young adventurer named Adol set sail to explore the world and leave his mark on history. During his travels, he learned of the tragic tale of Esteria, a once prosperous island now inexplicably engulfed by a crippling storm. Adol plotted a course for the besieged isle, curious to unravel the mystery... Available to North American audiences for the first time, this ultimate translation delivers the most substantial version of the famous Ys story ever made. Two games in one, Ys was released separately overseas, but North American gamers get them together. One of the longest-running, most beloved action RPGs of all-time, Ys has features exclusive to DS including 3D graphics, multiplayer, touch support, and more.</desc>

Kage and Chihiro are ninjas from the Iga village, and are sworn by their loyalty to do all they can to rescue her. They must face Yoshiro's endless demon ninja army on their quest across Japan.

As ninjas, Kage and Chihiro make use of a variety of ninja equipment and abilities. Kage uses katana and shuriken, while Chihiro uses a kusarigama (a chain with a blade on the end). Between stages, the player can arrange orbs they've collected on a grid to create different ninjutsu, or ninja magic. These have a variety of uses, including elemental attacks, damage reduction, and quicker attacks. New skills are also regularly learned, such as combination moves and new attacks, as well as increased jump height (in keeping with the absurd jumps the original game is known for).

After clearing the game, a hard mode is unlocked. There is also an art gallery featuring production illustrations, unlocked by meeting various conditions in the game.</desc>

		<desc>This addition to the LEGO video gaming library this time focuses on the fictional land of Chima, in which players must help Laval the lion embark on a journey to unlock the secret of the legendary Golden CHI Armor before Cragger manipulates its awesome power! 
 
The gameplay consists of guiding Laval and his friends through several locations (spanning 15 levels) including Lion Temple, Gorilla Forest, Croc Swamp and much more. Throughout the levels, players need to gather numerous studs, as well as special collectibles like Character Tokens, Character Biographies and Red Bricks (which unlock abilities in the Extras menu). 
 
The Touch Screens for 3DS and DS versions are utilised to change characters and accessing a map of the current level, while the gameplay occurs on the Top Screen. In contrast, the PS Vita displays all the action on one screen. 
 
Laval's Journey is the second entry in the LEGO Legends of Chima series, after Legends of Chima: Speedorz (available on the LEGO website and iOS).</desc>

		<name>LEGO The Lord of the Rings</name>
		<desc>The handheld Nintendo versions of LEGO The Lord of the Rings (based on Peter Jackson's film trilogy, and in turn based on J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy books) follow the same storyline as its home console cousins, where players must help Frodo Baggins and his friends travel from their peaceful home in the Shire to the perilous Mount Doom to destroy a powerful ring created by the antagonistic Sauron.

Like various LEGO games, players control a variety of characters using the control pad (as well as the 3DS Circle Pad) across several levels in an open-world environment, completing a set of quests along the way. Players also need to utilise special items like the Light of Eärendil, Elven rope and a wide arrange of weaponry to defeat several enemies (especially in the dark region of Mordor).

Unlike previous LEGO games, character biographies are also scattered throughout the levels that give players general summaries for each unique character. Red Bricks are also scattered and can unlock special abilities with the Extras menu.

While the slapstick humour is absent in these games, the 3DS and DS versions still retain the family-friendly approach as the home console versions.</desc>

		<path>./Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie Bbq</name>
		<desc>Fairy Tale Land faces its greatest crisis yet! A plague has swept through the population, turning former upstanding citizens into blood-crazed zombies.

Fortunately, the world's greatest adventurer and weapons collector, Little Red 'Ready To Rock' Riding Hood is still unaffected and is determined to uncover the source of the disease. She teams up with Momotaro, the boy who emerged from a peach in the Japanese folk tale, and the two set out on their quest. Red has her trusty machine gun and Momotaro has his ninja stars. They'll take down anything, living or dead, that gets in their way.

Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ is a classic, arcade-style vertical shooter for one player. The action is viewed from a high angle, with visuals taking up both screens of the DS. The game world is presented in 3D, as are bosses and various other enemies. However, the main character and standard zombies are 2D sprites.

The player's character (either Red or Momotaro, neither of whom has any obvious advantage over the other) is situated at the bottom of the lower screen and waves of zombies march toward her/him. The character automatically moves forward through the world, but the player can control left/right movement along a 2D plane, enabling them to move out of the way of obstacles, projectiles and zombies.
Touching the stylus to any point on the screen causes the character to shoot in that direction, and shots can be fired along the entire length of the play area (i.e. to targets at the top of the DS's upper screen).
The standard machine gun has infinite ammo, but must be reloaded, which simply means taking the stylus off the screen for a second. Along the way, there are other weapons to pick up - a shotgun, laser rifle and flamethrower (hence the 'BBQ' of the title). These special weapons have limited ammo, so must be conserved.
Players also start with a grenade launcher, which can be launched by double-tapping an area on the screen. Ammo is strictly limited, but can be replenished.

There are 21 levels, split over seven chapters. Each chapter is set in a different location based on a fairy tale or classic story and consists of two regular levels (fighting through hordes of zombies, as well as some mini-bosses) followed by a boss fight.

The boss fights are one of the game's main selling points, with varied and lengthy encounters against twisted, undead versions of Pinocchio, The Three Little Pigs, Santa Claus and others.

By completing the game on higher difficulty levels, new gameplay modes can be unlocked, including Boss Attack (defeat every boss in sequence) and Survival (timed battle against waves of zombies).</desc>

		<path>./Lock's Quest (USA) (En,Fr) [b].zip</path>
		<name>Lock's Quest</name>
		<desc>Lock's Quest is a strategy / action / adventure game, for the Nintendo DS, that follows the adventurous life of a young "Archineer" named Lock (An Archineer is a mix between an architect and an engineer). Lock's village is attacked by an enemy known as the "Clockwork." During the invasion, the story is set in motion when Lock's little sister, Emi, goes missing. Lock, his new friend Isaiah, and Lock's grandfather Tobias set out in search for Emi. Along the way, Lock joins the Archineers and Kingdom Force in hopes of defeating the Clockwork army and their leader Lord Agony.

The game play consists of two main modes of play: "Build Mode" and "Battle Mode." In Build Mode, the player has a limited amount of time to build defenses that will stand up against the approaching Clockwork army. Each defensive object costs a certain amount of "Source" (the game's currency). Many levels have protection objectives that the player must defend and prevent from being destroyed by the Clockwork. The player can build walls and gates of various material types (Wood, Stone, Metal and Spiked), unique "Turrets" that automatically fire at approaching enemies, "Traps" that can be placed in the battlefield and stationary "Helpers" that give nearby turrets specific buffs. Each player can develop a personal strategy that best fits his play-style based off of the current terrain and his choice of defences. New abilities, enemies and areas are constantly unlocked as the player progresses through the entire game.

Battle Mode begins when the Build Mode timer runs out, or when the player chooses to advance to the battle. The player is thrown into a real time battle and must defend the protection objectives for a certain amount of time while holding off the attack. Other objectives include: destroying specific groups of enemies, capturing enemy objectives, rescuing friendly characters and destroying boss enemies. The battles involve controlling Lock directly with the Stylus as the enemies attack. The player may engage the Clockwork enemies in mêlée combat. Doing so brings up various mini games which can increase Lock's attack damage or add a status effect, such as poison, to the Clockwork. Lock may also repair walls and turrets which have been damaged. This also brings up a mini game where the player must use the stylus in a back and forth "ratcheting" motion to fix the wall. Not only is the player able to control Lock directly, but he can move the camera independently from the character. This control scheme allows flexibility for the player to focus on repairing or attacking in one area, while looking at what's going on in another area.

Lock's Quest is broken into 100 Build and Battle phases called "Days," covering a wide variety of areas and scenarios. The story is advanced through interactive free roam areas, villages and cinematic cut scenes which take place in between the battles. Plot twists and character development becomes the vehicle for pushing the game forward after the initial game play techniques are taught in an interactive tutorial. A multiplayer feature is also present in Lock's Quest using the wireless DS multi-card play. In this mode, two players compete head to head in a mix of Build and Battle modes where the players can choose the paths and type of clockworks their opponent will face.</desc>

		<path>./Lunar Knights (USA) (En,Es).zip</path>
		<name>Lunar Knights</name>
		<desc>Many years into the future, a race of vampires have emerged, plunging planet Earth into darkness with an environmental control system called the 'paraSOL'.  They now control the planet, with humans living in fear.  When all hope seems lost, two boys with amazing power emerge to save the planet.  The Dark Swordsman, Lucian, and a rookie member of the vampire fighting 'Guild', Aaron.

Lunar Knights is an indirect sequel to the Boktai series of games, which takes place many years after.  Its focus is much more on action as opposed to stealth, although some stealth elements from the earlier games remain (for example, you can blow into the microphone to whistle and attract the attention of enemies).  Players control the two characters, Lucian and Aaron.  Lucian fights with a huge sword called 'Vanagand'.  As a result, Lucian has a close combat style.  Lucian uses the power of moonlight to fuel his special attacks and moves.

The other character is Aaron, a gunslinger for the Guild.  He fights by using sunlight to charge up his gun, the Knight, and shoot ranged shots at foes.  Aaron's special attacks and moves use up sunlight.  Both Aaron and Lucian can use junk materials to increase the level of their weaponry, giving them more power.

The main goal of the game is to make your way through the dungeons and purify the vampire at the end.  The dungeons themselves are fairly standard - you search for treasure chests, avoid traps and solve puzzles.  At the end, you'll fight a boss vampire, and once you've defeated them, the Casket Rocket will be called.  Because the vampires have blocked out the sun on Earth, you'll need to take the vampire into space to purify them.

At this point, the game becomes a touch screen controlled shooter.  To control the ship itself, you drag it around the screen with the stylus.  To shoot enemy ships, you tap them with the screen.  Once you reach the end, the vampire will be purified by the magnified power of the sun.</desc>

		<name>Magical Starsign</name>
		<desc>Magical Starsign is Role Playing Game about a group of students at the Will O’ Wisp magical academy. When their teacher mysteriously disappears they set out to find and rescue her. As she is on a different planet, this involves space travel. The player starts out alone, but one by one the classmates join the quest.

The students are each specialized in a different art of magic, linked to a starsign. As the planets move through the sky (as seen on the 'astrolog') the magic associated with that sign grows stronger and weaker. This applies to the monsters as well, which adds a strategic element to the gameplay. 

As characters grow stronger, they learn new spells. During combat, players tap on the attacks they want to use and then tap on an enemy to target. By tapping the character's head at the exact moment they release the spell, the attack is extra effective. 

There are two multiplayer options. The first, tag mode, allows players to exchange data with one another. In the magical rocket, an egg will hatch that will slowly develop into a new unique character. In the amigo dungeon mode up to six people can explore an 'amigo dungeon'.</desc>

Marbles will relentlessly roll across twisted tracks and into a hole in its center. When three same-coloured marbles touch each other, they destroy themselves. With the DS Stylus, players must shoot same-coloured marbles into the oncoming rows in order to prevent them from falling down the hole and thus clear a track. The twist is that now, marbles that share the same color will attract each other!

Magnetica takes advantage of the Nintendo DS hardware for precise touch-screen functionality and brings a new play mechanic to the famous puzzle. Test your ball-shooting skills in Challenge Mode, Puzzle Mode, Quest Mode and more.</desc>

		<name>March Of The Penguins</name>
		<desc>Based on the documentary March of the Penguins, this game follows the story of the emperor penguins as they embark on a long journey to breed their young. The game has been divided into twelve chapters, with different gameplay. The penguins need to be navigated through the environment, find a suitable mate, find food, take care of the egg, guard the young ones and finally make it all the way back.

A large part of the game is based on the concept of Lemmings. As the penguins march on, players need to help them land softly, melt obstacles, attract them in a certain direction using fish and place trampolines, ramps, slides, bridges and steps to make them access new areas. The levels can be explored using binoculars and the penguins need to collect a certain amount of snowflakes to pass. The penguins cannot die. When they fall off a cliff, they simply restart at the beginning of the level, but the players needs to bring them to the end as a group to succeed.

Other levels have the penguins slide down hills with faster gameplay, feature mazes, or take place underwater where predators need to be avoided while collecting food. In the later parts of the game, guarding the eggs adds an new layer of difficulty. As soon as a penguin hits an obstacle it is dropped. There is little time to pick it up again or it freezes. It also need to be taken to a warm spot before the thermometer time runs out.

Some educational content has also been included. Next to the habits, more information about the penguin migration in provided in between levels.</desc>

Players control Mario and Luigi simultaneously in the side-scrolling platform environment of Bowser's body, while also controlling the Koopa King himself in the top-down world of the Mushroom Kingdom. Similar to games like Earthbound, enemy encounters are seen as actual enemies that players can avoid or attempt to strike early. The actual battles are a combination of turn-based menu attacks, and timed reactions to enemies during battle. By watching the way an enemy reacts, you can anticipate their attack and avoid it or counterattack.</desc>

		<path>./Mario Hoops 3 on 3 (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Mario Hoops 3 on 3</name>
		<desc>Square and Nintendo reunite for a unique take on the basketball genre in Mario Hoops 3 on 3. Mario Hoops uses almost exclusively the DS stylus to play both offense and defense. Despite having all the moves you would expect from a basketball game the rules are quite different. Instead of 2-3 pointers. You collect coins along the ground which affect your score if you make a basket. Games can get on average up to 300 points.

On the offensive side you can tap the screen to dribble the ball, swipe in your teammates direction to pass, stroke up to dunk, and show your impressive ball handling skills by dribbling the ball in full 360 degrees around your character.

On the defensive side you can do everything from jumping, to stealing, to blocking. The game even allows for goal tending. This isn't your fathers basketball game.

Included in the game is the ability to rise through the ranks in tournament mode, play against your friends in multiplayer one on one,  and hone your skills in challenge mode. With over 15 courts, unlockable balls, and more than 18 of the most popular Mario and Square characters.

Playing tournament mode pits you and your team of 3 players up against 3 teams in a battle for the typical Mario style cups. While doing so new characters, courts, and balls will be unlocked all of which you can use in singleplayer or multiplayer.

There are two multiplayer modes. One of which is a race to see who can get 100 points by dribbling. This game is 4 player and supports DS download play. The main multiplayer mode is a 1 on 1 battle. Each player has 3 teammates and battles in two periods to see who can get the most coins.</desc>

		<desc>Master of Illusion is different from other exercise games. This one is a take on magic, teaching the player but also performing magic tricks against the player itself. There are three different modes including Solo Magic, Magic Show and Magic Training.

In Solo Magic, a magician performs parlor tricks such as  guessing what card the player has just picked out or guessing by the hand gestures the player makes over the DS screen.

In Magic Tricks, there are fourteen different tricks to try where the game is more of an assistant, helping the player out performing your tricks including having a friend pick out a card and drawing a face at the bottom of the screen that will guess the card picked out. It can also guess a person's birthday or where they are going on their vacation. Some of the tricks have the player recite different things through the microphone, for instance the vacation trick, or the player needs to blow into the microphone.

The third mode is called Magic Training, which is more of a series of mini-games to help test reaction speed. There are step by step instructions of how to perform tricks and there is also a special deck of cards that comes with the game.</desc>

		<name>Mega Man Star Force - Dragon</name>
		<desc>Mega Man Star Force introduces a new lead character, a boy named Subaru Hoshikawa, whose astronaut father has disappeared after a mysterious incident at the satellite station. Fond memories of spending time with his father have inspired Subaru's interests in the stars and what lies beyond. One day, Subaru heads to the observation deck and puts on a pair of "visualizer" glasses that had belonged to his father. These allow the wearer to see all the electric connections that exist between spaces. When he puts on these special goggles, a specific wave is triggered, summoning the presence of a mysterious alien life form named Warlock who had escaped from the planet FM. Dangerous creatures from that planet have come to attack Earth, so they must join together in order to defeat these menacing forces. Combining with Warlock enables Subaru to transform into Mega Man and enter the Wave Road. Features 2wo coexisting worlds – players can navigate the real world as Subaru and transform into Mega Man to travel across Wave Road. Three stellar versions call upon the power of the elements to offer distinct advantages: Pegasus – based on the water element, Ice Pegasus can instantly freeze an opponent with its special Ice Slash; Leo – turning up the heat, Fire Leo uses a special Flame Burner attack that can incinerate enemies in its path; Dragon – the ferocious Green Dragon draws upon the power of wood with a Wood Shot move that fires a cluster of razor sharp leaves to slash enemies to bits.</desc>

		<desc>As in the previous games, Mega Man Star Force 3 is a unique blend of an action and role-playing game (RPG), combining the high intensity combat that is the hallmark of Mega Man® games with Star Force’s strategic battle system. By defeating enemies and boss characters, players earn battle cards that enhance and evolve Mega Man’s abilities and attacks. New to Mega Man Star Force 3 are Noise Changes, random enhancements that change Mega Man’s form and unlock new abilities. The two versions of the game, Black Ace and Red Joker, each have over 100 unique Noise Types that can be combined with Mega Man to unlock elemental powers based on earth, air, water and fire. The new Noise feature will add an exciting randomness to battles, encouraging players to explore, collect and battle across the digital world of Mega Man Star Force 3. In Mega Man Star Force 3, players travel between the physical world and the digital world via electromagnetic waves that form wave roads. Geo Stelar, the protagonist of the game, can see these wave roads by using his unique visualizer tool. Once in the digital world, Geo can merge with the electronic life-form known as Omega-Xis to become Mega Man. The wave roads are being overrun by mysterious noise that change the player’s environment and powers in different ways. This noise is being generated by an approaching gigantic meteor that threatens both the physical and digital worlds of Mega Man Star Force 3, forcing Geo Stellar and his crew to fight the oncoming threat to save two worlds. Fortunately, Mega Man discovers that he can control the Noise, using the new Noise Change system to transform into many different forms, including the ultimate Black Ace or Red Joker forms.</desc>

		<path>./Mega Man ZX (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Mega Man ZX</name>
		<desc>Many years after the events in the Mega Man Zero series, humans and Reploids (humanoid robots) have at last found peace.  Two humans, Vent and Aile, work for a delivery company called Giro Express.  After being ambushed during a delivery, they come in contact with something called 'biometal', which transforms them into the Maverick Hunter, X.  Using their new powers, they decide to work for a group called "The Guardians", who protect civilians from Maverick attacks.

Mega Man ZX is a side scrolling platformer for the Nintendo DS.  While the gameplay is similar to the Mega Man X series, in that you find powerups to increase your health meter, gain subtanks to store surplus energy when needed, and gain new abilities such as swimming and flight through acquiring boss powers, the art style is more similar to the Mega Man Zero series of games.

As players progress through the game, they gain the power of different types of "biometal", which gives them robotic weaponry and abilities.  Different situations require different biometal suits, and sometimes (such as in civilian areas), it's best to return to your human form so that you can make your way through areas without being hassled.  New models of biometal can be acquired from boss enemies.  While you can hit their weak spots for more damage, it's actually beneficial not to, as the more damage you do to the weak spot results in more repairs that you need to make to the biometal later.</desc>

From using your sharp analytical skills to solve a mystery, to putting your life on the line in an intense shoot-out, or shaking down the bad guy; a detective's life truly seems like life on the edge. Now, Hudson is set to give you a taste of that life with Miami Law, an all new adventure on Nintendo DS that has you saving the world with your fingertips! Miami Law is an action-adventure game packed with all of the ingredients of a prime-time TV show: an intricate storyline with a shadowy terrorist conspiracy, furious shoot-outs in abandoned warehouses, challenging crime-scene detective work and more. Players will have many opportunities to choose their path and change the story - either as the intense Law Martin from the Miami PD or the brainy Sara Starling from the FBI. Players are presented with different challenges depending on which character they pick - playing as Sara features a puzzle-based element, whereas playing with Law thrusts the player into the action, often into car chases or shoot-outs where taking out the bad guys is the only way to get results. Unlockable extras, including Texas Hold 'Em Poker and Sudoku, are included to take the pressure off players when the tension gets thick.</desc>

Letting you loose with hundreds of vehicles, each with distinctive performance abilities, you'll be racing your inch-long miniature motors on the wildest tracks where everyday household objects appear immense in size and can become lethal hazards. Sport cars, street racers, stock cars, 4x4s, beach buggies, lowriders and muscle cars are just some of the Micro Machines models you'll be taking out on the improvised tracks around the Micro Machines house, garden and - for the first time - beyond. Spin out around the breakfast table littered with cereal spills, tear through the kitchen but avoid literally burning tyre rubber on the blazing hot cooker, turbo boost around the pool table (while avoiding the treacherous pockets), or hit the gas as you drive around the rim of the bath, carefully negotiating the ferocious waters pouring over the edge of the bath (because someone left the tap running).</desc>

		<desc>Renegade Kid returns to the DS with this second game, Moon. After updating the Renegade Engine, used for the first game, Dementium, this new shooter for the DS puts you in the role of Major Edward Kane, Chief of Military Operations for the Extra-Terrestrial Encounter Organization. The year is 2058 and you and your squad are sent to the moon to investigate strange things that have been happening at the new moon bases. An alien hatch has been discovered at the construction site of one of the bases. So you need to take charge and take care of business.

As its predecessor, it tries to fill the lack of shooters for Nintendo's handheld. With the stylus for aiming, the D-pad for moving and the shoulder buttons for shooting, Moon revisits the late 90's style of shooter started by the Quake series.

The game features 24 episodes, 7 different weapons, various levels of difficulty, bonuses and other game modes to unlock.</desc>

After the comet had passed, the scientists concluded that the strange, green dust had no effect on the world. No one noticed that tiny plants and fungi were acting strangely. Mushrooms, cacti, flowers and vines had awakened to full consciousness. Tribes quickly formed, building plant and fungi nations and with nation building... came war! 
Mushroom Men: Rise of the Fungi takes you through the events leading up to the Spore Wars as a three inch high Mushroom Man. As one of three classes of mushrooms players experience a world larger than life and prepare for a tiny war of epic proportions.</desc>

The Rider Reflex control system provides unparalleled precision and fluidity by separating machine steering from body positioning, which allows the independently controlled rider to shift his weight, perform death-defying stunts and avoid potentially devastating wrecks. Unprecedented terrain deformation creates ever-changing courses as off-road vehicles carve lines and deep ruts that have a real-time impact on gameplay and remain persistent through the full length of each race.</desc>

It also features Crash Camera, a super slow-mo breakdown of accidents and crashes, similar to MotorStorm.

Some mini-games have been included as well, including ATV hockey, Monster Truck Smash and Tag to name a few. The online mode has the player compete against other competitors. The gameplay is very similar to the console systems, certain buttons for gas, brakes while the Wii remote can be used as well.

While the DS has few vehicles and only has a championship mode unlike the many series in the major console versions, it contains ten exclusive tracks and three stadiums. The PSP version is almost similar, but has different series from the consoles: Race, One on One, Time Attack, Stunt Challenge, Stunt Race, Hang-Time, Combo Challenge, Flag Challenge. It also has the X-Cross tournament, but it is named the MX vs. ATV World Tour instead. Games can be played against friends using Wi-Fi.</desc>

However, only one young man catches Elise's eye, and, as it turns out, he is no prince, but an adventurer.

		<name>Myst</name>
		<desc>You have just stumbled upon a most intriguing book, a book titled Myst. You have no idea where it came from, who wrote it, or how old it is. Reading through its pages provides you with only a superbly crafted description of an island world. But it's just a book, isn't it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your hand on a page. Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with the island world the pages described. Now you're here, wherever here is, with no option but to explore.

Myst is a first-person point-and-click adventure where the player controls a character known as The Stranger. Magically transported into the world described in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its mysteries. The game is presented as a series of static scenes where the player acts with the environment by clicking and manipulating objects. There are no enemies and it is not possible to die. Through Myst Island, the game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books.

The PSP version adds new adventure scenarios and includes widescreen support.

The DS version includes a completely new age, the Rime Age, and, next to a code rewrite, includes new and re-mastered sound effects and video clips.</desc>

		<name>N+</name>
		<desc>N+ is an enhanced version of the game N, originally a flash based browser game. Players control a small, but very agile ninja through different small areas. Next to movement, only a single button is used to jump, but this allows the ninja to run up walls, do wall jumps and cross large distances.

Levels are divided over different episodes unlocked gradually. Each level consists of a single screen with a time limit. The amount of time can be replenished by collecting golden coins, but the main goals is to activate the exit, usually by touching a specific button or opening a number of doors. Areas are filled with hazards such as spikes and droids that shoot laser or rockets. There are also obstacles such as platforms that only move in a single direction or falling damage from high platforms. Death is always instant, but the player is given an unlimited amount of tries.

The PSP version includes a mix of original levels and user-created ones with about 200 in total. There is also a level editor and unlike the Xbox 360 version these can be shared with other players. The PSP version shows the levels from a "medium" distance, while the DS version contains a far view and a close view on the screens. Physics are also slightly different in each version.

There are both competitive and cooperative game modes available in multiplayer sessions. Players can switch between the pure mode with original graphics and the plus mode with enhanced visuals. The unlockables includes victory screens, new music and new colours for the ninja.</desc>

Players unlock features (concept art, backgrounds etc.) by fighting through an adventure mode, which in turn allows finished levels to be played in arcade mode, which is purely for attaining high scores. High scores in arcade mode can be logged on the games official site for ranking against other players around the world.

Adventure mode also allows players to tackle missions in non linear order, however all three in one group must be finished before the next three can be attempted and so on.

The touch screen is used for current status and to scan the end of level bosses for weaknesses.

Challenge modes are added when adventure levels are completed, allowing players to play through the game with a set of restrictions, making high scores more difficult, but increasing the challenge and lastability of the game.

Two players can fight competitively to get the highest score before a timer ends or be the first to reach a certain predefined limit of points.

The game supports single cart play for multiplayer so only one copy is needed.</desc>

Players can activate special attacks using the Nintendo DS stylus on the touch screen or by blowing into the microphone. Just like a true ninja, in NARUTO: Ninja Council 3, players will have to protect, defend or defeat as they train hard to perfect their skills in order to progress through the ranks in over 40 missions ranging in difficulty from moderate to challenging. Up to four players (wireless) can choose from over 20 different characters with four different playing modes including Timed Mode, Scroll Collection Mode and Head-to-Head Versus Mode.</desc>

		<path>./Nervous Brickdown (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).zip</path>
		<name>Nervous Brickdown</name>
		<desc>At its core Nervous Brickdown is a Arkanoid-clone and the first ten levels feature the familiar gameplay of using a horizontally moving paddle at the bottom and a ball to destroy bricks at the top of the screen. But each of the ten worlds (divided into 9 levels and one boss fight) feature a different type of gameplay.

In the second stage the player needs to draw the paddle on the screen himself to knock the ball against ink blots. Depending on the form of the drawn paddle, the ball will bounce off differently. And to spice things up even more, the paddle isn't restricted to just horizontal movement anymore but can instead be freely moved around at the bottom of the screen. Other stages require the player to move through a haunted house and kill ghosts by blowing into the microphone or contain a laser beam which increases it's speed. 

By playing successfully through the levels, the player unlocks bonuses which range from extra lives to the ability to change the trajectory of the ball by blowing into the microphone.

The game also features a multiplayer mode for two players in which the ball changes into the player's paddle color so it will only bounce off the paddle with the corresponding color.</desc>

		<desc>This action-adventure title is presented in a third person, pseudo-3D manner, meaning all the game-models are rendered in full 3D, but the world the player travels around in is pre-rendered. When played, the Nintendo DS is held sideways, as in Hotel Dusk: Room 215 and Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!. The left screen shows the area map, while the right displays the main gameplay, when set for right-handed play, and reverse when set for left-handed play.
Set six months after Ninja Gaiden, Ryu Hayabusa has rebuilt the Hayabusa Village. When fellow villager and kunoichi, Momiji, is kidnapped by the Black Spider Ninja Clan, he is forced to find her, while uncovering the secrets behind the mysterious Dark Dragonstones and their relation to the Dragon Lineage</desc>

		<name>Ninjatown</name>
		<desc>Ninjatown is a family-friendly tower defense game for the Nintendo DS that features the artwork and characters of ex-EGM editor Shawn Smith's "Shawnimals" universe. In the game, players must build Ninja Huts at key spots along a set pathway to defend each of the game's 36 levels from the invading forces of Mr. Demon. Players can build up to eight different kinds of Ninja Huts, each kind containing its own category of Ninja, from Wasabi pea-shooting Sniper Ninjas to bearded Mountain Ninjas. 

There are also a variety of "Ol' Master Ninja Powers" that can help the player in a pinch. These range from blowing into the DS microphone to push enemies backwards with a gust of wind to tapping enemies on screen in a short period of time in order to deal extra damage to them.

The game is divided into 9 "districts", each containing 3 standard tower defense maps and 1 boss map. Each level in the game takes about 10-15 minutes to complete, with the full game clocking in at around 6-8 hours.</desc>

		<name>Nintendogs: Chihuahua &amp; Friends</name>
		<desc>Players care for and train their puppy by petting it, walking it and buying it supplies to play with. As a puppy competes in obedience and agility trials, owners can win money to purchase other puppy breeds. The pups will vary in gender, coloration and personality. Players purchase one of several breeds available at the beginning, then start spending time with their pup. They throw flying discs and balls to improve the pup’s agility, bathe it when it gets dirty and use their own personal voice commands to train the dog to do tricks. If players train it well enough, they will excel in obedience and agility trials and disc competitions, which will earn money that they can use to buy other supplies and puppy breeds. When players earn enough cash, they can buy even more puppies to live with their original pup. Players can socialize their pups by walking them around the town, where they will meet neighborhood dogs, and maybe even find new toys. Trips to the park and gym offer valuable training time to prepare for agility trials and disc competitions. Over time, the pup's stamina will increase so players can explore farther and farther. Players also can interact wirelessly with their friends' Nintendogs – they can set their DS to bark whenever another puppy is within wireless range.</desc>

Ōkamiden shares many gameplay elements with its predecessor, including the paintbrush used as a weapon against enemies and for puzzle solving. Chibiterasu can also team up with various companions during the game for additional abilities.</desc>

		<desc>Onpu Island is an island populated by musical spirits called Ontama. These strange, multicolored creatures can allow skilled performers, called 'Ontamaestros', to perform music by gathering Ontama. Beat and Rest, two young friends from a small village on the island, find an Ontama on the street. They discover that the Ontama are being captured, and so they set out to find out what's happening to them, and to become Ontamaestros themselves.

Ontamarama is an action rhythm game that makes full use of the DS' capabilities. Ontama appear on the screen, and can be tapped, tossed, and circled. Clearing an Ontama makes fills a note on the bar along the top of the screen, and when the note reaches the end of the bar, the correct button must be pressed to play the note. There are four different colored Ontama, and you also need to watch out for the white and black ones which can help or hinder you in other ways!

The game includes a story mode, a tutorial mode, a free play mode where you can play songs cleared in the story mode, and a challenge mode. There is also a shop where you can buy songs and items with points acquired during the game.</desc>

		<path>./Open Season (USA) (En,Fr,Es,Nl).zip</path>
		<name>Open Season</name>
		<desc>Open Season is based on the Sony Pictures Animation's CG animated film of the same name, where a rowdy brood of forest animals turn the tables on a bunch of unsuspecting hunters.  

The game is a side-scrolling-puzzle adventure. The plot of the game is to complete puzzles and avoid traps to advance from level to level.  Every level completed will raise your friendship with the different animals of the forest.  Once friends, these animals can be used as allies to attack and defeat the hunters encountered along the way.

Following the plot of the movie, once the player has become friends with a sufficient amount of animals, he can then take on the evil hunter leader Shaw.

The gameplay loop is to find clever ways to solve puzzles that prevent you from moving forward in a level.  To solve these puzzles, the player can switch between the two main characters : Boog, a 900 pound bear and Elliott, a crazy deer.  Both characters have their specific skills which need to be wisely used to progress through the levels.  To solve most of the puzzles, Boog and Elliott, each controlled individually and seperately, will have to work as a team.

To complicate the gameplay a bit, the player will encounter hunters on the way which he can defeat "using" the now friendly skunks, beavers, squirrels...  which all have their unique skills.

This game is a 2,5D side-scrolling game with an emphasis on spatial puzzles. The story mode contains 27 levels. In addition, there's also eight minigames.</desc>

		<desc>Orcs &amp; Elves is a turn-based role-playing game based on improved DOOM RPG engine. The story follows an elf named Elli who, along with a talking magic wand Ellon, heads to the depths of a devastated dwarven citadel to find out what happened there, battling foes of many kinds, finding mysterious items and meeting various people.

The game uses a first person perspective and dungeons are grid-based, similar to the Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder series; the player can only move between squares, forward, backward, strafe left or right, turn in 90 degree increments. Enemies and dungeon features are drawn with sprite graphics. There are some 3D objects in the dungeons as well, and the game employs some 3D camera movements in the cutscenes. The dungeons mostly consist of one level, though it is possible to move between different parts of the dungeons and revisit the previous dungeons as necessary.</desc>

		<name>Over the Hedge</name>
		<desc>A portable adventure game based on the animated movie of the same name and which chronicled the adventures of a group of animals in their struggle against a recently-built housing development.

Playing as either RJ, Hammy or Verne you'll have to complete several incursions into the human dwellings to steal food, supplies and sabotage further housing developments.

Gameplay-wise the game is a 3rd-person perspective stealth-adventure hybrid in which you must navigate through several houses looking to retrieve your current objective while avoiding the many traps set by the homeowners (as well as the homeowners themselves). To get by you can make use of several unique items that allow you to set up diversions, or create them yourself by blowing into the microphone. Each character has individual strengths and weaknesses and in many missions you'll have to alternate between each character to successfully complete the level. 

As a unique feature the game displays the standard 3rd person perspective on the top screen while the lower screen features a top-down view which allows you to better scan the levels for traps and items, both rendered with fully polygonal graphics.

Features a single player campaign and a wireless multiplayer mode with a two-player mode in which two players compete to clear out a level of food.</desc>

In Overlord Minions, the Overlord commands the Minion team remotely. The Nintendo DS stylus becomes an extension of his evil will and every precise Touch Screen command is the player-as-Overlord directing, commanding and combining minions in battle, pointing and sweeping them to attack enemies and solving puzzles to execute his dastardly plans. Controlling the Special Farces team of four, players negotiate fiendish levels and take on a huge range of warped enemies to hunt down the Kindred, a cult dedicated to resurrecting the mighty Dragon Kin, a race of humanoid dragon hybrids, determined to replace the Overlord's despotism with their own. Extending the Overlord series' trademark humour, gameplay focuses on the mischievous physical comedy of the minion's antics and is delivered in a stylised cartoon visual style.</desc>

		<desc>In Paws &amp; Claws Regal Resort, players can mix business with their love for animals by building and managing the finest pet resort while also caring for guests' pets. In the game, players can expand their resort with six types of animals - dogs, cats, horses, hamsters, birds, and rabbits - and optimize their experience by feeding, bathing and exercising the animals. As a resort becomes more popular, upgrades will be necessary to keep the animals happy, so players will need to venture into town to purchase supplies. If players are too busy caring for the animals and cannot go to town for supplies, they can read up on facts about each animal and take quizzes in order to unlock upgrades for the resort.</desc>

		<desc>Dogz 2 is the sequel to the Nintendo DS Dogz, a title of the Nintendo DS Petz series.

Differently to the traditional pet games, the focus of Dogz 2 is in the 18 mini-games, seven of which are card games that can be played in multiplayer, like blackjack and memory games, which will give the player goodies, like furniture and toys and costumes for the dogs and even more rooms of the house, after completed or won.  There are 11 different breeds (like dalmatian, beagle or poodle) to choose from this time and 250 different items to fill the house with.

There is no pet caring in Dogz 2, but there is still plenty of interaction with them. Many of the collectibles may produce a reaction on the dogs. The player can also make his/her puppies to wear costumes and even give them 14 different oral orders through the microphone of the DS.</desc>

		<desc>The second game in the popular court room battle series from Japan introduces four new cases featuring new characters, plot twists and gameplay features. Players resume the role of Phoenix Wright, a defence attorney who must prove his client’s innocence against the toughest of odds and most ruthless of adversaries. Players must exercise their legal prowess as they collect evidence, examine witnesses, analyse testimonies and seek the truth to ensure that justice prevails. New "Psyche-Lock" feature – some witnesses may be keeping the truth under tight lock and key, so in order to break them down, successfully open up their Psyche- Locks with a series of correct questions or catch them on their inconsistent testimony. New life bar represents Phoenix’s status in court – by presenting incorrect evidence or following misguided attempts to break Psyche Locks, Phoenix’s life bar will go down; the only way to regain this stat is to successfully open a witness’s Psyche-Lock. Colourful cast of characters include both new &amp; familiar faces: Franziska von Karma – the new D.A. and daughter of former adversary, Manfred von Karma, is on the warpath to take Phoenix down and avenge her father by any means necessary; Maya Fey – having honed her psychic powers, she is now a mystic of the Kurain Channeling Technique and will continue to be a valuable ally for Phoenix in his trials; Pearl Fey – Maya’s cousin is an up and coming psychic herself and looks up to her as a role model.</desc>

		<path>./Picross DS (USA) (En,Fr,Es).zip</path>
		<name>Picross DS</name>
		<desc>Picross DS is a touch screen-based puzzle game for the Nintendo DS.  By following the numbers on the left and top of the game grid, players can uncover the picture hidden away.  The rules are simple - if there is one number on a line, say, 10, then you know that there are ten squares in a row that must be chipped away on that line.  If the numbers read something like 2 7, then you must chip away two squares somewhere in the row, separated by at least one empty square, and then seven squares to be chipped away.  By applying these rules horizontally and vertically to the grid, you can work out the picture using logic.

There are two methods of control: you can use the Control Pad to move a cursor, the A Button to chip a square, the B Button to mark it, and the X Button to zoom in or out (similar to Nintendo's previous Picross games).  Alternatively, you can use the stylus to play.  In this mode, the Control Pad changes the functions of the stylus.  When you press Up, you'll chip squares, Down will mark them, Left will zoom in and out, while Right allows you to scroll.  The buttons on the right of the DS perform the same functions, which is helpful if you're left-handed.

Picross DS has a variety of different modes:

1.  Picross - This is standard Picross.  Play through easy, medium and difficult puzzles, or learn how to play.  You are penalized with time for any mistakes you make in easy and medium modes.  In difficult, your mistakes are not noted at all.

2.  Daily Picross - Play a quick set of five Picross puzzles, once a day.  Each day, your score is added to a chart, so you can track whether you're improving or getting worse, similar to Brain Age.

3.  My Picross - Design your own Picross puzzles by drawing on the grid.  When you're done, you can play your puzzles, or send them to others.

4.  Competition Picross - Play Picross against others in this mode.  You can choose to use single-cart multiplayer, multi-cart multiplayer, or online play via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.

You can also download additional puzzle packs for Picross DS by using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, including puzzles from Mario's Picross.</desc>

		<desc>Alfonso Senior, having made his fortune from the original Pipe Mania, has retired to Paradise Island. Unfortunately, the island has an alarmingly high number of plumbing-related problems. Alfonso's retired, but he's called in his kids Junior and Fawcett to fix up the island, and maybe learn a few things about plumbing along the way.

Gameplay is similar to the classic Pipe Dream/Pipe Mania, but with a more mission-based structure, and more unusual modes. Missions can be replayed to get a higher grade, and high grades can unlock various treasures, such as movies, character bios, and new game modes. Pipe Mania even has a multiplayer mode; compete against a friend for points, or use your attacks to damage your opponent's pipes.</desc>

		<desc>Planet 51 is a galactic sized alien adventure comedy from the writer of "Shrek" and "Shrek 2", the story revolves around American astronaut Captain Charles "Chuck" Baker who lands on Planet 51 thinking he's the first person to step foot there.

With the help of his robot companion "Rover", and his new friend Lem, Chuck must navigate his way through the dazzling, but bewildering, landscape of Planet 51 in order to escape becoming a permanent part of the Planet 51 Alien Invaders Space Museum.

		<path>./Platinum Sudoku (USA) (En,Fr,Es).zip</path>
		<name>Platinum Sudoku</name>
		<desc>Platinum Sudoku offers 20 million Sudoku puzzles (in five levels of difficulty), over 300 Kakuro puzzles and a number of mini-games. The game starts with a tutorial mode and the twenty million puzzles will only be available to you after completing 100 puzzles in Easy, Medium or Hard mode. Solving all puzzles in Hard mode unlocks the Pro mode, solving the Pro puzzles unlocks the Sudoku X mode. New background graphics, fonts, grid styles and music are also unlockable.

The object of Sudoku is to fill a square grid measuring 9x9 spaces, further divided into nine 3x3 squares with the numbers 1 to 9. Each horizontal row and each vertical column can only contain each number once, and this also applies to each of the square grids. Each grid already contains a few numbers, how many depends on the level of difficulty. The game layout can be switched around for left-handed players by choosing an option from the menu.

Filling the grid is done by either drawing the desired character directly onto the grid on the Touch Screen, by pointing to that number on a small grid or by using the D-pad. Several numbers can be entered in one cell in Draft mode. When the player has deduced which number is the only one possible, the choice is made definitive. It is possible to ask for hints, but these cost "coins" that have to be earned by solving puzzles. Hint A gives some possible numbers for the current cell, Hint B provides the correct number for the current cell, and Hint C scans the whole board and marks cells as right or wrong. It is also possible to choose several assisting features from the game menu, for instance highlighting the current row or column, highlighting the "easiest to solve" cells or automatically filling the grid with all possibilities for each cell.

Kakuro puzzles are like crosswords except the grids are filled with numbers. The grid consists of black and white cells. The white cells must be filled with numbers, the black cells contain the clues. Each entry can only contain a number (between 0 and 9) once and the sum of the numbers must match the clue. For example if the clue is "11" and the entry is three cells wide, the solution could be "1, 6, 4" or "2, 5, 4" but not "2, 7, 2".  

The mini-games included in Platinum Sudoku are Subtract (drop numbers unto others to subtract them until you reach zero), Pair Match (draw lines between pairs of numbers), Shuffle (slider puzzle), Choice Block (find the missing number), High Sum (choose the block with the highest sum) and Mine Detector (mine sweeper). If a challenge is met, the game is unlocked in the menu and you can try to improve your high score.

Two players can play co-op to solve a grid together or compete to see who is the fastest in solving a grid. Finally there is a Custom Grid mode which allows you to design your own puzzles.</desc>

		<path>./Pokemon - HeartGold Version (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Pokémon: HeartGold Version</name>
		<desc>Pokémon HeartGold is an enhanced remake of one of the second installments in the Pokémon Main RPG Series, Pokémon Gold.

Set in the region of Johto, the player controls a new Pokémon Trainer on his/her way to meet up with Pokémon Researcher Professor Elm at his lab to receive his/her first Pokémon. While running an errand for Elm, the player returns to find that a thief has stolen one of the professor's Pokémon. This event starts your quest to becoming a Pokémon master, leading you through the region of Johto and later Kanto, to battle the mysterious Team Rocket and capture all 493 Pokémon. 

Along with retaining most of the original game's features, HeartGold contains quite a few new updates. Like Gold the story will incorporate the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh (who can be seen on the game's box art), although this time in a bigger fashion. Graphics have been upgraded to 3D models to resemble the series previous Nintendo DS iterations, Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum. The ability to have any one of your Pokémon following you on the Overworld Screen which was limitedly seen in Pokémon Yellow has been added. 

Included with the game is a peripheral known as the Pokéwalker. Acting as a pedometer, the Pokéwalker allows you to wirelessly transfer a Pokémon from HeartGold to it. When there is a Pokémon in the Pokéwalker it gains "experience points" for each step you take. The player also earns a form of money known as "watts", which is used to help catch other Pokémon and buy items.

The game is compatible with the following games via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection: Pokémon SoulSilver, Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum.</desc>

		<name>Pokemon - Platinum Version</name>
		<desc>Together with Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl, this game is the 3rd games in the 4th generation of the Pokémon series. Set in a new region, Sinnoh, it includes 107 new Pokémon, bringing the total up to 493. Pokémon Platinum includes for the first time in the 4th generation, the Battle Frontier which can be played on and off-line, make Poffins on-line. Players can collect badges, challenge the Elite Four, and become the ultimate Pokémon master.

The game continues the basic idea of previous Pokémon games - the player, a new trainer, sets out on a quest to catch every known Pokémon and defeat the Pokémon league. Along the way, the player will attempt to foil the plots of the evil organization, Team Galactic, who seek to use a trio of legendary Pokémon to awaken a sleeping titan with the power to control space. There are many sidequests and other activities along the way, the Battle Frontier, expanded on-line options, downloadable content via Mystery Gift, a brand new GTS with the option to receive notifications of completed traded over the Wii, record battle videos, the option to submit one's Pokémon party data for others to see and the Distortion World, which defies the laws of gravity and contains Platinum's mascot, Giratina.

The core Pokémon series features an RPG turn-based battle system. Each monster can learn up to four attacks. In a single turn, the two opponents select their attacks, and the one with the higher Speed attacks first. The amount of damage is influenced by the Attack and Defense stats. In the past, attacks were automatically classified as Physical or Special based on their elemental type. In Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum each attack can be individually categorized, so attacks which use natural elements are Special, and those which use simple force are Physical.

The Pokémon Contests from Ruby and Sapphire return, with many new features. In addition to the attack performance, where the player must try to impress the judge with flashy moves, players will also dress up their Pokémon and dance in time to music. Diamond and Pearl also bring back the real time system from Gold and Silver, where day and night are reflected in your game. Some Pokémon are only catchable during certain times.</desc>

		<desc>Pokemon Black Version and Pokemon White Version feature new Pokemon that players can catch, train and battle as they progress through the game, and some Pokemon can only be caught in one version of the game. For example, the Legendary Pokemon Reshiram can only be caught in Pokemon Black Version, while the Legendary Pokemon Zekrom can only be caught in Pokemon White Version. Additionally, the two games feature different areas for the first time in the series, with the game world of Pokemon Black Version featuring a unique metropolitan area called Black City, and a lush, green area named White Forest only found in Pokemon White Version. Pokemon Black Version and Pokemon White Version also mark the first time in a Pokemon video game that the seasons will change in the game world. Certain Pokemon appear more frequently during different seasons, and players can only access some areas during a specific season.</desc>

		<name>Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs</name>
		<desc>In the region of Oblivia, a gang of thieves known as the "Pokémon Pinchers" are stealing wild Pokémon and planning to use them for their own nefarious purposes.  Two Pokémon Rangers, Summer and Ben, are sent to investigate.  However, after an encounter with the Pinchers, one of them is kidnapped while the other is left stranded on an island.  There they meet a Pichu with a ukulele, who teams up with them to help rescue its Pichu friends who have also been captured by then Pinchers.  Can you rescue your partner, and save the Pokémon of the Oblivia region?

Pokémon Ranger: Guardian Signs is the third in the Pokémon Ranger series.  As with the previous games, you move your character around using a device known as the stylus, as well as battling with a device called the "capture styler" (represented by the stylus).  To battle, you encounter a Pokémon on the touch screen, and your aim is to repeatedly draw connecting loops around it until you deplete its health to zero, allowing it to join your team.  Pokémon can be used in the environment to clear obstacles and help you progress (such as such as cutting trees, extinguishing fires and so on), or by assisting you in battle and helping you weaken enemy Pokémon.  Near the start of the game, Ukulele Pichu becomes a part of your team and randomly appears during battles to assist.  If you tap it when it appears, it will jump into battle and play its ukulele, which scatters musical notes around the screen which weaken enemies.

A little bit further into the game, you also gain the help of the Legendary Pokémon dogs, Raikou, Entei and Suicune, first introduced in Pokémon Gold and Silver.  These Pokémon have special abilities that allow you to reach places that you normally couldn't (for example, Raikou can leap across large gaps).  To summon these Pokémon, you must draw a special sign with the stylus that represents them, but these can only be drawn outside where the sky can be seen.

After a key point in the game, you also unlock the ability to travel back in time with Celebi, which gives you access to wireless multiplayer Pokémon Ranger missions.  These missions can be played with up to four players, and Rangers can team up to help capture Pokémon more quickly.  This is a great help as each mission must be completed within a certain time for it to be a success.  Most wireless missions can also be played solo, but are more difficult this way.  You can also earn experience which can be used to increase your capture styler's power, health and speed.</desc>

		<name>Pony Friends</name>
		<desc>At the beginning of Pony Friends, the player has the choice to buy a pre-defined pony or create his one from scratch by choosing from a variety of different colors and patterns for each of the four parts (body, legs, face and hair).

Once a pony has been created and named, the player has to care for it by feeding or brushing it in order to keep it's values from decreasing. Depending on how good the values and how well the pony has been treated, it will react differently to the players hand (the stylus). A new pony for example will be afraid at first and will run away when the player makes sudden movements.

Besides caring for your pony, outfitting it with accessories or giving it small treats like apples, you can also do racing events, trail riding or let it perform tricks. While the player can't control the horse itself in the racing events, he needs to cheer it on through the microphone to keep it going. But if the player shouts too loud or not loud enough, the pony will slow down.

During trail riding the player can instead pet the pony or order it to gallop through the forest to train it. While the pony rides on the trail, the player can look around and can each day fulfill a quest by photographing specific animals around the trail by touching them with the stylus. There are also hidden gates which open up additional trails if found and touched.

Tricks are performed by the pony if it's out on the field. Depending on it's condition and on how many awards the player has already earned with the pony, the trick will be more difficult.</desc>

It learns counter attacks that target your weaknesses and look to exploit any repetitive tactics players use. Defenders react better to danger, closing down the ball and charging at shots and the goalkeepers hold shots that are closer to them as well. Teammates make more intelligent runs into space and the close control has been sharpened to ensure quick and fluid passing and speedy attacks can be built. The next gen versions also feature extensive edit modes so players can completely customise their PES 2008 experience.</desc>

		<name>Professor Heinz Wolff's Gravity</name>
		<desc>Professor Heinz Wolff's Gravity is a puzzle game similar to the Incredible Machine series. During the 100 levels the goal is always to press a button. To achieve this goal the player has a selection of items to his disposal - nothing fancier than boards or balls - to build a construction of chain reactions. When he starts the experiment, a ball (in seldom cases a vehicle) gets released to set the thing in motion. An innovation compared to similar games is that the physics simulation doesn't get disabled during the building phase. This means the player can destroy his constructions when being careless during placing another item. There is also a help functions which gives hints to the correct solution.

By beating levels the player unlocks so-called sandbox levels where he can freely experiment with the physics engine. Mini games, e.g. building a tower which has to withstand an earthquake, can be played against other players. There are a small differences between the versions: the PC version offers an editor to build own experiments and the DS version offers fewer sandbox levels and mini games.</desc>

		<desc>After hearing about a strange inheritance dispute in the town of St. Mystere, Professor Layton and his young apprentice, Luke, travel there on behalf of Lady Dahlia, who has requested their presence to resolve the issue.  However, it quickly becomes apparent that St. Mystere is quite strange... all the townsfolk seem to be obsessed with puzzles, and Baron Reinhold's fortune isn't the only secret that the town has hidden...

Professor Layton and the Curious Village is a puzzle game which uses the works of Akira Tago, author of the Japanese series of Head Gymnastics books as its basis.  As both Layton and Luke, players explore the town of St. Mystere screen by screen.  Each screen contains puzzles, either hidden in the scenery or by talking to characters.  Upon finding a puzzle, the screen changes and the player is presented with the puzzle itself: the description of the puzzle on the top screen, and the puzzle (as well as the place to input the answer) on the bottom screen.  Some puzzles require simple calculation, some have a trick answer, while others are riddles.  The selection of puzzles is quite varied.  If the player gets stuck, they can purchase a hint with 'Hint Coins'.  However, these are limited - more can be found hidden in the game world, but there a set number of coins in the entire game.

Professor Layton has a visual style similar to that of a watercolor painting.  While most of the game does not have much animation, key story sequences are told in fully animated and voice acted scenes.  The game also used Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to connect to the Internet and download additional puzzles for players to solve.</desc>

The only clue is a ticket for the luxurious Molentary Express, found in the apartment.  Will Layton and Luke be able to solve this latest mystery? 
 
Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box is the sequel to Professor Layton and the Curious Village, taking place directly after the events of the first game.  Players take the role of the titular professor and his assistant Luke as they explore the Molentary Express for clues to the mystery of the Elysian Box.  By talking to people and examining the environment, players discover puzzles, which when solved progress the story further. 
 
As with the first game, puzzle can range from logic problems, to riddles, to simple calculation.  If stuck, players can spend 'Hint Coins' that they can find throughout the game - but there are a finite amount available, so they should only be used when needed.</desc>

		<name>Professor Layton and the Last Specter</name>
		<desc>Three years before the events in the first game, Professor Layton receives a letter from his old schoolmate Clark Triton. It states that ?a mysterious giant shrouded in fog has been laying waste to our houses.? The professor heads to the town of Misthallery to investigate, and is joined by Emmy, his new assistant. What is the meaning of all the destruction, and is it related to the village?s folklore legend of a ?specter?? The unfolding story details how Professor Layton and his apprentice, Luke, met. 
 
Professor Layton and the Last Specter follows the structure that has become a staple for the series, in which the player is presented with a succession of puzzles scattered throughout the game world to solve with logic using the touchscreen, with bonus puzzles made available to download on a weekly basis. 
 
In the Japanese and North American releases, the game also includes Professor Layton's London Life, a bonus role-playing game wherein the player?s character lives in Little London with Professor Layton and a number of characters from the series. Players can customize their character with special clothing and collect items and furniture. Some of these help the player?s character to enter certain areas of the city or perform tasks that help out the townspeople.</desc>

		<desc>Accord, teacher of the local magic school, has lost her magic flying cane. There is word of an award so the students are busy searching high and low for it. Naturally our heros, Amitie and her school nemesis Raffine, make their way toward the distant dark castle. Challenging, and being challenged by, everyone you come across in a game of, Puyo Pop!  

A puzzle game of the falling-block variety the goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by is the combining four or more of the same color which will vanish. This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto you opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.

When an opponent send Nuisance Puyos to you screen you can try to "offset" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to you opponent. When any players field becomes so full they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.

Puyo Pop Fever features a Two Player Mode. Some versions allow for more people such as the DS version which allows up to eight players to compete in free-for-all or team modes.</desc>

		<path>./Puzzle City (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Puzzle City</name>
		<desc>Puzzle City contains elements of SimCity and Tetris. As the new Constructor Manager at Puzzle City, Inc., the player has to build cities by placing colored blocks (in shapes resembling those of Tetris), which arrive on a conveyor belt. Each color represents a kind of building (green for residential, yellow for industrial, blue for commercial, and so on), with different kinds of shapes. The player has to clear the tray, placing the blocks in the available locations on the city's map, or else it will become full and breaks. The blocks can be rotated (using the right mouse button) to better fit the map.

Each level has a collection of goals, usually filling a certain portion of the map (20% in the game's start) and constructing certain kinds of structures (like 2x2 residential blocks). Some maps have highlighted areas with specific colors to build on, and those must also be filled.

When 2x2 blocks of the same kind are built, the player earn power-ups. The main ones are the recycler, which changes the shape of a given set of blocks; the trash can, where the player can put unwanted pieces; and the bulldozer, which allows the player to destroy blocks already built. Those three, when earned, are added to specific counter. Other kinds of power-ups are accumulated below the conveyor belt, such as: the hammer, which breaks every set in the conveyor to one block sets; the spray can, which randomly recolors all sets in the conveyor belt; the dynamite, which makes all sets in the conveyor explode; the clock, which stops time for 3 seconds; the snail, which slows down the conveyor belt for a while, etc.

There are two play modes, Story and Untimed, and a total of 48 cityscapes.</desc>

		<path>./Puzzle Kingdoms (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).zip</path>
		<name>Puzzle Kingdoms</name>
		<desc>Puzzle Kingdoms is a RPG game using tile matching mini-games as the combat system of the battles, in a similar fashion to Puzzle Quest, another puzzle-based RPG with fantasy themes released in 2007 by the same developers. Instead of swapping adjacent tiles to create groups of three or more like in the earlier title, the main gameplay mechanic this time is to move columns and rows to match tiles.

The player controls a hero character, moving between waypoints in an isometric map similar to the ones found on the Heroes of Might and Magic series. The game is divided in campaigns, where the objective is to invade and defeat all the main cities from a kingdom to conquer it. The hero character levels up automatically after winning a number of battles, adding new abilities and fresh spells to the available arsenal.

The battle screen has a grid of tiles occupying most of the central space, with the troops of the two fighting armies lined up at the sides. Each row and column has buttons to move them, and the  combatants take turns trying to make matches of three or more of the same type to charge their troops and increase the damage against the enemy when attacking. When one of the troops is fully charged, an attack button lights up at the top of the screen to unleash an assault against the opposite forces. Attack tiles have a similar effect, starting the maneuver when three or more of them are lined up on the grid.

The troopers have attack and defense statistics that determine the outcome of the attacks, with the alignment with the board colors and terrain effects increasing or decreasing their points. The player can retreat, a useful strategy when the battle is practically lost, allowing the remaining troops to be saved. There are four slots below the troop lines for spells, that can be used to change the number of specific tiles on the grid, alter statistics and help in other ways. They are charged by making matches with tiles of their colors.

New troops can be recruited on the outposts, with money received after winning the battles. Shrines, taverns, dungeons and other special buildings have mini-games, with multiple goals like clearing the grid on a set number of turns, making a series of matches within a time limit and other similar challenges. Completing these bonus stages gives new items and upgrades.</desc>

		<desc>Puzzler Collection is a collection of thousands of puzzles in four categories: Fitword, Crossword, Sudoku and Wordsearch. In Fitword, the words shown must be placed in a grid. In Crossword, clues are given and the player must input the word that matches the description. In Sudoku, numbers are placed in a grid in such a way that no duplicates occur horizontally and vertically. In Wordsearch, the words shown have to be crossed out in a grid of letters. 

There are several game modes and difficulty levels to choose from. The Nintendo DS is held like a book during gameplay, and the player can either play lefthanded or righthanded (which determines on which side the player holds the Touch Screen).

The game has five game modes which include:

1.  Simply Puzzle, this lets the player pick any type of puzzle for a quick challenge without keeping score.
2.  Quick Blast, which offers a number of puzzles based on the amount of time the player has. This can be set to show up daily, for instance for a daily bus trip.
3.  Fast &amp; Fun, which adds a timer to increase pressure on the player.
4.  Head to Head, a two-player challenge.
5.  Tournament, in which the player solves a series of puzzles increasing in difficulty from Easy to Pro.

In the European version, all puzzles are localized.</desc>

		<name>Ragnarok DS</name>
		<desc>Throughout the world, the people of the major powers throughout the land live in peace and prosperity, unaware that a great evil lurks on the horizon. There is a clandestine group, under the guise of scholarly research, plotting to resurrect a goddess whose time has long since passed. To achieve this goal, they need two things; a vessel of flesh and blood to house the spirit of the goddess, and the lives of every living being offered up as a sacrifice. It is against the backdrop of this coming chaos that Ares, an orphan from a small, forgotten village, sets out to seek his fortune as an adventurer. At the start of his journey, he encounters a beautiful young girl with mysterious powers named Shiera, who has not only lost her memories about herself, but also of the world around her. Together, they embark on an adventure that will ultimately decide the fate of the entire world. Ragnarok Online, the international massively multiplayer online (MMO) phenomenon, now comes to the Nintendo DS. With over three million registered users in North America, Ragnarok DS brings the same addictive game play of exploration and customization to a handheld platform, giving the huge number of online PC players the next best thing when they are unable to log into their regular Ragnarok Online account from a computer.</desc>

		<name>Rainbow Islands Revolution</name>
		<desc>Bubby and Bobby return in this Nintendo DS update to the popular arcade game, Rainbow Islands.  The game takes place several years after Bubble Bobble, and the brothers now have the ability to create rainbows to destroy their enemies.  However, they'll need this ability, as the residents of the seven Rainbow Islands have been imprisoned, and need to be rescued!

The DS version of Rainbow Islands functions differently from the original.  Your character is now floating inside a bubble on the touch screen, and the levels can be seen both on the top and touch screens.  You can drag your character around the screen by touching them with the stylus, or you can drag the stylus elsewhere on-screen to create a rainbow.  If you tap a drawn rainbow, it will fall down vertically, killing any enemies underneath.

Finally, there are two special rainbows that can be drawn if you hold the L or R buttons, each with their own special function.  Drawing a circle will create a large bubble which you can drag around the screen and hit other enemies with; while drawing a triangle will create a kind of black hole that will suck in enemies, allowing you to take them out in one go.  Lastly, there is a special rainbow that can only be drawn when your 'Star Gauge' is full: when it is, this gauge can be tapped, and the player is given a short time to draw a five-pointed star (similar to the 'Healing Touch' in Trauma Center).  If successful, all enemies on both screens will be destroyed.

In addition to this new style of play, there is also a 'Score Mode'.  In this mode, you only have one life, and must earn as many points as possible as a barrage of enemies continues to attack you.  The game also has two secret characters to unlock, as well as a Versus Mode where players compete to reach the top of the level first.  The special rainbows are not available in either of these modes.</desc>

		<path>./Reader Rabbit - Kindergarten (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Reader Rabbit - Kindergarten</name>
		<desc>Reader Rabbit Kindergarten is an educational adventure game based on the characters from the popular and long-running series of learning games for young children, Reader Rabbit. Intended for children ages 3-6, the game is designed to teach basic skills to prepare kids for success in kindergarten and provide a foundation for further learning. The game's main character, Reader Rabbit, and his sidekick, Sam the Lion, are flying their airship over a new island when they are mysteriously captured by a giant bubble wrap. They then come to realize they have landed in Balloon Town, an island made of balloons where all sharp objects including their airship are locked away in a palace. In order to free their airship and continue on their journey, they must first gain access to the palace by helping the band wake-up the sleeping bull in front of the palace. To do this they must gather the 5 different instruments for the band that have been scattered around Balloon Town. In order to receive an instrument, players must help Reader Rabbit and Sam in a series of educational mini-games designed to teach kids basic skills such as memory, recognizing patters, simple math, phonics, rhyming, following directions and placing items in order. All mini-games have simplistic point-and-click controls using the Nintendo DS touch screen interface. Once players have retrieved all of the instruments and gained access to the palace, they must complete two more mini-games (a listening comprehension/sequencing game and a reading skills game) before gaining access to their airship so they can continue on to a new adventure. The game is presented in a colorful cartoon style with short videos, full voice acting, and sing-along songs designed to engage young children while still teaching basic skills. Players will be able to adjust the difficulty level of all mini-games independently which can add hours of replay value.</desc>

		<name>Rhythm Heaven</name>
		<desc>Get ready to feel the rhythm!  Rhythm Heaven is a game based entirely around musical rhythm and timing.  The game is a collection of games based around a song, where the player must perform actions in time to the music to successfully complete the game.  All games are based around the simple motions of tapping, sliding and flicking the stylus.

As each game varies from each other, at the start of each game, you're given a brief tutorial to get the hang of how the game you'll be playing works.  Tasks for games include (but are not limited to) flicking to construct machinery, releasing the stylus at the right time to belt out a loud note, sliding to rub a lizard's tail in time to a mating dance beat, tapping to gulp down dumplings, tapping and flicking to harvest vegetables and get rid of moles, and more.  After every four games, a special "remix" game appears, which combines the previous games into a hectic mix, where you never know what will be up next.</desc>

		<name>Ridge Racer Ds</name>
		<desc>Ridge Racer DS is a remake of Ridge Racer 64 with some changes and additions.  All the same levels are there, but there are plenty of new cars, including Namco- and Nintendo-themed vehicles.  There is also some new music that was not in the N64 version.

The Touch Screen on the Nintendo DS is put to use all throughout the game, including navigation through every menu and even a revolutionary new control where the player steers the steering wheel with the stylus or thumb ring.

Another addition to the game is the use of the Nintendo DS's Wi-Fi capabilities.  Using wireless communication, up to 6 players can race against each other.  In fact, up to 6 players can play with a Game Card in only one of the systems.  The other 5 players don't even need the game.  There will be more items, such as cars, available to play with if all of the systems have a Ridge Racer DS Game Card in though.  So there is an advantage to having multiple Game Cards.</desc>

The battles in Rondo of Swords use the unusual Route Maneuver System. Instead of walking up to an enemy and attacking, instead you will run through enemies to attack. This adds tactical considerations; you can easily attack multiple enemies in a turn, you can run through allies to get bonuses to your attack, and you can attack from the sides or behind to get an advantage.</desc>

		<name>The Settlers</name>
		<desc>The Settlers is a remake of The Settlers II: Veni, Vidi, Vici for the Nintendo DS.

The premise of the game is set to ancient Rome, with you taking control of the Romans in the main campaign, or additionally the Vikings, Nubian and Asian empires in Free Play mode.

The game works very differently from most general strategy games. Your goal is to reach the gateway at the end of each map, usually hidden amidst the enemy lines. You must build military buildings to expand your borders that you can reach the resources that are initially out of your reach. Eventually reaching the gateway to proceed onto the next level. Your city needs roads to optimize the trade routes and allow different buildings to get the resources they need for production.

The game is highly based on gathering resources and optimizing the roads to provide maximal resource gathering. In example, you need a woodcutter to provide a sawmill with logs in order for the builders to build new structures and harbors to build ships for your expeditions.

The game is almost a 1:1 recreation of the original Settlers II game, but it adds few new things to the game such as new music and new GUI to support the stylus.</desc>

		<path>./Showtime Championship Boxing (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Showtime Championship Boxing</name>
		<desc>Named after the television boxing program airing on the US Showtime cable network, this game offers a mix of fourteen heavyweights and welterweights and four arenas to fight in (New York, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Chicago). Basic moves include upper block, body block, dodging left and right, short punches and powered punches (hook, jab, uppercut, bodyshot). While playing, there are a few parameters to take into account. First there is a health meter that recharges when the boxer dodges hits for some time. Punches need to be thrown strategically, as an energy bar determines the effectiveness. Too many punches deplete the bar and the amount also determines if a boxer will be able to get up when knocked down. A round timer and knockdown lights are also shown. At certain times, a power-up indicator will become available. This allows a boxer to charge a heavy punch, but the opponent will have time to react. When the charging takes too long, the punch is lost.

The different game modes (different for heavyweight and welterweight) include:

1. Single Fights (Quick): fight for only one round until one of the boxers is knocked out.

2. Single Fights (Regular): play for 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12 rounds and choose to decide it by a KO, TKO or by points.

3. Points System: after each round each boxer is awarded points based on performance. At the end of a fight, or after a KO or TKO, the player with the most points wins.

4. Belts: series of three (Amateur), four (Contender) or six (Showtime) fights. Each fight lasts four rounds or three minutes and the aim is to win one of the belts.

5. King of the Ring: one boxer takes on all other boxers in his weight division in one long round.

Additional fighters are unlocked by winning competitions. Most of the modes can also be played with two players through a wireless connection (DS).</desc>

		<name>SimCity DS - The Ultimate City Simulator</name>
		<desc>SimCity DS brings the classic series to the handheld consoles.

As the Mayor placed in charge of running their own city, players use the touchscreen to build up and run their town, providing commercial, residential and industrial zones, protection against crime and fire, entertainment areas and even airports, highways and railways for the SimCitizens to travel.

Players also have to contend with natural (and unnatural) disasters, the pressures of an ever-expanding city, and of course, public opinion, which can make a job very difficult if things get out of control.

New to this version is the inclusion of wireless communication with other Mayors via a Post Office.  Players can send letters to each other, giving a short summary of the state of their city. When players send letters to each other, they earn special monuments for their cities.  Additionally, when disaster strikes, the Mayor can take a more hands-on approach in directly rescuing their SimCitizens.</desc>

		<path>./Slingo Quest (USA) [b].zip</path>
		<name>Slingo Quest</name>
		<desc>Slingo Quest is a progression of Slingo games; Slingo is a combination of slot machines and Bingo. The player is presented with a Bingo-style card (usually 5x5 squares) and is given a certain number of spins. Each spin triggers 5 wheels to spin, one corresponding to each column. The player then marks off squares on the card if they contain numbers from the spin. Jokers can also show up during spins which allow the player to mark off any square from the column.

Players can get extra points for various feats, such as clearing the entire card. Different cards have different Slingo patterns highlighted in red that are worth extra points if the player marks every square. Sometimes, slots can produce devils that take a percentage of the player's accumulated treasure (though the treasure might be safe if the player has demon protection). 

Further, there are bonus rounds to be played against a pirate where a lot of treasure is at stake. The player and the pirate take turns spinning on the same board. Occasionally, a treasure chest pops up which may contain treasure or it may confiscate treasure. The player that discovers the chest has right of first refusal-- they can choose to open it or make the other player open it.

Other rounds present the player with a 7x7 game board, instead of a 5x5 board. Some rounds have 2, 3, or 4 5x5 boards that are played concurrently.</desc>

		<desc>Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood is a Nintendo DS console role-playing game based on the Sonic the Hedgehog series. It focuses on the events surrounding the kidnapping of Knuckles the Echidna and the disappearance of the Chaos Emeralds, which leads into a much larger story. This game is notable for being the first (and so far only) RPG in the Sonic series.

The story of Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood is split into ten chapters. The first six take place in Sonic's world, with the team attempting to find Knuckles, and trying to stop the Master Emerald from being taken by the Marauders. The final four sees Sonic and the team traveling to another dimension, called the Twilight Cage, in order to stop a new threat to their own world and confront the alien species that reside there.</desc>

		<name>Sonic Rush Adventure</name>
		<desc>While flying in their plane across the ocean, looking for a strange energy source, Sonic and Tails' plane is struck by lightning!  They plunge into the murky depths of the ocean...and awaken on a small island.  A local, a raccoon named Marine, informs them that they are on Southern Island.  With Marine and Tails' help, Sonic sets about to explore the nearby islands.

Sonic Rush Adventure is a side-scrolling adventure game, and the sequel to Sonic Rush.  Sonic's goal through these platform levels is to zip through as quickly as possible.  By pressing the B Button while in the air, Sonic can increase his Tension Gauge by performing aerial tricks. Pressing Y uses a Super Boost, which will allow him to plow through anything in his path at amazing speed, but drains the Tension Gauge.

When Sonic reaches the treasure chest at the end of each level, he will be given a material that can be used for construction of ships and other devices.  At first, Sonic is stranded on Southern Island, but after the construction of the waterbike, he can travel to other islands and explore them.  Similar to The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, the player must plot a path to the next island using the stylus, and then provide limited control over the ship as it travels.  However, Sonic has different ships, each of which are notably different from Link's steamboat.

Sonic Rush Adventure also features a Battle Mode, where players can either play locally with a friend, or across the world through Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.  Players can take each other on in a one-on-one race through various levels as each player aims to get to the end first.</desc>

		<path>./Soul Bubbles (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).zip</path>
		<name>Soul Bubbles</name>
		<desc>Soul Bubbles is very similar to Bubble Ghost and requires the player to save lost Spirits by transporting them in bubbles to the exit of each level.

The player takes over the role of a Spirit Herder who is tasked with ferrying souls to the underworld. To move the Spirits and keep them relatively save, they need to be be enclosed in soup bubbles. The Spirit Herder then can blow those bubbles through the level, deflate them if they are too big and even cut them into two bubbles and rejoin them later when required. If a bubble bursts, the Spirit will slowly suffocate and eventually die if the player can't draw a new bubble around it fast enough.

But the way to the Gateway Cube isn't an easy one and it's not just as simple as blowing the bubbles from start to finish in the 40 levels. Besides the natural dangers in form of rocks, plants or hungry critters that all destroy the bubble, there are also environment puzzles waiting to be solved like activating a switch which requires a big bubble. There is also Star Dust and so-called Calabash waiting to be collected. While the Star Dust will increase the light emitted by the Spirits and can be collected by simply drawing a new bubble around it, the Calabashs are well hidden but once the player found them all, he will unlock the eighth World called Agartha, the Land of the Dead.

To help with the search, the Spirits will change their shape to heart if a Calabash is near or turn into yellow triangles if there is imminent danger.</desc>

		<name>Space Invaders Extreme</name>
		<desc>The pixelated aliens are back to celebrate their 30th anniversary!

Taking a cue from other recent arcade classic updates, Space Invaders Extreme takes the gameplay of the 1978 classic, and reinvents it, giving power-up blasters, boss aliens, and an electronic soundtrack that plays in sync with the onscreen action.

Basic gameplay remains the same: Players guide a ground based cannon either left or right, blasting an oncoming fleet of invaders before they reach the ground.  The main objective is to get as many points as possible before running out of lives.

Space Invaders Extreme introduces new elements, such as invader fleets that break pattern from their left to right descent, boss aliens that require several hits to destroy, power-ups that enhance the cannon, allowing the player to wipe out multiple invaders at once, while racking up combos.

Wi-Fi play is also possible, allowing player to team up cooperatively, or compete against the other.  The Nintendo DS version also has a feature for online ranking.</desc>

		<name>Spanish For Everyone!</name>
		<desc>Spanish for Everyone is a Nintendo DS video game published by Activision. It was created and developed by an independent company, Humagade. It gained notoriety when the cut scenes were released on to YouTube. One of the developing staff has commented on OverClocked ReMix in regards to the storyline and gameplay. The cut scenes contained subliminal stereotypical messages. The game also was mocked for its absurd storyline.</desc>

		<name>Spectrobes</name>
		<desc>Junior Nanairo Interplanetary Patrol officers Rallen and Jeena are on a routine mission when they hear a strange distress call. They find the wreckage of an ancient escape pod. Its inhabitant is in cryogenic sleep and when revived tells them about a terrible new threat: the Krawl. The Krawl are an alien lifeform who consume whole planets, and they have already been spotted in this part of the galaxy. 

Fortunately, there is a way to defeat them. This requires the help of an extinct lifeform called Spectrobes. Rallen and Jeena must visit planets to find fossils of these Spectrobes, excavate, awaken and train them. There are almost 500 different ones for the player to collect and trade. To excavate a Spectrobe, the player must first locate it using another Spectrobe. Using the stylus on the touch-screen, one can carefully remove layers of rock and soil to dig up the fossil, without damaging it. 

The fossil must then be taken back to the space ship, put in a machine and awakened by using your voice or blowing in the microphone. The soil also contains various crystals and minerals, which can be used to feed and train the Spectrobes. They will evolve to stronger and more effective stages. 

The Krawl are on the planets in the form of vortexes. Walking too close to them triggers a battle, in which two Spectrobes join Rallen against the enemy. With a combination of buttons and shoulderbuttons the Spectrobes can unleash special attack powers or combine their respective attacks in real time action.

Via WiFi and on a dedicated website players can battle against each other or exchange Spectrobes and items. Special collectibles can be downloaded. Items and Spectrobes can also be added to the game using game cards with holes through which the touch-screen must be touched in a specific order.</desc>

		<name>Super Collapse! 3</name>
		<desc>The third game in the Collapse! series has the same core gameplay as previous games but features several new modes including for the first time a quest mode. The following eight game modes are available: 

1.  Classic

  Quest

  Relapse

  Strategy

  Puzzle

  Slider

  Continuous

  Countdown

Initially, only classic and quest modes are available. The rest can be unlocked by playing the quest mode. The classic mode works in the same way as in previous games. The player is presented with a grid that is partially filled with coloured blocks. More blocks are added to grid, one row at a time, from the bottom of the grid. The aim of the game is to remove these blocks before they reach the top of the screen. To remove blocks the player simply clicks a group of three or more like coloured blocks. Some special pieces exists such as bombs that blows up surrounding blocks.

In the quest mode the player enters a strange world where he progresses from level to level. For each level that is completed a new is made available. The quest mode features a store where the player can purchase different things for the money he earns for completing each level. For more money it's also play different casino mini games such as slot machines. All of the game modes are available in the quest mode and after a number of them have been completed they become unlocked for the player to play at any time. 

The relapse mode works like classic but new blocks come in from both top and bottom. In the strategy mode new block will only come in when the player clicks. In the puzzle mode the player has to clear all blocks from the screen and no new appear. In the slider mode the rows of blocks will slide left and right so that the groups changes. The continuous mode is an endless variant of the classic mode and the player has to last as long as possible. In the countdown mode the player has to score as many points as possible in two minutes.</desc>

		<name>Superman Returns</name>
		<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, Superman Returns puts you behind the cape of the man of steel as he returns to the earth after his exile in outer space.

Your main objective is to protect Metropolis from the attacks of several enemies ripped right from Superman's comics.
The main campaign gives you a hexagonal map of Metropolis which pinpoints your location as well as your current enemy's location and any disaster areas he may have caused. Since Superman himself is invulnerable, Metropolis itself has a health bar that keeps track of just how much damage the city is enduring, and which measures your level of success/failure.Your objective thus is to move around the map each turn to try and take control of each disaster area which triggers a timed 3rd person perspective sequence in which you control Superman as he flies through the city and uses his powers to solve whatever task is at hand (blowing out fires with his super-breath, destroying mind-control beacons with his heat vision, saving people, etc. etc.) catching up with your enemies triggers a fight sequence in which you must input the correct button-presses on cue to defeat your opponents. In between these rounds story segments that follow the movie's plot play out, which involve a unique 3D action sequence that mimics the movie's counterpart.

Features a single-player campaign as well as two wireless multiplayer modes in which you can face-off against four other Supermen in unique disaster areas to see who gets to clear the objectives faster than the rest. Also includes a gallery of Superman comic covers that are unlocked by collecting Krypton crystals in the game.</desc>

		<desc>Surf's Up is based on the 2007 animated film of the same name, featuring surfing penguins and wacky hijinks.

Surf's up for DS and PSP is a racing game that brings the player through an interesting adventure featuring all the characters from the CGI movie.  

The player can choose from a bunch of the movie characters and compete in races against other movie characters.  Each character has their own specific skills and their own surf boards.  The different levels/races contain jumps/ramps which enables the player to perform tricks using either the stylus to draw objects (DS) or repeating a button sequence (PSP).  Performing tricks will give you a speed boost which might just help you finish the race first and move on to the next round.

The levels also contain shortcuts and the race track is populated with different objects that can be used to gain a speed boost, distract or hit opponents and ultimately will help you finish the race first.

The game also offers a multi-player mode which enables you to play with friends who have the game and even friends who don't have the game (but have a console).</desc>

		<desc>The gameplay consists of helping Rapunzel completing several tasks for many characters from the film, primarily by using the Nintendo DS stylus to collect certain objects as well as tapping these characters to talk with them. Unlike the home console versions, a book found on Rapunzel's bed allows players to replay any chapter they want rather than a world map. Players also need to utilize the stylus to collect sun drops (in which collecting a certain number of them may come in handy if the player is stuck).

The DS microphone is also utilized to clear several objects out of the way (sensitivity can be adjusted any time in the Options menu).

Several minigames include coloring in pictures, petting several animal friends and even memory challenges.</desc>

		<name>Tiger Woods Pga Tour 08</name>
		<desc>Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08 is the second game in the series to appear on the Nintendo DS. The game features touch swing controls where the player drags the stylus downwards to backswing and then back upwards again to shoot. A smooth motion leads to a more accurate shot, while the power of the shot is determined by  how long the backswing is and the speed of the motion. At the same time the accuracy of the shot is determined by the angle of the swing. By sliding the stylus right or left, the ball may draw or fade although too much will lead to a hook or a slice. Once the ball is in the air, a close-up image of it appears on the bottom screen. By sliding the stylus repeatedly across the ball, the player is able to make it rotate. 

A more traditional tap control is also available. With it the player swings by pressing a button to begin a backswing. The swing meter bar will then increase until the player presses the button again to decide the power of the shot. After that the player has to press the button a third time to decide the alignment of the shot. 

The game feature a number of game modes. The play now mode allows the player to play a quick match. The player can customize the game by choosing rules (for example stroke play, match play or skins), course and number of holes. The courses are eight in total and include for instance Pebble Beach and St. Andrews. Up to four players can compete in the play now mode and team play is also an option.

The practice mode allows the player to try out the game in his own pace without any opponents or other distractions. In the Tiger Challenge mode the player gets to compete against the best player in the world for a chance to take on Tiger Woods himself. By winning challenges, more are unlocked as progress is made through the game. The player earns money by winning matches and these can be used to upgrade skills. Last, there is the PGA Tour mode where the player goes through a full season of golf with the goal of reaching number one on the ranking.

Multiplayer exist too for up to four players, both locally on one DS, through single or multi card wireless play or online through wi-fi connection.</desc>

		<name>Time Hollow</name>
		<desc>Time Hollow is an interactive novel in the vein of games like Phoenix Wright where the player talks to characters and examine areas to find clues and items to help them in their quest.

The story takes place with the player taking control of a young man by the name of Ethan Kairos, who discovers that his family has mysteriously disappeared and sets off to find them.  He then comes across a strange looking hollow pen and acquires it where he learns its unique and magical property: the ability to open portals to the past.  Using this pen, the player will take Ethan to the past in search of clues for his family and hopefully prevent the awful tragedy.

The gameplay mostly consists of exploring areas, searching for clues and items and encountering a plethora of different characters that can be talked to.  Using these items and conversations with the various characters, the player must solve puzzles throughout the stages while using the stylus pen to draw portals to link the past and present and travel between the time rift.

Junko Kawano (most notably responsible for the script of some of the Suikoden games, lends his talents for the character scripts for the game.</desc>

		<desc>Touch Darts is a straight forward simulation of various styles of darts games played by stroking the DS touch screen to "throw" the darts.

Tournament mode builds the players skill by presenting increasingly skilled opponents, while the challenge mode has several challenge games with various rules. These include Pairs, Round the clock and Card 21, where the player has to turn over playing cards by hitting them with the darts. The winner is the closest to 21 with two cards turned.</desc>

		<name>Touch Detective</name>
		<desc>After young Mackenzie's father died suddenly, she inherited the family detective agency.  Now, with the aid of her robotic butler Cromwell and her short but helpful assistant Funghi, she sets out to earn her reputation as the Touch Detective.  She'll chase down a stolen dream, search for a missing person, and more, as she attempts to become well known for her detecting skills.

Touch Detective is an adventure game in the style of later Sierra adventure games such as Space Quest 6.  Players navigate Mackenzie through various screens by touching the area where they want her to move.  Mackenzie can interact with certain on-screen objects with another tap of the stylus - depending on the object, she may look at it, pick it up, talk to it (if it can strike up a conversation), or even touch it to see what it feels like.  Mackenzie likes to feel objects to understand them, which is why she's the 'Touch' Detective.  Mackenzie can also check and combine objects in her inventory.

The top screen of the DS always has a close-up of Mackenzie herself.  As she talks to other characters, observes objects and so forth, the top screen will display Mackenzie's thoughts - so while she may say one thing to a person ("Sure, I get it..."), she'll be thinking another ("What was that?  I wasn't listening!").  It can be interesting (and sometimes insightful) to see the contrast between what Mackenzie says and what she thinks.

Touch Detective features four different 'cases' for Mackenzie to tackle.  After the first case is completed, players can also choose to take on the Bonus Case.  In this case, there is no main story, but Mackenzie can choose to take on small requests from characters, as well as increase her Touch List, which records the feeling of particular objects in the game world.</desc>

Although she is now a fully-accredited detective in the Great Detective Society, people still don't take her seriously. A string of thefts will pull her into a puzzling plot in which she'll have to use all her skills to unravel the mystery. 
 
Players control Mackenzie in this traditional point-and-click adventure. New to this title is an overarching story linking the five main cases, with an extra bonus case containing 30 side quests, making it a much longer game than the original.</desc>

		<desc>Touch the Dead is a rail-shooter that uses the Nintendo DS touchscreen and stylus in substitution for a light gun.  The player takes on the role of Rob Steiner, a prisoner in the Ashdown Hole State Penitentiary, who wakes one night to find his cell open and a pistol conveniently nearby.  He shortly discovers that the prison is now overrun with zombies and his only way out is to shoot his way out.

To shoot an enemy, the player taps the stylus on the screen and it is possible to target different body parts. Reloading is done through a clip in the bottom right hand corner, and the D-pad and face buttons are used to switch weapons. Ammo and health is gathered by shooting crates and the levels feature certain forks with different level paths. The available weapons are a handgun, shotgun, submachine gun and crowbar.</desc>

Raised by her aunt Jessica, Ashley believed both of her parents were dead; on the eve of her 14th birthday, she receives a strange letter and a device called a DTS from her father. She and her aunt are summoned to Blood Edward Island, which is where the game begins.

Near the beginning of the game, you meet the ghost of a boy who can't remember his past. Over the course of the game, you will uncover the truth of both your own past and this mysterious boy's.

Much use is made of the unique features of the DS. You will use the stylus, the microphone, and even the "sleep" feature in addition to more traditional puzzle solutions. Your character cannot die; there are no action or arcade sequences.</desc>

The game start outs in the big city where the players learns how to control the custom Transformer. Tapping the touchscreen has the transformer change from a quick-moving vehicle into a huge robot. The robot form can climb buildings, smash cars or other world objects, fight Autobots, and learn the basics of the mission on earth.  
 
From there the player completes missions in the city and travels to other locations. By scanning the large number of vehicles in the environment it becomes possible to transform into them. Some are just for fun, like the ice cream truck, but there are also helicopters and planes. 
 
Players can compete against your friends, including those who bought Autobots, in several game modes in local 4-player multiplayer. Through Nintendo Wi-Fi players complete daily missions to earn points for the Decepticons side in the battle for the Allspark. Player profiles can be uploaded and looked up on the game's official website where other profiles or scores can be checked out or compared. 
 
Aside from the gameplay mechanics and visual style, the Decepticons version is quite different from the Autobots version, with its own characters, missions, focus on situations in the movie and a different conclusion. Unlike the console versions the Transformers are initially restricted in their abilities and need to level up to a role-playing-like upgrade system. The game's focus is largely on attacking as there are little to no means of defence (including blocking), instead there are plenty of health icons.</desc>

		<name>Ultimate Band</name>
		<desc>You are a star, a big name on everyone's lips. People all over the country love you and now it's time to take the next step in stardom. To become an international superstar you have to travel to Rockopolis, the world capital of Rock'n'Roll and win the hearts of the fans across the city.

Ultimate Band is a game somewhat similar to music games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band. To win over the fans the player has to travel to several venues across Rockopolis and play gigs. At each venue the player can talk to the fans to see what their preference is, and then play songs accordingly. The main game mechanic is divided into four different instruments, all with their own style of play; Lead Guitar, Rhythm Guitar, Bass and Drums. Notes fall down from the top screen towards the bottom screen, much like in any other music game. If the instrument is a guitar or bass, the player has to pick the right chords with either the D-pad or the face buttons (depending on lefty/righty settings) and then strum with the stylus when the notes hit the strum bar. If the instrument picked is the drum set, the player has to tap the right drum as the notes fall down the screen.

The more "buzz" the player earns with the fans, the more venues, songs, instruments and samples are unlocked.

There is also a recording studio where the player can record a song free-hand, and another recording studio for up to four players to simultaneously record a song together via Wi-Fi. The game can hold up to 12 saved custom songs and 12 jam sessions.

The songs featured in the game are all covers of more or less famous songs such as "Rock Lobster" by The B-52's, "Take Over, the Break is Over" by Fall Out Boy, "Whip It" by Devo and several others.</desc>

		<path>./Ultimate Spider-Man (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Ultimate Spider-Man</name>
		<desc>For Ultimate Spider-Man for the DS, developer Vicarious Visions takes the technology and gameplay style  of their earlier Spider-Man 2 to adapt the storyline of the console version for the handheld.

Based on the Ultimate Spider-Man comic series, the game follows up on the comic's storyline about Peter Parker's childhood friend Eddie Brock and the Venom suit. Three months after his apparent death, Venom roams the streets of New York again. Thus Spider-Man must not only deal with the usual assortment of criminals and supervillains but also his old friend, while both Trask Industries and S.H.I.E.L.D. have set their sights on Eddie, who struggles to take control of the Venom suit. The DS game follows a cut-down version of the console version's storyline, but differs a lot in the details. The story is told in comic-style cutscenes that emulate the drawings of series artist Mark Bagley and also feature voice acting.

The game is a 2D side-scroller with real 3D graphics, with the camera moving and rotating to always keep the protagonist in view. Players will play as both Spider-Man and Venom, who have different abilities and are controlled in fundamentally different ways. Both must beat up various enemies and fight bosses, but other goals vary between the two.

Spider-Man is controlled via a standard button interface, allowing him to jump, swing along his web, punch, kick, shoot web balls and use his web to zip to walls and ceilings. When attack moves are stringed into combos, a power meter fills up that allows Spidey to unleash a special move that can be selected beforehand from the touch screen. His Spider-Sense also comes into play: when in immediate danger, an icon flashes. Pressing the left shoulder button within time allows Spider-Man to dodge the attack that follows.

A large part of Spider-Man's levels consists of rescuing innocents - freeing them from below heavy objects or carrying them away from danger. Lifting up the objects requires stroking upwards on the touch screen. The screen is also used for modifying electronics or disarming bombs. Lights flash up on a grid: green ones must be touched and red ones avoided.

In contrast, Venom is controlled almost exclusively through the touch screen. Alternate button-based controls are available but don't offer the full variety of moves. Venom can attack through either his claws or his tendrils by tapping either close or away from him. He can also use his tendrils to pick up objects and enemies and throw them around or smash them to the ground, all done through stylus movements. A further use of the tendrils is a targeted attack launched by stroking away from Venom in the wanted direction. 
Another gameplay element that only applies to Venom is feeding. The Venom suit drains Eddie's health constantly, so he must feed on humans to survive. This is done by simply tapping and holding the intended victim.

The game features branching paths: at some points, players can choose where to continue with the story (like Spider-Man choosing on whether to confront Shocker or the Rhino), leading to different sets of levels.

A multiplayer mode is also available: it features five different characters and eight arenas for one-on-one fights.</desc>

		<path>./Whac-A-Mole (USA).zip</path>
		<name>Whac-a-mole</name>
		<desc>This is an adaption of the arcade game Whac-A-Mole, for Nintendo's handheld devices. At the screen you have a 5x4 grid of holes (3x3 in the GBA version). As the game begins, moles will randomly pop up their heads in the holes. Now you have to hit them before they disappear again. DS users will use the stylus and tap the moles, while GBA users will have to use the directional pad to move a marker around the screen.

The game comes with three different game modes. The first is the arcade mode, were you for each level has to reach a certain amount of points before the time goes out. Different types of mole will show up. In addition to the standard mole, there's the golden mole which gives four times as much points as the standard one, and the plush one which gives minus points. Later in the game, you will also meet moles that attack your score, for example ninja and bazooka moles. Various power ups are also available. We have the multipliers, which  once active will give you double points for each mole, clocks that slows the time and bombs that do the opposite. Seven worlds are available, each with it's own graphical theme.

The second mode is the puzzle mode, which isn't the same on both platforms. In the DS version you have to recreate a shape that is shown on the upper screen. This is done by tapping moles of different colors. The GBA version has two puzzle games. One is a Tic Tac Toe where you have to hit three moles in a row before your opponent does so. The other is the Peg Puzzle where you have to empty the field from all moles. For each mole you remove, more moles will appear on the screen. The moles will have arrows around them, indicating where the new moles will pop up. However, there won't come any new moles if there already is a mole in that location.

The third mode is a simple quick play mode where you just specify how many levels you want to play and with what difficulty and then try to be successful. The DS version also supports a multiplayer mode.</desc>

		<name>Wiffle Ball</name>
		<desc>Wiffleball is a variation of baseball played in smaller or confined areas, generally played with a plastic ball and a plastic bat on a triangular field. In the game adaptation players can choose a character and locations such as a backyard, a school, a street or a sand lot. Next to single games, the game can also played in a season mode on all locations. Similar to baseball, the game consists of batters, pitchers and fielders. The pitcher's throw is based on speed and stamina meters, while batting is done through the stylus. The game also supports wireless multiplayer games.</desc>

		<name>Winter Sports 2 : The Next Challenge</name>
		<desc>Winter Sports 2009 is the follow-up to Winter Sport 2008. There are two new disciplines: snowboard half-pipe and biathlon. Others include curling, skeleton, bobsleigh, alpine skiing and more.

There is a local multiplayer mode featuring either hot-seat or split screen. Also the game features different weather conditions throughout the disciplines, and a physics engine that adds more realism and a more action-oriented approach compared to previous installments of the series.

The difference between the DS and the console versions is that on the DS, there are less disciplines (9 instead of 18). The DS version doesn't feature an online mode or a complex career mode like in the other versions of the game (where all disciplines can be played in a championship), but features a fast mode where players can go through the single disciplines and train their skills, as well as a campaign mode where players compete against the computer in different disciplines. The game is controlled with the stylus and the touchscreen of the DS.</desc>

		<name>The World Ends With You</name>
		<desc>The World Ends With You is an action-RPG that puts players in the role of Neku Sakuraba, a sullen, loner of a teenager who wakes up to find himself in modern day Shibuya, Japan, with no memory of how he got there and a ticking clock in his hand that tells him to complete the mission... or face erasure.

Neku and his partner Shiki Misaki find themselves as "Players" in a game that lasts seven days.  Each day, players are given various missions to perform by the "Reapers" within a certain time limit, or be erased from existence.

Players use collectible pins to amplify their combat powers against "The Noise", animal-like creatures which can corrupt the people and environment around them.  Each pin is activated in a different manner, from tapping the touchscreen, making sweeping motions with the stylus, or even blowing into the DS microphone.  Neku fights on the lower screen of the DS, while his partner fights on the upper screen.  Their combat styles are different, but can be combined to form more powerful attacks.  

Players can purchase clothing to increase the effectiveness of their attacks, and gain PP points to enhance their pin abilities.  PP is usally gained through combat, but can also be gained by coming into wi-fi contact with another person's DS.

There is also a wi-fi mini-game called "Ten Pin Slammer", where players can use one pin at a time to knock the other players' pins off the gameboard.</desc>

The player can either opt for the single-player mode, competing in custom matches or setting challenges against computer teams; or play against human opponents in hotswap or multiplayer modes.

But to reach the villains, first you'll need to battle your way through their henchmen, from robot cheerleaders and zombie construction workers to tigers and tuxedo-wearing gangsters.

Adding to the replayability, each of the four monks has his or her own unique moves and special elemental attacks, which you can unlock as you play through the game. You can also use the weird and wonderful powers of the Shen Gong Wu that you collect to aid you in your quest, including the Two Ton Tunic, the Third Arm Sash and the Star Hanabi.</desc>

		<name>Yoshi's Island DS</name>
		<desc>After failing to kidnap the Mario Bros. in the original Yoshi's Island, Kamek the Magikoopa has decided to set his sights higher.  Instead of just kidnapping the famous brothers, he's sent an army of his toadies out to kidnap children across the world!  Luckily, Mario avoids escape, and again lands in the hands of the Yoshis.  It's up to the Yoshis to carry Mario across Yoshi's Island and rescue Luigi and the other babies.

Yoshi's Island DS is a sequel to the SNES game, Yoshi's Island.  In it, players control Yoshi as he travels to Kamek's castle to rescue Luigi.  Yoshi can carry Baby Mario, Peach, DK, Wario or Bowser on his back - depending on the baby carried, Yoshi will gain a special ability; for example, Mario lets Yoshi dash, Peach allows Yoshi to float for a longer period of time, and Wario whips out a gigantic magnet to attract coins and other metallic objects.  If Yoshi is hit by an enemy, a counter appears, and begins to slowly count down to zero.  If it reaches zero, the baby is kidnapped, and Yoshi loses a life.  Yoshi can increase his counter by collecting stars that are rewards for some puzzles and defeating certain enemies.

Another feature of Yoshi's Island DS is the ability to hurl eggs to defeat foes.  Yoshi can eat nearly every enemy - if you press down on the control pad when Yoshi is holding an enemy in his mouth, he will turn it into an egg.  Yoshi can hurl his eggs at enemies and objects such as certain walls to destroy them.  You can even pick up coins and other collectibles by throwing an egg at them.  Finally, Yoshi can ricochet eggs off walls to hit things that he would otherwise be unable to reach.

While the object of each level is to simply reach the end, avid gamers will aim to get 100% for each level.  To do this, they must reach the end of each level with thirty stars, find the twenty red coins hidden amongst the regular ones, and collect the five flowers in each level.  One special  "Character Coin" is also hidden in each level - these have a picture of a particular baby on them, and can only be collected when Yoshi has that baby on his back.</desc>

		<path>./Zendoku (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).zip</path>
		<name>Zendoku</name>
		<desc>Zendoku takes the concept of the puzzle game Sudoku and adds role playing elements to it.

The game replaces the numbers 1 to 9 with nine Martial Arts symbols like a panda or a dragon but the original rules remain in place. This means the player still needs to complete a column, row or 3x3 box were every symbol is only used once. The player can test his skills either in Classic Sudoku or in Zen-Mode where he needs to solve Sudoku puzzles under the pressure of time, but the core of the game is the Quest-Mode. 

At the beginning of the quest the player chooses from eight available characters. Four fight with weapons, four freehand but each one has a different quest, uses different fighting styles and has a different lucky symbol. Kingkage is for example a typical ninja. He uses the Ninjutsu-style, wants to be a legendary fighter and has the panda as his lucky symbol. Once a decision has been made. the player follows the story line of the chosen character on a 2D world map and when a fight occurs, the opponents play a round of Sudoku.

Every time one of the fighters completes a column, row or 3x3 box an attack is launched and obstacles appear on the opponents board while an attack icon travels along a rail towards the attacked. If he now correctly places his lucky symbol on the board, the attack will be reversed back his opponent. Placing a symbol incorrectly will make the player lose health and causes several cells on the opponent's grid to automatically fill in.

The game also features a multiplayer mode for two player in which they can either try to solve a puzzle together or play against each other in a battle.</desc>

Tokoton is similar to Normal, but has all the animal amounts set to 100 before you'll level up.

Time Attack has you aiming to get the highest score possible in the time limit.  2P has two players battling it out against each other.</desc>

		<desc>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Arcade Attack is a modern take on the original Turtles arcade game. Unlike Konami's Turtle beat 'em ups, Arcade Attack is in fact 3D while attempting to play as though it were 2D but with a slightly isometric camera angle. The game can be played alone with a CPU ally or with a friend wirelessly with a selection of the four turtles, each with their own varying stats. Also much like Smash Up, while the game tries to blend both the new and the old TMNT universe all into one it leans a lot more heavily toward the new with its visual style and enemy selection.</desc>

		<desc>Contra 4 for the Nintendo DS is a direct sequel to 1994 SNES Contra III: Alien Wars. Two years after the defeat of Red Falcon - the first wave of the alien colonization fleet, the main invading force Black Viper approaches Earth. The heroes of the original Contra series - Billy Rizer and Lance Bean as well as two newcomers - Mad Dog and Scorpion are now humanity's last line of defense against total annihilation.

This installment of the long-running series adds dual screen gameplay, enabling the player a wider view, and a 2-player co-op mode via local Wi-Fi connection. Each player is now given two weapon slots which can be filled with any one of the game's many weapon power-ups and switched at will with a press of a shoulder button. The game features nine levels set in such classic Contra locations as Jungle, Waterfall and a pseudo-3D Base.
As a bonus, the cartridge contains an illustrated history of Contra, as well as the Contra and Super C original NES games.</desc>

		<name>Retro Game Challenge</name>
		<desc>Arino wants to be the greatest gamer in the world, but he's continually defeated by his friends at every new game that comes out. His obsession has spawned a digital version himself within his own Nintendo DS. This digital version of himself has come to be known as "Game Master Arino", who haunts gamers around the world with retro game challenges. You have been chosen by Game Master Arino, and are now trapped in the 1980s until you can defeat his game challenges.

Retro Game Challenge, based on the Japanese TV show Game Center CX, has you playing faithfully-recreated clones of popular NES-era games, attempting to complete challenges and freeing yourself from Game Master Arino. You are accompanied by Arino himself as a young lad, who will cheer you on as you're playing each game. You can also read the latest gaming mags for tips, cheats, and previews of upcoming titles.

There are eight games total, each modeled after 8-bit classics such as Galaga (Cosmic Gate), Dragon Warrior (Gaudia Quest), and Ninja Jajamaru-kun (Robot Ninja Haggle Man). Each game has multiple challenges from Arino to complete, such as clearing a certain stage or earning a set number of points, and can also be played in a free play mode once all challenges have been cleared.</desc>

		<path>./Arkanoid DS (USA) (En,Fr,De,Es,It).zip</path>
		<name>Arkanoid DS</name>
		<desc>The latest version of Taito's classic game: Arkanoid.
It features the classic gameplay of the previous games, the player controls the Spaceship VAUS (a moving platform at the base of the lower screen) and its energy ball to destroy the color block (in the upper screen) through each levels.
As usual, there are various power-ups to help through the game (laser, slow ball, duplicate balls, next level, etc.)

The game has one player mode, multiplayer and vs COM modes.

The one player mode consists of the Clear mode and the Quest mode.

The Clear mode is a series of 7 zones of 5 rounds each. There is a total of 28 zones in the game. At the end of the Clear modes, Ananke (the main character and pilot of the VAUS) frees one of his captured friends, these friend's VAUS can then be used in the game.

In the Quest mode, each previously played round is available to replay with a specific challenge (Break all blocks of one color within time limit, or ball launch limit, etc.) Each round gives points that can be used at the shop to buy in-game features to customize it (Blocks shapes, VAUS, backgrounds, etc.)

The VS Com and Multiplayer are similar. You must defeat either the Com or another friend in either Bust All or Bust Color match. The quickest to achieve the goal wins. There is also new power-ups that hinder the opponent.</desc>

		<name>Metroid Prime - Hunters</name>
		<desc>An episode in the Metroid Prime series which started on the GameCube, this game takes place between Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2: Echoes. Interstellar bounty hunter Samus Aran is sent to the distant Alimbic Cluster by the Galactic Federation to investigate a message saying that the source of ultimate power lies in this desolate part of the galaxy, once home to an advanced culture.

Samus is not alone, however. Other races have heard this mysterious message, too. Six other bounty hunters, each with unique characteristics, will do everything to get their hands on the Alimbic relics for their own reasons.

The single-player mode is more focused on shooting than other Metroid games but also has puzzles in classic Metroid fashion. Unlike previous games, Samus has all her moves from the start, but she still has to look for weapons. The player may also run into other bounty hunters in this mode.

The multiplayer mode is similar to Unreal Tournament or Quake games. Players can choose from any hunter that was defeated in single-player mode. There are seven modes in total including: Nodes, Survival, Bounty, Prime Hunter, Battle, Capture, and Defender. Each mode has its own unique rules. There are a vast number of arenas that can be played over local wireless or Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. When using friend codes, voice chat before and after matches is enabled.</desc>

Metroid Prime Pinball is a pinball game with a Metroid theme. Players can collect power-ups such as missiles and super bombs, which can be helpful when defeating bosses. There are also missions to be completed within a time limit; these missions can involve defeating unique enemies that appear on the table or completing tasks such as wall jumping. Completing missions earns either artifacts or special tokens.

The game also features a single-card multiplayer mode. In this mode, up to eight players can play. The game is a race to see who can reach a certain score first.
