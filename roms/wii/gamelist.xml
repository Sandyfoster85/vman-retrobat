		<name>Mario Party 8</name>
		<desc>Mario and friends are invited to the Star Carnival. Of course, they are thrilled to join. Whoever wins the main event, the Star Battle, receives a year's supply of candy. To win they must play through board games against each other. Mario and pals can also choose to play a more traditional party (much like other Mario Party games).  In the first Mario Party game for Wii, the basic rules are the same: players still compete to win stars. However, the mini-games have been completely revamped to take advantage of the Wii remote. For example, some have players point the remote at the screen to shoot guns or other such things. Other mini-games use the motion sensor to shake soda cans, cut logs in half, hammer nails in place, paint, fly planes, drive cars, etc. There are still others that are played more traditionally by holding the Wii remote on its side and using the control pad to move and the buttons to perform actions, such as jumping and/or punching.  Players can choose between five different modes: Party Tent, Star Battle, Mini-games, Extras Zone, or Fun Bazaar. In Party Tent mode, players play on boards with a choice between battle royales, teams, or duels. In a Battle Royale, people compete for stars: the winner is determined by number of stars and/or coins after a certain amount of turns. In Team Battle, players split off into teams. And in a duel, two players compete against each other.  Star Battle is basically a duel on each board against different characters (for one player). The player wins each board by completing a certain task. For instance, the player must collect so many stars on some boards. For other boards, he or she has to get to the star with a certain amount of coins.</desc>

		<name>The Legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess</name>
		<desc>Twilight Princess is the first Legend of Zelda game for the Wii and also the last for GameCube. At first Link is a simple farm boy, whose tasks consist of herding goats to watching children in Ordon village, Link's home town. One day, Link is asked by the mayor to run an errand in Castle Town, but things sudden go wrong?    The land becomes dark, and strange creatures appear from another world called the Twilight Realm, which turns most into ghosts. Link, however, becomes a wolf. After becoming a wolf, Link is aided by Midna, a resident of the Twilight Realm. Midna helps Link find a way to turn human again along with other tasks.    The wolf cannot use a sword or other items. Instead, as a wolf Link must use his senses to solve puzzles and get past obstacles. The beast can also dig holes to find hearts and rupees and to get in places. It can push blocks with its head to climb higher or reveal hidden passageways. Additionally, it can attack enemies by biting or pouncing on them.    As a human, Link can move around quickly, aim his bow, swing his sword, and even fish. Link also collects many different items, which allow him to perform varied attacks and reach places he couldn't before. Link performs many attacks with his sword and can even learn other sword moves.    The game's art is similar to the naturalistic style of Ocarina of Time, rather than the cel-shaded look of The Wind Waker. Chronologically, the game takes place between the two aforementioned titles and quite a few locations from Ocarina of Time can be visited. The main adventure takes place in several provinces with dungeons and temples. With the help of Midna, you can easily travel around quickly later in the game.</desc>

		<desc>Metroid: Other M is reminiscent of 2-D side-scrollers, but players can switch the perspective into 3-D at any time as they explore the twisting passages of a derelict space station and delve deep into a cinematic, never-before-told story of bounty hunter Samus Aran's past.    This new approach uses a new control scheme in which players use the Wii Remote controller held sideways to battle enemies and navigate the expansive, gorgeous environments in classic Metroid fashion, then aim at the screen with the Wii Remote pointer to blast foes in first-person and hunt the world for clues and hidden passages.</desc>

		<desc>The player takes on the role of the eponymous Jett Rocket, a planetary inspector who is tasked with stopping the Power Plant Posse (PPP) from polluting the Earth-like planet Yoroppa. The objective is to clear each stage within the planet's three areas: the lush and tropical Atoll, the glacial and snowy Northpole, and the toxic and jungle-like Swamps. Within each stage lies a set number of solar cells, many of which are scattered about and some of which are hidden, that Jett must collect in order to unlock each stage and gain access to the subsequent areas. Additionally, Jett must defeat a general of the PPP at the end of each area. As with standard platforming games, Jett is capable of jumping, but can briefly hover when using his jet pack. Within certain stages, he can also paraglide as well as either ride a hoverboard or a jetboat. In addition, Jett can defeat enemies, clear obstacles and activate switches with his "Dash" attack, which can be executed by shaking the Wii Remote while he is standing (which sees him perform a somersaulting tackle) or after a jump (which sees him perform a diving hammer fist). The game also features an achievement system that can be completed either during or after completion of the main story.</desc>

		<name>The Legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess</name>
		<desc>Twilight Princess is the first Legend of Zelda game for the Wii and also the last for GameCube. At first Link is a simple farm boy, whose tasks consist of herding goats to watching children in Ordon village, Link's home town. One day, Link is asked by the mayor to run an errand in Castle Town, but things sudden go wrong?

The land becomes dark, and strange creatures appear from another world called the Twilight Realm, which turns most into ghosts. Link, however, becomes a wolf. After becoming a wolf, Link is aided by Midna, a resident of the Twilight Realm. Midna helps Link find a way to turn human again along with other tasks.

The wolf cannot use a sword or other items. Instead, as a wolf Link must use his senses to solve puzzles and get past obstacles. The beast can also dig holes to find hearts and rupees and to get in places. It can push blocks with its head to climb higher or reveal hidden passageways. Additionally, it can attack enemies by biting or pouncing on them.

As a human, Link can move around quickly, aim his bow, swing his sword, and even fish. Link also collects many different items, which allow him to perform varied attacks and reach places he couldn't before. Link performs many attacks with his sword and can even learn other sword moves.

The game's art is similar to the naturalistic style of Ocarina of Time, rather than the cel-shaded look of The Wind Waker. Chronologically, the game takes place between the two aforementioned titles and quite a few locations from Ocarina of Time can be visited. The main adventure takes place in several provinces with dungeons and temples. With the help of Midna, you can easily travel around quickly later in the game.</desc>

He befriends the locals and, in return, they teach William new technologies and secrets to take back to his father's kingdom. However, the Sultan is suddenly kidnapped, and his aggressive sister takes over control of the Orient. She cuts all friendly relations with George's empire and expresses a desire to attack.

The objective is to clear each stage within the planet's three areas: the lush and tropical Atoll, the glacial and snowy Northpole, and the toxic and jungle-like Swamps. Within each stage lies a set number of solar cells, many of which are scattered about and some of which are hidden, that Jett must collect in order to unlock each stage and gain access to the subsequent areas. Additionally, Jett must defeat a general of the PPP at the end of each area. As with standard platforming games, Jett is capable of jumping, but can briefly hover when using his jet pack. Within certain stages, he can also paraglide as well as either ride a hoverboard or a jetboat. In addition, Jett can defeat enemies, clear obstacles and activate switches with his "Dash" attack, which can be executed by shaking the Wii Remote while he is standing (which sees him perform a somersaulting tackle) or after a jump (which sees him perform a diving hammer fist). The game also features an achievement system that can be completed either during or after completion of the main story.</desc>

		<name>Mario Party 8</name>
		<desc>Mario and friends are invited to the Star Carnival. Of course, they are thrilled to join. Whoever wins the main event, the Star Battle, receives a year's supply of candy. To win they must play through board games against each other. Mario and pals can also choose to play a more traditional party (much like other Mario Party games).

In the first Mario Party game for Wii, the basic rules are the same: players still compete to win stars. However, the mini-games have been completely revamped to take advantage of the Wii remote. For example, some have players point the remote at the screen to shoot guns or other such things. Other mini-games use the motion sensor to shake soda cans, cut logs in half, hammer nails in place, paint, fly planes, drive cars, etc. There are still others that are played more traditionally by holding the Wii remote on its side and using the control pad to move and the buttons to perform actions, such as jumping and/or punching.

Players can choose between five different modes: Party Tent, Star Battle, Mini-games, Extras Zone, or Fun Bazaar. In Party Tent mode, players play on boards with a choice between battle royales, teams, or duels. In a Battle Royale, people compete for stars: the winner is determined by number of stars and/or coins after a certain amount of turns. In Team Battle, players split off into teams. And in a duel, two players compete against each other.

Star Battle is basically a duel on each board against different characters (for one player). The player wins each board by completing a certain task. For instance, the player must collect so many stars on some boards. For other boards, he or she has to get to the star with a certain amount of coins.</desc>

		<desc>Billed as a re-imagining of the original Silent Hill, Shattered Memories once again casts you as Harry Mason searching across the haunted town for his missing daughter Cheryl. New to the series are a depiction of Silent Hill's demonic alter-dimension as a world of ice, and the removal of weapons from the game - when the monsters come out, Harry must literally run for his life.

Between scenes, the game will cut to a psychiatrist's office, who asks you personal questions about yourself and your past experiences. The game will then alter itself based on your responses, changing characters and lines of dialog to something intended to be more personally uncomfortable.

As you search for Cheryl, you will come across objects and recordings that tell some of the history of Silent Hill. The Wii Remote controls a flashlight aimed in real-time. Harry's cell phone accepts calls and messages from both the real and the supernatural, and a camera function is used to uncover hidden ghosts and their messages.</desc>

		<name>FIFA 10 World Class Soccer</name>
		<desc>Listening to feedback and addressing gamer frustrations has become a key part of the EA SPORTS strategy to improve the FIFA franchise on an annual basis.Better balance on lofted through balls, improved goalkeeper intelligence, more realistic shooting mechanics with less shots hitting the goal posts, a practice arena to perfect skills, and a more immersive football experience through continuous play and quick free kicks are just a few of the issues raised by fans and addressed in FIFA 10. Three new innovations revealed today have been developed to change the player control experience in FIFA 10. The first-ever true 360° dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. Using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. An innovative concept called Freedom in Physical Play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.FIFA 10 also features a deeper iteration of the ever-popular Manager Mode with more than 50 major improvements, including new match realism, realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player growth curves.</desc>

Unlike other Wii games, the main method of control is either through the classic controller or GameCube controller, since the action is wholly turn-based tactical combat, largely the same as the previous nine games. The game consists of 44 chapters and uses the same engine as Path of Radiance. There are three new weapon and magic types: Knife, Dark Magic and Strike. 
 
The player must lead a band of heroes against the Begnion Empire s oppression of the defeated Daein, along with help from many of the heroes from Path of Radiance. The members of the Dawn group are the main heroes of the game, with a major role for Sothe, who was a child thief from the previous Fire Emblem game.</desc>

Yin-Yarn, the evil sorceror who possessed the tomato (revealed to be a Metamato), appears and magically banishes Kirby into Patch Land, a world completely made of fabric, via the sock carried around his neck. In Patch Land, Kirby s body transforms into yarn, rendering his power to inhale useless. Instead, Kirby is granted the ability to transform by the magic of the Metamato, which he uses to rescue a boy being attacked by a monster. The boy, named Prince Fluff, explains that Yin-Yarn has separated Patch Land into pieces, which was tied together by magic yarn. Kirby decides to help Prince Fluff collect all seven pieces of the yarn and restore Patch Land. 
 
Meanwhile, Yin-Yarn captures King Dedede and Meta Knight and places them under his control. Kirby is forced to fight Dedede and Meta Knight after they ambush him in Patch Land. When Kirby and Prince Fluff finally collect all the Magic Yarn, Meta Knight, no longer under the sorceror s influence, informs Kirby that Yin-Yarn is turning Dream Land into fabric. Prince Fluff produces the second sock, its magic fully restored, and uses it to transport Kirby and himself to Dream Land; now completely made of yarn. Kirby confronts and defeats Yin-Yarn, breaking the spell and returning Dream Land and himself back to normal. Prince Fluff parts with Kirby, stating that he can visit Patch Land anytime via Yin-Yarn s magic sock.</desc>

		<desc>Embroiled in seemingly endless conflict, the Empire has been slowly weakened by the relentless onslaught of enemy forces. Despite the debilitated state of the mainland, however, a virtually impenetrable last line of defense stands proud and keeps hope alive for all the land. That beacon of hope is Lazulis Island, ruled by the renowned Count Arganan. With the employment of an army of weapons that magically ?and mysteriously-- concentrates beasts into a single region, his island has become a small wonder for its powers.

Among those coming to the island to seek their fortune is Zael, a young man who at an early age was orphaned when his homeland became one of the many victims of battle. Though he and his band of fellow mercenaries often face disdain and fear as they are perceived to be of a lower class, they manage to catch the eye of none other than Count Arganan himself. If they can successfully complete the tasks put before them by the Count, they may have a rare chance to gain the most honorable status that they have only dreamed of - knighthood.

It is during one of these missions bestowed upon them that Zael discovers a hidden site, one which grants him a wondrous and yet familiar power to gather his enemies in one place?</desc>

Keeping in line with the "world of dreams" theme . it wouldn t be Nights without it . players will take control of Will and Helen, two young children each entering into Nightopia (the world of dreams) with their own back-story, emotional baggage, and inner demons that come to life though the forming of nightmares. It s a pretty simple concept overall, and with each child s five main levels you ll get a different piece of the story leading up to the same grand finale. Once they arrive in the land of dreams, each character meets up with a Nights almost instantaneously, and from there learns to meld with the mysterious creature and fly through the world of Nightopia. Along the way you ll learn of the quest to find the hidden Ideya (basically essences of the human spirit), and eventually attempt to defeat a powerful god-like creature named Wizeman and his right-hand man Reala.</desc>

		<name>Super Mario Galaxy 2</name>
		<desc>Mario returns to the stars as the everlasting villain Bowser has kidnapped Princess Peach once more. This time while she was baking a cake...
Once again Mario is determined to fight Bowser and free Princess Peach. 

The basic goal of each level is to collect the golden star. The environment is still a mixture of standard Mario stages and miniature planetoids with their own orbital gravity. Throughout the game the perspective is changed at some stages, switching from 3D to 2D. The 2D part is similar to New Super Mario Bros. Wii.

Super Mario Galaxy 2 features a further improved experience over its predecessor, with two new suits for Mario and the return of Yoshi. Mario's first new suit is the Cloud Suit, which allows him to create three safe but temporary platforms. The second new suite is the Rock Suit. While wearing it, Mario can roll up into a ball which will be necessary to complete some challenges.
For the first time in the franchise Yoshi will be able to wear a suit as well. By finding it, he will become "Light Yoshi" that allows him to see certain platforms that are otherwise invisible.

Like in the original Super Mario Galaxy a second player can join the experience by pointing the Wii Remote on the screen to collect coins. What is new to the game however, is that the second player now also can collect items that are out of the reach of Mario.

To aid the entry for people new to the franchise, the game features an introduction to the game play and controls of the game.</desc>

		<name>Tetris Party</name>
		<desc>Tetris Party is a WiiWare edition of the traditional game of Tetris in a variety of modes, and it also introduces new modes such as Co-op Tetris and Duel Spaces. The standard tetris mode has a ghost shape at the bottom of the screen so you can see where the block will land, you can see the next four blocks and you can hold a block for later use.

In single player you can choose Marathon, Computer Battle, Field Climber, Shadow and Stage Racer.

Marathon is an endless game where you have to get as many lines as possible. Computer Battle is the same except against a computer opponent. Field Climber is a Lemmings-like, similar to the gameplay in Tetris Plus. A tiny person walks at the bottom of the screen, you have to help him climb all the way to the top by laying out blocks to form stairs, but be careful not to squash him. Shadow is a game where you have to fill in a shadow figure with blocks. You have to try to make a perfect overlap with no blocks outside the silhouette. In Stage Racer you have to manoeuvre a single block down a vertically scrolling screen. Move and rotate it so that it doesn't get stuck, because when it touches the top of the screen it's game over.

Multiplayer offers the following games: VS Battle, VS Field Climber, VS Hot Lines, VS Shadow, Co-op Tetris and Duel Spaces.

VS Battle, VS Field Climber, VS Hot Lines and VS Shadow are all battle versions of the single player games. You can gain power-ups that temporary freezes the opponents game or temporary stops them from rotating their blocks. In VS Hot Lines you have to clear certain lines indicated in green, which are typically not at the bottom of the screen. Once you clear a green line it disappears, clear all green lines to win the game. Co-op Tetris and Duel Spaces are both played in a larger area, 20 blocks wide. In Co-op Tetris two players work together to form lines. In Duel Spaces two players take turns dropping tetrominoes. Each player must try to seal off sections in the grid and capture as grid space as possible.

You can also play online in World Battle or Friend Battle using Wi-Fi, and you can play using the Wii Balance Board.</desc>

A Boy and his Blob is based on David Crane's Nintendo game of the same name.  As the nameless Boy, you have control over an alien blob who can transform into different objects when you feed him different flavored jellybeans.  The transformations are usually based on puns (for example, punch is a hole, apple is a jack and licorice is a ladder) or similar sounding names (such as tangerine trampoline and pear parachute).  Using the different tools that Blob can transform into, it's up to the player to reach the exit door at the end of each level.

Each level also has three hidden treasure chests in it.  If all three are found, a bonus level is unlocked.  The bonus levels are Challenge Levels, which are more difficult, and often based around using a specific skill or jellybean flavor.  Completing these levels unlocks special rewards such as concept art, videos and new game modes.</desc>

		<name>Battalion Wars 2</name>
		<desc>This sequel to Battalion Wars plays much like its predecessor, blending real-time strategy with third-person shooting. The game's plot traces decades of war among six factions (Solar Empire, Western Frontier, Anglo Isles, Iron Legion, Tundran Territories, Xylvania), and unfolds through contemporary missions that advance the conflict and flashback missions that reveal its history. 
 
Players control a soldier or a land, sea, or air vehicle to engage in combat directly and to command other units. The Wii Remote is used to target and fire, but selecting and ordering units is performed through conventional button presses. The Wii Nunchuk's thumbstick controls player movement, and evasive maneuvers are handled through gestures. 
 
In the single-player campaign mode, the player assumes control of the various factions at different points in the conflict's history. The game also features three online multiplayer modes. Skirmish mode is a timed two-player match to score more points than the other player by destroying opposing units. Assault mode is a timed two-player match in which one player attempts to destroy the other player's resources and fortifications while the other defends. Co-Op mode is an untimed two-player match in which both players work together to complete special online missions that are not part of the single-player campaign. Offline local multiplayer is not supported.</desc>

		<desc>20XX. A virus called Roboenza starts infecting robots, rendering them useless. Humankind would be helpless enough without the aid of their robot assistants - but the worst is yet to come! The second phase of the illness causes the infected robots to turn against their masters and try to take over the world! Dr. Wily claims to have built a medicine making machine to cure the epidemic, but it has been stolen by the berserk robots. Mega Man must fight eight violent robots to retrieve the machine and save the world.

Mega Man 10 retains the 8-bitish graphical style and gameplay of its predecessor Mega Man 9 and the old NES titles. The player must again jump, run and shoot his way through 8 stages filled with robotic enemies, destroy the Robot Master at the end of the stage and take his weapon to be used against further enemies.

Mega Man still can't slide or charge his weapon as he could in Mega Man 3 and 4, respectively, but you can also play as Proto Man who has both of these abilities as well as his trademark shield to block projectiles - however, Proto Man takes twice as much damage from enemy attacks. Bass will also be playable character via downloadable content, and will be able to aim his gun at 45-degree angles.

Like Mega Man 9, this game also features a Time Attack mode and Challenges, where the player must race against the clock or beat the game under certain conditions, such as never dying or beating all the bosses using only the standard Mega Buster weapon. The game also has separate Challenge Rooms, where the player must clear a room under different conditions given at the beginning of the Challenge.</desc>

Players can climb an area to get a better angle for the shot but risk being spotted, or they can take a low elevation route with poor visibility but plenty of concealment. Nature doesn't always wait for you to make the first move as the dynamic weather and natural hazards make the hunt even more challenging. The challenge doesn't end there. Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2012 ups the ante with the most realistic animals ever seen in the Cabela's series. Every animal's unique movement gives clues on what the animal will do next. In order to bag the trophies, players will have to avoid detection through cunning, skill, and deception. They must also utilize master hunting skills such as advanced stalking techniques so they can quickly move through cover and close in on their targets.</desc>

		<desc>The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword once again places the player in control of Link, a Hylian boy who this time around lives in the floating nation of Skyloft. Link is in love with a local girl called Zelda but one day while flying on their bird mounts, a tornado shows up out of nothing and takes Zelda away from Link. After that Link teams up with Fi, a spirit living within a sword and he descends to the long-forgotten surface to search for Zelda.

The game is structured very similar to previous Zelda games: you travel through an overworld in search of temples to visit and once in you solve a series of puzzles before fighting a boss at the end and receive the next bit of plot. The biggest change is that the overworld is more focused on puzzles this time around with only a handful of action. Also new is the implementation of the Wii Motion Plus which allows full 1:1 controls and new puzzle possibilities.</desc>

		<desc>Carnival Games (known in Europe and Australia as Carnival Funfair Games) is a video game for Nintendo s Wii console and the Nintendo DS. It was published by Global Star Software, before GSS was absorbed into Take-Two Interactive (and what is now 2K Play). 
 
Despite poor reviews by most gaming websites and critics, the game was a commercial success. The Wii and DS versions of the game have combined shipped over 7 million copies to date,[1] which according to the NPD Group, is the third best-selling third-party game on the Wii. 
 
As a result of the original s success, a follow-up for the Wii was announced, and launched in the fall of 2008, titled Carnival Games: Mini-Golf.[2] A proper sequel, New Carnival Games, was released on September 21, 2010 for the Wii and Nintendo DS.[3]</desc>

		<desc>A thousand years ago, Emperor Geardo of the Naga Empire sent an army of machine soldiers to invade the sky kingdom of Garuda. Thanks to the efforts of Princess Cecilia and Rodea, a machine soldier who promised to protect Garuda, Emperor Geardo s assault was thwarted. In present day, a spirited inventor named Ion discovers an abandoned robot that has fallen into disrepair in the heart of a scorching desert. Upon completing her repairs, the robot stirs to life and reveals itself to be none other than Rodea. Stunned to find himself in the future, Rodea learns that the Naga Empire is no more and that Garuda has known peace for a thousand years.

		<name>Rogue Trooper: Quartz Zone Massacre</name>
		<desc>A planned attack on Nu Earth goes wrong when a General turns traitor resulting in the massacre of Rogue s comrades. 
 
The game starts with Rogue and his comrades launched from a drop-ship. They come under fire from the Norts due to the information that had been leaked by the General. Upon landing the first mission is a tutorial in how to use Rogue s skills and also the Bio-chips of Gunnar and then Bagman. The third Bio-chip of Helm is received in a later mission. The Bio-chips have their own abilities. Gunnar is stuck to the side of Rogue s rifle and can be used as a sentry while Rogue flanks the enemy. Bagman provides ammunition and upgrades for Rogue s equipment made from salvage collected along the way and also looks after his health. Helm is used for accessing computer consoles and panels allowing Rogue access into prohibited areas. 
 
Rogue works his way through the various levels as stealthily as is possible trying to take the Norts by surprise with kill moves but with the arsenal at his disposal he is quite capable of also unleashing hell and going toe to toe with the enemy. Tracking the traitor General, Rogue eventually catches up in the final mission with an abundance of Norts trying to stop him.</desc>

The story is set between Episode II and III in which the player takes the role of either Obi-Wan, Anakin or Ahsoka Tano. During the course of the campaign he has to win one-on-one lightsaber battles against enemies like Count Doku. 
 
The controls are designed for the unique Wii controls which means the player needs to swing his Wii remote with the correct timing and the game converts it into in-game fighting moves. If the player performs certain hit combos which are different for every character the force meter fills up which can be used to hit the enemy with powerful force attacks. From time to time there is a quicktime event if the two sabers are in content: then the players have to perform given attacks.</desc>

Besides the normal straight and curved tracks there are also jumps, loopings, accelerators etc. to create custom racing challenges. 
 
This Wii version of the long-running PC racing series includes six background environments (stadium, coast, island, desert, snow and rally), each with a different car model (respectively the racing car, coupe, sports car, normal car, pickup and mini car). 
 
There are three modes: race mode, stunt mode and puzzle mode. In Race mode you simply have to finish a track in the fastest possible time. Each track has a predefined track record set by the programmers. There s a bronze, silver and gold medal time, which the player has to beat to earn those medals. In Stunt mode the tracks have a more acrobatic nature, and you have to finish them with as few restarts as possible. In Puzzle mode the player has to build a track connecting the fixed starting and finishing points using certain track blocks and then drive the track in the fastest time possible.</desc>

During the action players use the Wii Remote to direct objects and forces toward structures made of blocks in order to knock them over. There is also Jenga like gameplay during which players pull blocks, with the goal of toppling as many of them as possible, but without bringing down the whole structure. In doing this players have to deal with the different types of blocks in play. Some of these include: gem blocks, blocks with point values attached, explosive blocks that detonate on contact, vanishing blocks that disappear when struck, wood blocks, and steel blocks. In addition, as the game progresses strategies may change, meaning that players must be flexible in order to succeed.</desc>

The game s plot revolves around the personal stories and tragedies in the series, with its main focus on retelling the events of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil: Code: Veronica. 
 
A new chapter called Operation Javier fleshes out the plot further and explains the motives of Resident Evil 4 villain Jack Krauser. It takes place in 2002 and is set in the waterside village of Mixcoatl, located in the South American Amparo. It tells the story of Leon S. Kennedy teaming up with Jack Krauser to investigate the connections of crime lord Javier Hidalgo to a former Umbrella researcher. 
 
Just like The Umbrella Chronicles players do not control the character s movement, but only the shooting aspect, shown from a first-person perspective. The player s partner is also shown on the screen and there is an cooperative option for two players.</desc>

With this union, a void will engulf the entire universe as foretold by the book, the Dark Prognosticus. Before Luigi can stop Count Bleck, the villain escapes with an item known as the Chaos Heart. However, there is another book, called the Light Prognosticus, which can counteract the Dark Prognosticus. The Light Prognosticus foretells of a hero dressed in overalls. This hero is believed to possess the power to stop certain destruction of the universe.

Mario, joined by Peach, Bowser, and a new group of friends, must travel through eight worlds in search of Pure Hearts. Each character has a special ability, which can help the player solve the game's many puzzles. Mario can flip between the second and third dimensions in order to find items, secret pathways, and pound enemies. Peach can use her parasol to float long distances and to defend against enemy attacks. Bowser uses his fire breath to light things and to fry enemies.

Super Paper Mario does not fully depart from its RPG roots. For instance Mario and friends receive points from baddies. These points allow Mario and company to level up. Items can also be used to attack enemies or gain lives. Players collect coins to pay for more items.

Players can shake the Wii remote after jumping on bad guys but before hitting the ground to gain extra experience points. Players use Tippi, a Pixl, allowing them to point the remote at the screen to find secrets. Other Pixls, who help in other ways, can be found along the way. Pixls besides Tippi can be used by pressing the 1 button.</desc>

		<name>Flingsmash</name>
		<desc>FlingSmash is comparable to Wii Play, in that it is a title published by Nintendo to show off a bundled controller. Where Wii Play included the standard Wii Remote, FlingSmash is intended to show off the revamped Wii Remote Plus. This is essentially the Wii Remote featuring the Wii Motion Plus technology.

The game itself is a combination of pinball and table tennis; the player uses the controller to fling the ball-shaped character - Zip - into horizontally or vertically scrolling screens of blocks and items in order to smash them. Zip changes size and form in various situations, including a heavy steel ball.

The story revolves around this character, who needs to defend Sutton Island from an invader known as Omminus. There are eight regular stages to move through, each hiding five medallions for the player to find. Environments include the tops of tropical trees, grottoes under the sea, and beaches. Besides these regular stages, there are also eight extra stages and eight bonus mini-games.</desc>

		<desc>Up to four players, represented by Miis, compete against each other in a three round trivia contest. Players are given timed multiple choice answers, with players selecting their answers on their screen with the Wii Remote, with the fastest lock-ins with the correct answer resulting in bigger prize money. Players can also take their chances for greater rewards by spinning a wheel with both good and bad outcomes after each round. At the end of the third round, the two highest scoring players are pitted against each other in the Final Duel to determine the winner. 
 
This game features an elimination version, where a wrong answer eliminates you from the competition. There is also a 2-on-2 duel version and the return of the Quiz Attack for a solo player to see how many consecutive correct answers they can achieve.</desc>

		<name>Mario Kart Wii</name>
		<desc>Mario Kart Wii is an installment of the long-running Mario Kart series, but here for the Nintendo Wii, where you take control of various Nintendo characters to race through different tracks and win the Grand Prix, using a variety of vehicles and items spread through the track to help you.

There are various additions to the series. Players can now also play with motorbikes, which can do wheelies but are lighter and can't super boost, in contrast with karts. There's 6 varieties of each for each character class to choose from, and 4 new characters have been added as well as being able to drive with your Mii. Finally, there's 16 new tracks as well as 16 returning from previous games.

Gameplay has also been modified. Drifting has been tweaked so that it's easier to use and players only get a turbo boost based on how well they perform the drift. It can be set to Manual, where players press a button to drift, or Automatic, where it's automatically triggered on curves but provides no turbo boost. Stunts can also be performed in the air to gain turbo boosts. Races have also been bolstered to support up to 12 players now.

There's 4 modes of play to choose from: Grand Prix, where you race through series of tracks in the 50cc (karts only), 100cc (bikes only) and 150cc (karts and bikes) cups; Time Trial, where you take on ghost replays and try to finish in the least time; Versus, where you race against opponents on a single track; and Battle, where you can compete against your foes in either hitting them with weapons or collecting coins.

Multiplayer is also supported, allowing up to 4 players in hotseat and 12 online on Nintendo Wi-Fi, where you can take on strangers and friends (with Friend Codes) in any game mode, play in competitions, beat other's ghost replays or check online rankings. The game can be played using a Wii Wheel (included), Wii Remote, Nunchuck, Classic Controller, or Gamecube Controller.</desc>

		<name>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</name>
		<desc>Welcome to a brawl for the ages, where anything can happen, anyone can show up and all bets are off.Game storyline: In multiplayer games, characters from all Nintendo universes meet up in Nintendo locales to duke it out. In the solo mode called "The Subspace Emissary," the world of Smash Bros. is invaded by an entity called the Ancient Minister and his army of creatures, called "The Primid." Normally, characters come alive in the world of Smash Bros. to do battle, then turn back into trophies when defeated. However, the Ancient Minister starts turning characters into trophies to harness their power, then detonates bombs that suck pieces of the world back into his realm of Subspace. Eventually, all the characters must work together to defeat the invading creatures from Subspace - this is accomplished by playing through side-scrolling levels.How to progress through the game: For multiplayer games, players pick characters, set rules and locations for where they want to play and then duke it out. In Solo Mode, characters play through a long, side-scrolling adventure, beating up enemies along the way as they watch short cinematics starring their favorite characters.Characters: Mario, Samus, Bowser, Donkey Kong, Solid Snake, Meta Knight, Kirby, Pikachu, Zero Suit Samus, Link, Zelda, Pit and Wario, to name just a few. Anyone and anything from a Nintendo universe could appear in this game in one form or another.Special powers/weapons/moves/features: Anything from a Nintendo game could conceivably be in this game, whether it's a musical score, an obscure item or a character that shows up to help the fighters. Super Smash Bros. Brawl is eminently customizable, so players can choose the frequency of items appearing, adjust musical scores and basically play the game however they'd like. Items range from baseball bats to proximity mines to Poké Balls to Assist Trophies, which spawn characters like Hammer Bros. and Sim City's Dr. Wright to attack others.Super Smash Brawl Tournament WinnersLA Region Winner - David SegalSF Region Winner - Jason CaroMA Region Winner - Daniel JungNY Region Winner - Jensen SantiagoTournament National ChampionDaniel Jung * This action-packed fighting game features a ridiculous number of characters that have appeared on Nintendo platforms, from Mario to Link to Pikachu ... to Solid Snake!

		<name>Punch-Out!!</name>
		<desc>One of the biggest names in boxing returns after a 15-year hiatus. In Punch-Out!! you play as young up-and-coming fighter Little Mac who, with the help of his ringside trainer Doc Lewis, is working his way through the ranks of a wide variety of boxing caricatures, each with their own patterns of attacks. Grab a Wii Remote controller in one hand and a Nunchuk controller in the other and step back into the ring with a modern update of the classic Punch-Out!!Little Mac Is BackEveryone?s favorite underdog from the 1980s joins the best of the original Punch-Out!! cast in a modern re-imagining of the series. Players will find familiar names like Glass Joe, King Hippo and trainer Doc Louis. These boxers come to life again in cell-shaded 3-D, complete with hilarious fighting animations and back stories that capture all the fun and flair of the original Punch-Out!! games.The Wii's Motion SensitivityThe motion-sensitive controls of the Wii console mean that when players throw punches, Little Mac throws punches as well. Additionally, you can control hooks and jabs by combining motion control with control-stick movement. The motion-sensing Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers turn real-life swings into on-screen punches, so anyone can play. The game can also be played with classic NES-style controls by turning the Wii Remote sideways.CharactersPunch-Out!! features a total of 13 opponents for Little Mac to step into the ring with. 12 of which are returning from previous games in the Punch-Out!! series. Each has their own back story and patterns of attacks to learn and learns to counter. Just a few of the characters you can expect to see are:Little MacSmall but extremely game, Little Mac is a young, up-and-coming fighter, who with the help of his trainer, ex-champion Doc Lewis, has set his sights on working his way through the ranks.Glass JoeA fearful French fighter due to his extremely weak chin, Glass Joe will crumple to the mat quickly with just a few well-placed shots, making him an easy mark and a good warm-up for the fighters to follow.King HippoKing Hippo is both huge and an immensely powerful fighter, but can be weakened with the right combinations to the head and body, giving you time to go for the knockout if you can survive his onslaught.Von KaiserAn old-timey fighter whose rumored childhood difficulties have left him eager to dish out punishment in the ring, Von Kaiser is a dangerous opponent, but one who will turn tail if you can find his weakness.Special AttacksPlayers can obtain special 'Star Punches,' which allow Little Mac to take more health from his rival in a single punch. Players can now use multiple stars in a single punch for an extra-powerful attack.Controller OptionsPunch-Out!! features multiple controller options. For players looking to take advantage of the Wii's motion control capabilities, Punch-Out!! uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers to simulate throwing punches. Use the Nunchuck to throw a left punch and the Wii Remote to throw a right punch. Fans of the NES version and core gamers will be excited to see Nintendo has also included the option to play Punch-Out!! using the classic layout from the original NES controller. Use the 1 and 2 buttons along with the cross pad to throw hooks and jabs or to dodge.</desc>

		<desc>Based on ancient Japanese lore, Muramasa: The Demon Blade plunges players into the mystical Genroku era, ruled by the skilled shogun Tsunayoshi Tokogawa. But this culture is threatened; Tokogawa's thirst for power leads to a conflict over the enormously powerful, though cursed, Demon Blades. Used in hatred, drenched in blood, the cursed blades condemn those who use them to tragedy, madness and ultimately deaths. As chaos spreads, denizens from the netherworld breach their realm as these malevolent swords summon evil spirits - and the Dragon and Demon Gods as well. Featuring hand-drawn 2D art reflecting the heritage and tone of the storyline, Muramasa transports plauers into a little known mythology, envisioned by the creators of the critically acclaimed Odin Sphere. Players take on the role of a male ninja or female kunoichi, utilising their ninja prowess to traverse the clever side-scrolling levels that feature vertical progression as well as the traditional horizontal stage advancement.Features:* From the subtle movements of a character's clothes to their explosive battle animations, every detail is expertly animated by hand for amazing visuals* Playing as a male ninja or female kunoichi, a wide variety of ninja skills are at your disposal as you progress through levels horizontally and vertically* Gameplay transitions seamlessly from player-controlled elements to story sequences to keep the player engaged within the world* Take a journey through a tale influenced by the lesser-told, but equally rich and mysterious, Japanese mythology</desc>

The game can be controlled using one of four control methods: Wii Remote with Nunchuk, Wii Zapper, Classic Controller (as well as the Classic Controller Pro) and the Nintendo GameCube Controller. Playing as either Isa or Kachi, the player traverses through on-rail levels, moving and shooting independently. Attacking enemies can either be shot at from afar, or melee attacked when they are close enough. Some missiles can be melee attacked to turn them against enemies. Getting successive enemy hits whilst remaining unscathed increases the score multiplier.</desc>

		<name>New Super Mario Bros. Wii</name>
		<desc>Princess Peach has been kidnapped!  Again!  Everyone was celebrating the Princess' birthday when a giant birthday cake arrived... but then Bowser Jr. and the seven Koopalings popped out and kidnapped her!  Mario, Luigi and two Toads make chase to rescue her once more.  Will they succeed?

New Super Mario Bros. Wii is a continuation of the Super Mario Bros. games.  As with the original, players jump, dash and grab power ups such as the Super Mushroom and the the Fire Flower, which lets them throw fireballs at their foes.  New powerups have been added too - the Propeller Hat allows players to zoom vertically up in the air, and then glide back down, the Ice Flower lets players freeze enemies into icy blocks, and the Penguin Suit gives them traction on ice as well as allowing them to belly slide.  Yoshi, from Super Mario World makes a return, as well - players can ride him and he'll eat enemies and berries in levels.

The Wii Remote's tilting feature is used to activate certain parts of levels - for example, jumping onto specific platforms and tilting the Wii Remote will angle the platform too.  Another level has players aiming a light on a boat by using the Wii Remote so that they're not lost in the dark.  Shaking the Wii Remote while wearing the Propeller Hat causes the player to fly straight up, while shaking it near objects picks them up or throws them.

The game has a special feature known as a 'Super Guide' - when a player dies eight times in total in a level, a special block appears at the start of the stage the next time they play.  If the player hits this block, Luigi will take over and play through the level, showing them how to complete it.  This allows players to progress through the game even if they are having trouble on a particularly difficult level.

Up to four players can play simultaneously.  When playing together, as long as one person is on-screen in a level, players can keep returning in-game after they die by floating in a bubble which is then popped.  If all players lose their lives, they are sent back to the map screen.  Another mode, Coin Battle, has all players versus each other, with the aim being to pick up the most coins while heading toward the goal.</desc>

		<desc>S.O.P.H.I.A. returns to save the Earth in this new 2D update in the long-running Blaster Master series. This new installment updates the classic NES game with a new action/adventure and re-imagining of the original frog-rescuing quest.  

In this entry, the role of saving the Earth now resides in a biologist named Alex, who must investigate why a mysterious virus is mutating the planet's animals and placing the humans in a coma-like sleep... including his wife and child.  Alex must travel to the center of the Earth to restore S.O.P.H.I.A.'s missing upgrades, and fight the various mutants and bosses to proceed to new areas.

Gameplay is similar to the original game.  Vehicle "Overworld" exploration levels are set as a 2D side-scroller that opens up the 8 different world areas more (similar to other titles as the modern Castlevania and Metroid games) once the player collects the necessary upgrades.  

Alex may also leave the vehicle to go on foot in order to explore the various caves and fight bosses in a 3/4 overhead perspective.</desc>

As the Mushroom Kingdom prepares to celebrate the arrival of a comet that appears in the skies every hundred years, Princess Peach sends Mario an invitation to attend. As Mario arrives, Bowser and minions attack the Kingdom and once again kidnap the Princess... and her entire castle. Mario gives chase but is lost as the ship leaves the atmosphere and ends up on a space station built on the visiting comet overseen by the mysterious Rosalina. It's up to Mario to brave new galaxies, find the elusive Power Stars, and bring his friends home.

Super Mario Galaxy plays similarly to Super Mario 64, as Mario explores his latest 3D world defying gravity, crossing various terrains, and even running upside down across the planet surfaces. Bouncing from planet to planet, Mario must collect Star Bits and coins, using his usual jump attacks and spins (now controlled with movement from the Wii Remote). The Wii Remote is also used to collect out of reach Star Bits and also can be controlled by a second player.

In addition, Mario can find new suits (similar to Super Mario Bros. 3) that give him the ability to turn into the ghostly Boo Mario, the high-flying Bee Mario, launch fireballs as Fire Mario and skate across frozen lakes as Ice Mario. New challenges also await Mario including ray surfing, balancing on a high-speed ball, floating inside bubbles, and other challenges in his quest to get all 120 stars. Even Luigi lends a hand in the search, making valuable contributions to the adventure.

Players can also take a snapshot of the worlds they've completed along with their best record times and send them to their friends via Wi-Fi.</desc>
