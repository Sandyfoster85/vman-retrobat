		<desc>A graphic dungeon quest inspired by the old mainframe game of the same name, Adventure is a graphic action-adventure game where you use your joystick to wander around, collecting keys to explore castles, labyrinths and everything in between, whilst slaying anything that moves (i.e. Dragons &amp; Co.) to get treasures. 

The game has 3 difficulty settings:Level 1 (Easiest)Level 2: The Kingdom is larger than Level 1, containing secret rooms and hidden items to add difficulty.Level 3 (Hardest): Similar to Level 2 but all objects/items are placed randomly throughout the Kingdom.Gameplay revolves around picking up (and dropping) items, hacking your way though dragons, finding keys to open the castle gates and using magic (i.e. reincarnation) in case you get swallowed by failing-to-follow-their-diet-plan-dragons.</desc>

		<name>Akalabeth</name>
		<desc>Once, the land of Akalabeth was peaceful and quiet. But then came Mondain, an evil and ambitious man who created dungeons and populated them with foul creatures. The noble warrior British was able to drive Mondain from Akalabeth, but the monsters he brought with him remain.

As either a fighter or a mage, it is your job to explore Akalabeth, descend into the dungeons and vanquish the beasts dwelling within. On an overhead map of the land, one can find the dungeons, towns where one may buy supplies, weapons and armor, and a castle, where one will be given quests by Lord British. To fulfill such a quest, a certain type of creature must be destroyed in a dungeon.

Inside the dungeons, the view switches to a first-person perspective. Fight, explore and find treasure on your way to complete a quest. Each successive quest will require you to destroy a stronger monster, which will reside on a deeper dungeon level than the one before it.

Akalabeth is the precursor to the Ultima Series.</desc>

		<name>Alcazar the Forgotten Fortress</name>
		<desc>In this adventure game you control an explorer who's on his way to fortress Alcazar. To reach Alcazar you are travelling through a countryside of fortresses and you need to collect several items that you can find along the way.
Once you enter the Alcazar fortress you have to search for the crown.

The strategy map gives you an overview of the countryside, it's fortresses and your location in it.
What perils lurk in these mysterious castles? Which path is 
quick and safe?
The Alcazar castle is three stories high, all other castles have only two stories. To enter a castle you just have to follow the path.
Each castle has it's own sought-after objects and these objects are always guarded by the castles main demon.
Objects to look for are for example: a rope, a gun, raw meat, water or a raft. Collect them and use them properly to master
the legendary Alcazar fortress.

The game gives you clues and tells,  for example, which monsters are nearby. Some monsters are really hard to kill.

The game can be played at four difficulty levels.</desc>

		<path>./Alice In Wonderland (1985)(Windham Classics)(Save).dsk</path>
		<name>Alice in Wonderland</name>
		<desc>Alice in Wonderland is an adventure platformer based upon the two Alice books by Lewis Carrol and created using the same engine as Below the Root.  However, whereas that game had more of a focus on role playing, Alice has more of a focus on puzzle solving.

Puzzles come in a variety of forms including many inventory based puzzles, and more appropriately, given the subject matter, riddles.  Also, there are many physical puzzles primarily taking the form of how to get from here to there through jumping and using inventory items to change Alice's size.  

The plot is more inspired by the Alice books than strictly adapting them.  Especially the game tries to adapt Carrol's sense of humor in its rhymes and puns. Interestingly, Alice's end of conversations are driven by selecting emotions rather than typing words, and it is possible to anger NPCs and have them stalk off, leaving you to wait until a pre-appointed hour when they will reappear.  The time can be discovered by looking at one of the various clocks throughout the game.  Time is important because the game must be completed before the Red King wakes, although this isn't much of an issue especially since the game can be saved whenever and mistakes easily taken back.</desc>

It is a shoot-'em-up where a formation of alien ships attack your lone starship at the bottom of the screen.  The aliens peel off from the formation and attack you in different patterns, depending on the color of the ship. The two ships at the top are the motherships and they bring an escort of two red aliens with them to guard them, but if you can shoot the escort and then the mothership, you'll score lots of points.</desc>

		<name>Apple Panic</name>
		<desc>Apple Panic is a platform game based on the arcade game Space Panic (1980, Universal) and ported to the Apple II by Ben Serki. You control a digger, armed with his shovel, and you must kill your opponents - the evil legged apples.

Your character can only walk left/right and climb up/down the ladders - no jumping - and if the apples touch you, you'll lose.

To kill an apple you must dig a hole on the ground and wait for one of them to get stuck on it. Then you must hit it with your shovel to make it fall to the level below. The apples die if they fall deep enough. Depending on their color, they may require from 1 to 3-level falls, so you may have to dig several aligned holes. Besides, the deeper the fall, the higher you score.

Each level is timed so you must take out all the apples quickly, or you'll lose. If you're successful, the next levels will feature more and more enemies than the previous one.</desc>

While the worms can pass through the tongue and only cause aardvark?s death when being directly in touch with his tip of the tongue, other critters will instantly kill the player upon touching any part of the tongue. The lowest levels of the underground area usually have two special objects which clear out the whole screen from enemies if touched by Ardy?s tongue.</desc>

The player attacks them with two anti-jet guns on the ground and has to kill them off before the city's protecting force field is destroyed. In the third round the Argonians attack the city streets with missiles, bombs, spaceships and parachuters. The player controls a tank left and right and has to shoot missiles at the enemies.</desc>

		<name>Arkanoid</name>
		<desc>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.

The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.

By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the bolt down.</desc>

		<name>Asteroids</name>
		<desc>Unlike Activision's earlier remake of an Atari arcade classic, Battlezone, this one stays close to its namesake.  Take the original, Atari coin-op game Asteroids, add in the features of the Atari 2600 cartridge, then give it 3-D graphics and a bunch of power-ups, and you've got Activision's Asteroids remake.

You are an employee of the Astro-Mining Corporation.  Your mission is to simply go to an assigned area of space and clear the area of asteroids and the occassional debris.  The game consists of five zones, each with a different background and some with special features.  Each zone has 15 levels.  In addition to the standard asteroids, there are also mined asteroids that explode; indestructible asteroids that are, well, indestructible; fireball comets; crystal asteroids that regenerate; alien egg asteroids containing deadly baby space worms; and ancient energy asteroids that shoot back!  And there's plenty of enemies in addition to the asteroids, such as Standard and Super Saucers, Asteroids Tugs, Fuel Transports, Hexes, Nuke Drivers, and Vulturoids.

There are three types of ships to choose from, each with different strengths and weaknesses.  There are also three skill levels.  If you beat the game at Expert or higher, you gain access to a fourth type of ship.  All ships features the standard laser, shield, flip (instantly flips your ship 180 degrees), and hyperspace.  There are also limited power-ups you can  pick up such as GunSat, Mines, Homing Missiles, Plasma Drill, and Trigger Bombs.

The game supports either one or two players.  In two player mode, the object is to simply outscore your opponent in a random zone and level.  You cannot directly kill your opponent by shooting him, but there are other ways....

Lastly, if you shoot the classic-style asteroid in level 15 of the first zone, you'll find the option of "Classic Asteroids" now appearing on the main menu.</desc>

		<desc>ATC is a text-mode Air Traffic Controller game. Aircraft appear periodically and must be directed to the correct exit gate according to their flight plan. Aircraft can be given direct commands (e.g. turn left), relative commands (e.g. turn towards exit #2), or delayed commands (e.g. at beacon #1, turn left), as well as commands to adjust altitude. As the game progresses, more planes will enter the control area at a time. The game does not end; the goal is simply to direct as many planes as possible to their desired exit. As soon as a mistake is made, the game ends.</desc>

		<path>./Aztec (1982)(-)[cr].dsk</path>
		<name>Aztec</name>
		<desc>Aztec is an Indiana Jones-type action game with adventure elements, featuring our hero's quest to recover a valuable Jade Idol from a maze. Armed with only three sticks of dynamite and a pistol, the hero must get by traps, animals (lots of snakes and panthers), and natives, and find a way to make it out alive.

The value of the Idol is set on the level of difficulty and declines as the game progresses. Thus, the player is awarded with the speed of which a successful recovery can be made. Multiple commands allow for freedom of movement, and expand the adventuring side of the game. The animation used several frames for each creature.

Although the game is somewhat easy on the lower levels of difficulty, the game appears impossible on the highest of the 8 skill levels. The creatures in the maze increase in number and speed, and tend to want to follow you around more. This is difficult however if you want to go to the lower level and there's a hungry jaguar waiting for you.

You walk around exploring boxes and "trash piles". Sometimes a box contains something useful such as a machete, pistol, bullets, dynamite, a health potion, or the idol. Sometimes it contains skulls or bones, or even nothing at all. 

The game features some unusual traps. You can walk into a room and the walls start moving in on you, or the ceiling starts dropping on your head. When you die, you have the option of restarting using the maze you just died in. That way, all of your exploring is not wasted.</desc>

The game operates on several levels, and the player will be required to act as a pilot, copilot, navigator, engineer and bombardier at different stages of each mission. The performance of your B-24 influences the effectiveness of your Group, Wing and ultimately the Air Force itself. B-24 is a simulator with a difference - you control your bomber (and the Group) from a top-down perspective rather than from a 1st person perspective.</desc>

		<name>Balance of Power</name>
		<desc>The year is 1986. You take on the role of the US President or the Russian General Secretary. You have the full industrial capacity, covert forces, and military might of your country at your command. Your job? To make your country the world's most powerful and prestigious over the course of your eight years in office. Sounds easy, doesn't it? It would be if the other guy didn't have his finger poised over a red button that could wipe out the world! 

You must use diplomacy, make treaties, issue risky, covert CIA or KGB actions, or riskier, direct military intervention to prop up third world countries or help their insurgents and win them to your governmental philosophy: Capitalism or Communism. The world is a big place... and the other guy could start a nuclear war over a country as tiny as Tunisia. This game is the ultimate Cold War simulation. Every action requires careful analysis and the ability to judge your opponent (computer or human) and his reaction. The game features 62 countries, each carefully researched with up to date (as of 1985) information regarding their government, demographics, resources, etc.</desc>

		<name>Ballblazer</name>
		<desc>In the year 3037, the most competitive sport in the known universe is Ballblazer. For the first time ever, humans from the planet Earth have won the right to compete in the final round of the Ballblazer Championship, to fight for Earth's honor and the title Masterblazer!

Ballblazer is a 3D futuristic soccer-like game, where the player (inside a Rotofoil) is set on a one-on-one 1,155 square playing field (the Grid). The objective of the player to kick a floating ball (Plasmorb) inside the opponent's goal (Goalbeams). A player may compete against a human or computer opponent.

The Rotofoil is equipped with a multi-purpose forcefield. This forcefield when in short distance of the Plasmorb will act as a pull field, automatically pulling the Plasmorb towards the player. When a player in possession of the Plasmorb shoots, the forcefield will act as push field and launches the ball. When the match starts, the player must move down field and attempt to gain possession of the Plasmorb using the joystick and blast the Plasmorb to an intended direction. 

The player should also be aware that the Goldbeams move slightly every second and the distance between them will shrink. The highest scoring goals are goals made when Goldbeams have disappeared across the horizon (Over The Horizon/OTH shots). A player may also attempt to steal possession of a Plasmorb by rushing beside the opponent and blast the Plasmorb away. The game ends when time runs out or a player wins 10 consecutive goals. If the game ends in a draw, over-time will apply and the first player to score will win the game.

Scoring
Close-in goals - 1 point
Goals near Goldbeams - 2 points
OTH shots - 3 points
Players may steal points from each other by making goals. 
The total combined score of both players cannot accede more than 10 points.
A player winning 10 consecutive points automatically wins the game.</desc>

		<desc>Battle of Hoth is a Star Wars themed 1-player arcade game for the Apple II.

Three columns of Imperial AT-AT walkers walk inexorably from the right of the screen towards the Rebel defensive positions on the left. The player controls a Rebel snowspeeder, which travels from the left to right of the screen, and can fire horizontally to the right. The player can move the snowspeeder vertically up and down, and must avoid fire from the AT-ATs and shoot them down. Whenever an AT-AT is destroyed, a new AT-AT immediately appears to the right of the screen in that row. The player's goal is to survive for 300 seconds to allow for the evacuation of Rebel forces. If an Imperial vessel reaches the left of the screen, the Rebel forces are routed, and the player loses the game. The player starts with a total of 9 snowspeeders, and if all are lost to Imperial fire, it's game over.</desc>

		<name>Beast War</name>
		<desc>Beast War is for 1-4 players, however you always play against the computer. You direct the movement of six different semi-intelligent beasts on a circular, 43 space field; Just like the Star Wars chess scene on the Millenium Falcon. In each round of a battle, your goal is to max your score by destroying opposing beasts and capturing squares. 

Each beast has its own movement pattern, energy level, strength, and unique advantage over one other beast. (Dracon can burn the winged Aeroctus to cinders but fears the bite of the Saurus.)  Any move consumes energy, so it is a resource you need to manage closely. Combats are shown in a small action sequence where each beast may advance, strike, or retreat.</desc>

		<desc>In The Bilestoad, players control "meatlings" that hack and battle with axes and shields from a top-view perspective. The name is derived from the German words Beil (axe) and Tod (death). The odd spelling reflects Goodman's idea of a future language similar to A Clockwork Orange's Nadsat in which English has been modified by the borrowing of foreign words. Although the game may seem medieval, the backstory in the manual explains that the axe fighting is actually a future virtual reality game designed to reduce real violence.</desc>

German battleship Bismarck is attempting to elude the Allied fleet in order to escape from the North Atlantic and be able to conduct shipping raids against Allied supply convoys. The player can take command of either the British or German side. You can conduct air searches on the map, read weather forecast, move your ships, fire their deck guns and torpedoes, control repairs during battle. You can also fly Fairey Swordfish and make a torpedo run. Germans win if Bismarck safely escapes south or returns to France after sinking enemy ships.</desc>

		<name>Black Belt</name>
		<desc>In this game, you play Riki. Kyoko, your beautiful Japanese girlfriend, has been kidnapped, and in order to rescue her, you must get through a tireless army of enemies. These enemies come equipped with weapons that include whips, knives, swords, and flamethrowers, but Riki has to make do with his well-trained martial arts body.

Black Belt is a side-scrolling game that is split into seven chapters. During these chapters, you are fighting Chinese Kung Fu men, wrestlers, jujitsu men, eagles, ninjas, and black women. When you get halfway through the chapter, you will fight a different enemy than one that you encounter before. At the end of each chapter, you have to defeat several bosses before continuing on to the next round. Each type of these has their own personal strengths and weaknesses.

Once you touch an enemy or boss, you will lose energy. once you lose all energy, you lose a life, but more life can be restored by getting the cake when it comes across the screen in mid-air, or by defeating an enemy that will come at you halfway and you receive a bonus for doing so.

The game is a modified version of the Japanese-exclusive Hokuto no Ken, with the licence removed and new level designs.</desc>

		<desc>In Black Magic your job is to move a little wizard using the joystick and collect up the diamonds in the upper and underworlds and fill baskets with them and then successfully find the exit to the level. 

Besides the standard blue diamonds, if you happen to collect a green diamond, the enemies stand still momentarily. A four-carat diamond counts as four diamonds which happens to be the maximum number of diamonds that you can carry, which makes it much faster than collecting them individually. Either find your four diamonds and exit or stay and eliminate all of the enemies before exiting the level.

Collect helpful extras along the way to make your job easier. A shovel to help clear the way. A shot to destroy your enemy with one shot. A special shot will allow your shots to keep rebounding of the walls until they hit an enemy or until you intercept the shot. Lightning to destroy enemies to your right and left. Like fruit? A strawberry gives you an energy boost, a grape gives you 40 bonus points, while an apple can destroy an enemy if you are able to get it to fall on top of them. Are you up to the challenge?</desc>

		<name>Blitzkrieg</name>
		<desc>Blitzkrieg is a real-time strategy game with three campaigns during World War 2. During the campaigns the player keeps its core army of tanks and guns. In the missions there are additionally units provided by the game, including infantry and air units. There is a description of all units in the game, even if the units cannot be commanded by the player. The three campaigns are:
Allies (US, UK, French) fighting in Europe and Africa
German fighting in Europe, Africa and Russia
Soviet Union fighting in Russia and afterwards in Europe
The campaigns include historical battles like the battle of Kursk and optional bonus missions, which can be played to:
Get experience for the profile of the player to increase the rank of the profile. A higher rank leads to a larger core army.
Get experience for the units in the core army, so that the units become deadlier.
Exchange weapons to newer types.
During a mission the losses are never replaced, losses in the core army are replaced after missions. For the repairing and rearming of units depots have to be conquered, where the service trucks load their resources.  All depots have unlimited resources. 

The game itself has a 2D graphic, but uses a 3D terrain with a full destructible environment. Buildings can be occupied by infantry to use them as cover. The game includes maps for multiplayer matches over LAN or the internet.</desc>

		<name>Bolo</name>
		<desc>Bolo is a "Breakout" clone with a twist. You have to destroy all the bricks on the screen using your paddle to go to the next level but, in Bolo, your paddle is not restricted to the bottom of the screen -- it can move all around the screen, giving a whole new dimension to the "breakout" concept.

The game includes two different sets of 50 levels each, randomly selected when you begin a new game. It also features 46 different types of bricks with different properties, bonuses and penalties. 

The main menu allows you to access Training mode, from which you can select to play any of the 100 available layouts.

Bolo's graphics are black and white only, but the game can be played either on a monochrome or color monitor. The graphics are however much sharper on a monochrome monitor. The animations are fast and smooth, and the paddle reacts quickly to the mouse movements.</desc>

		<desc>Bomb Alley is an operational level wargame built upon improved engine from Guadalcanal Campaign. It focuses on the battles between the British and Axis air, land and naval forces for control of the Mediterranean and North Africa in 1942, during the World War 2. There is a campaign game covering June 11 - August 31, 1942 and short scenarios covering the invasion of Crete in May 1941 and Operation Pedestal in August 1942. Each game turn represents the passage of 12 hours. A game turn consists of reinforcing your troops, moving troops into position, launching air missions and combat resolution. The map is a 40x40 grid representing the Mediterranean area. Victory points are computed at the end of each game.</desc>

		<desc>The company behind Way of the Exploding Fist and Fighting Warrior also tried its hand at wrestling, with this game claiming to be the first 3D combat sports game, in which you can avoid the opponent by moving up or down the screen as well as left or right.

Like any fighting game worth its salt, the game can be played with one or two players. In one-player mode there are 10 opponents to take on in sequence.

The moves on offer include almost everything you'd find in real wrestling (and I don't mean WWE) - piledrivers, arm twists, body slams and turnbuckle flies, all of which are fully animated. The whole experience includes detailed multi-colour graphics and a full rock soundtrack.</desc>

Borg is a slightly more complex version of Stern's Berzerk arcade game. The player navigates a number of one-screen mazes, attempting to shoot all enemies while avoiding enemy fire and touching the walls. If it takes too long, the evil Grud will yell, "BORG!" and chief dragon Borg will come out, yell "RUN!", and hunt and kill the player, just like Evil Otto in Berzerk.</desc>

High Noon is set in the old west and involves a shootout outside a saloon. Enemies will pop out from covers, doors and windows and the player simply has to shoot them before they shoot. The player is equipped with two revolvers and each is aimed and shoot individually using paddles.

Duck Hunt is a two player game that is played with just a single button. It's viewed from the side where the shooters are located on the ground while ducks fly across the screen above them. Each shooter fires from its own angle and all the player has to do is time the shot. The player with most hits after ten rounds wins the game.</desc>

In each level you must collect a certain number of these diamonds, in order to open a portal to the next stage. Enemies can be squashed by falling boulders, which are released when the ground below them is removed or they are pushed onto empty ground, but be careful because these can also squash you. In later levels, difficulty is increased by many puzzle elements and shorter time limits.

There are 16 levels to be completed and five different skill levels available, which affect the number of jewels which must be collected and the time limit.</desc>

		<path>./Broadsides (1983)(SSI).dsk</path>
		<name>Broadsides</name>
		<desc>Broadsides is a tactical simulation of ship-to-ship combat between sailing ships of the Napoleonic era (late 18th and early 19th Century). The game can be played as two different games. The first game is an arcade mode where you can sail right into the action, set your course, maneuver, and fire your guns as fast as your crew can load. For authenticity and historical detail, the tactical game puts you on the quarterdeck where you will make all the decisions real captains had to make.

 If you wish to depart from the historical ships provided, you can design your own frigates and ships of the line from the keel up to rigging, arming and manning them. The game ends when either ship wins or at 6pm, whichever comes first. You will win if you sink the enemy ship, or accumulate enough points to force the enemy ship to surrender. You will lose if your crew size goes below one quarter of its original size or if 11 enemy crew members manage to board your ship and there are no standing friendly crew members occupying any of the first 10 boarding positions on your ship. If both ships sink, or no one wins by 6pm, the game is a draw. The game can be played by two players or against the computer.</desc>

		<name>Bug Attack</name>
		<desc>Bug Attack is a colorful shoot-em-up where you are assaulted by dagger-throwing millipedes, ants, and med flies. The game looks similar to the arcade game Centipede, but plays quite differently. 

In the first waves, you are a spider in a desert surround by cacti. First the ants come at you, wandering back and forth randomly between the cacti and chucking daggers at you if you get under them. If you dispatch the ants, you get to fight the millipede, which advances row by row, not stopping for anything including the plants (or your spider). It also throws daggers from time to time as it advances. The third wave pits you against the deadly med flies, which dance in a line around the screen. If you don't shoot them fast enough, they start to break off from the group, dancing wildly and raining daggers down upon you. Finish this last wave and you get bonus points for the amount of fuel you have left and get treated to a small interlude where a chorus of bugs sings to you as a med fly pollinates a flower.

The second and third levels are similar to the first, except that they are tougher. The second wave takes place in a clover patch and the third wave puts you in the flower garden. The second and third waves also have tough bonus levels at the end. Once you finish the flower garden you begin all over again back in the desert, but the enemy is much more numerous and difficult this time around.</desc>

There are 4 scenarios covered in this game, Midway, Coral Sea, The Battle of the Eastern Solomons and The Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. Every major warship and plane is accounted for and accurately detailed.

Each game turn represents one hour of action. The computer handles all the administrative chores while you give the orders and plot strategy. The game can be played by up to two people or in solitaire where the computer plays the Japanese. At the end of the game victory points are determined and the Japanese points are subtracted from the US points and compared to a table to determine the victory level. The game is advanced level and the playing time is 3 to 10 hours.</desc>

		<name>Castle Wolfenstein</name>
		<desc>In this game, the player takes control of a lone prisoner who has been taking captive in a large castle occupied by the Nazis. Getting out of the cell and picking up a weapon is just the beginning; the ultimate goal is to acquire the war plans of the Nazis, and escape from Castle Wolfenstein alive.

Castle Wolfenstein is notable for being the first game that incorporated stealth-based gameplay mechanics. The player navigates the hero through the top-down corridors and rooms of the castle. The main gameplay challenge lies in dealing with the guards who patrol the castle and will be alerted to any noise made by the player. It is possible to shoot the guards, but the ammunition in the game is scarce, and some guards are very hard to kill, so the preferred course of action is moving without being noticed. If the player surprises a guard with a gun drawn, the guard will surrender, and the player will be able to frisk him for valuable items.

The player should also search the treasure chests scattered across the castle. Some of them contain war plans, which are essential for winning the game; others have useful items, such as bullets, grenades, bulletproof vests, and guard uniforms. The uniforms can be worn for disguise; however, higher-ranked SS guards will be able to recognize the intruder. Chests might also contain food and beverage; imbibing alcohol will result in a temporary loss of aim and balance for the player character.

The game's sound effects include some of the earliest examples of digital voice samples. The guards would sometimes shout out short phrases in German in an attempt to stop the protagonist.</desc>

		<desc>You are an astronaut on the moon of Callisto and mutants have stolen the panels from your spaceship along with its ion drive. You must explore the caverns of Callisto, recover all the panels, find the ion drive and escape alive.

This is a fast paced arcade shooter, in which you fly on your jet-pack through the maze-like caverns, avoiding all the aliens and attempting to find your missing ship parts. Your jet-pack has a limited amount of fuel which must also be collected on your way around. You are equipped with a unlimited ammo gun which kills all aliens in one hit, but this overheats if used too much, leaving you temporarily defenceless. 

The game is divided into 5 sections each of which contains 8 missing panels, and either a key to get to the next level or the missing ion drive.</desc>

		<name>Chivalry</name>
		<desc>Chivalry is a medieval-themed computer board game where players must rescue the King from the dreaded Black Knight.

The game is set up as a standard board game for up to four players.  Each player must take turns and roll the dice or spin the wheel to move the player in that set number of spaces.  

There are 35 spaces with over 40 challenges in total where each player must take part in a arcade-style mini-game challenge or make a decision based on the choices given.  The tasks range from catching flour bags in a cart, finding the secret to evading a troll, or choosing the correct door to enter from a Wizard.  Players are also given the option to take the high road or the low road in their travels, which also determines the challenges found.

Depending on when players land on a space, random elements can affect the outcome, some helpful, others harmful.  Winning the challenge determines whether the player will proceed further along the board.  Losing a challenge can set a player back or lose a turn.

The game is won when the player successfully beats the Black Knight by climbing the tower and saving the King.</desc>

		<name>Close Assault</name>
		<desc>From a time when the best graphics a computer game offered were on the front cover of the box, Avalon Hill's Close Assault offers a hybrid computer/board game experience by enclosing cardboard counters and a playing board. The result, per the manual, is a "visual impact... much greater than on even the best of computer graphics displays" while freeing for the processor, "a huge amount of limited resources" normally used to manage the graphical interface. Those resources instead are devoted to accounting for every soldier engaged in the scenario, and fulfilling a dream of the era's simulation board-gamers: realism in what you know and when you know it. In Close Assault, your opponent's units appear on the board only when they are spotted by yours, their morale is only evident by their behavior, and only your experience will tell you the odds of success. This is a far cry from the usual board simulation experience, where you could pour over combat success tables and footnoted modifiers to judge exactly where the chances break in your favor, and use the morale markers on your opponent's front line to decide where to push.

Close Assault's combination of three scenarios and three forces allows representation of a dozen different historical situations spanning northern Europe in World War II. Squad-level tactics are simulated on a common map showing a small village and three levels of topography. Commands are entered numerically or as single letters in response to computer prompts, as each player proceeds through six phases of hotseat turns -- units moving, firing, and reacting -- which represent two minutes of battle. As the computer kicks out the results of your gambles and guesses, counters come and go on the map, squads being spotted and routed or destroyed. In that way, the game is a genuine hybrid, flicking players' attention back and forth between the cardboard map and the computer screen. Units also come and go from your command: when they become demoralized or enter close combat, the computer takes over. Meanwhile, the manual comes straight out of the board-game simulation tradition, outlined by topic and case with occasional lessons in history and battle science, such as (regarding morale), "beneath the surface of any organized army lies a terrified mass of men who long for home and peace".

The game experience would be limited to the standard armchair-lieutenant's view, but for a simple number noted on the squad record pad (an analog device to help the humans remember casualties, equipment, experience, and leader placement). The number represents you on the battlefield. Somehow, this simple mechanism effectively engrosses players in the course of the battle. If you become a casualty, the computer finishes the scenario for you while you watch, possibly even carrying your soldiers to victory if you left your sergeants well-positioned.

Besides two-player hot-seat, solitaire is available, wherein the programmers put the computer's capable calculations to work on multi-turn tactics, nuanced with the historical characteristics of the opposing nationalities, from equipment to morale to battle tactics.</desc>

		<desc>Colonial Conquest is a grand strategy game set during the late 1800's and early 1900's that puts you in charge of one of the six Imperialistic powers of the time (Great Britain, France, Germany, U.S., Russia and Japan). Using diplomacy, espionage, armies and fleets, these six countries vie for control of more than 120 minor countries and each other. Your goal in the game is to conquer as many minor nations as possible and set yourself up as the mightiest ruler on Earth. There are three scenarios, and up to six people can play each as a separate nation - or the computer can take charge of all the other nations.</desc>

		<path>./Computer Baseball (1981)(SSI).dsk</path>
		<name>Computer Baseball</name>
		<desc>Computer Baseball is a game of both strategy and statistics. Managers manipulate pinch hitters, infield positions, relief pitchers and base runners. 28 major league teams are provided to choose from and data for new teams can be entered as well.

Starting the game, you have four options to choose from: playing a game against the computer, playing a two player game, entering data for a new team and reviewing or editing data in an existing team data file. The display screen will consist of a scoreboard, batter and pitcher status information, and a representation of the playing field. The bottom of the screen is used for inputs on actions being taken.

There are seven different defense actions to choose from: setting the infield position, setting the outfield position, how close to hold base runners, making pitching changes, making a defensive substitution, saving the current game status and how to pitch to the batter. Some of the defensive actions taken will branch out to further options to select. There are three different offense actions to choose from: selecting a base running strategy, putting in a pinch hitter and choosing how you want the batter to hit the ball. Selecting any three of the offense actions will branch out to further options to select. 

Player injuries are possible during game play, which the computer will specify while also determining how long the player will be injured (in days). It is also possible for a player to be ejected from the game for arguing with the umpire. On the event of a player being injured or ejected, the computer will ask for a substitute player. If a pitcher throws too many innings in one game, he will begin to tire, and another pitcher must be warmed up.  Bringing in a pitcher who isn't warmed up in the bullpen properly will reduce his effectiveness.

Before the game begins, you can stipulate which players and pitchers on each roster are unavailable for that game.

There is no functionality to save statistics or game results.</desc>

		<desc>Conglomerates Collide is a game of multinational corporation management. Or basically, a monopoly sim. You take the role a high-ranking executive in charge of company acquisitions and your objective is to acquire the most companies in the market in order to propel you to the role of chairman of the board and defeat the opposing corporations.

You start the game with a base capital of 20 million dollars and through each turn you must decide whether to swallow companies or not depending on their current worth, which is determined by the ever changing market conditions. The trick is that you are not alone in the game as other corporations are on the hunt to acquire successful companies and it's your job to grow enough each year/turn so that you can take the poor workers away from the other corporations and ingest them into your own money-making monsters instead of the other way around. Remember! This is a game of multinational conglomerates so the bigger and badder the better.

Features 3 modes of play: single player, vs computer and vs human opponents (up to 4-players hot-seat). Uses a simple text-based interface with small still graphics to commemorate events such as acquisitions and such.</desc>

		<name>Conquest</name>
		<desc>Conquest is a variant of Joust. 

The player starts with four lives and controls a giant bird (bigger than in Joust) in the prehistoric age to battle pterodactyl warriors. The giant bird has the ability to run and to fly by constantly flapping its wings. Defeating pterodactyls is done by slamming into the pterodactyls (which bears no visual resemblance to actual pterodactyls) from a higher altitude; a lower altitude will result in death, while vertical altitude will result in the player and the pterodactyl bouncing off each other. Successfully slamming from a higher altitude will turn the pterodactyls into eggs, which may bounce away, as well as award the player with points. Additional points may be gathered by collecting these eggs.

The game is divided into different rounds which will introduce more challenges: additional pterodactyls, which will spawn at any one of the eight green spawning areas; the lower ground will disappear and introduce wind current affecting the gravitational velocity of all moving objects in the game; the default six platforms may also change into fewer platforms; and an indestructible dragon may occasionally appear, resulting in instant death when collided with.</desc>

		<name>Countdown to Shutdown</name>
		<desc>In Countdown to Shutdown, also known as Countdown to Meltdown, you control eight droids on the mission to find the core room of an nuclear power plant, in which a serious explosion has caused large casualties.

The game is an arcade-like 3D adventure, you see always only the room your droid moves in, in the bottom of the screen you receive information like actual core temp and radiation level, time remaining, the direction you heading for, information about your shield level and others . Once you found the core room you must attempt to damp down the reactor temperature to avoid a major catastrophe a second explosion will cause.

With the joystick you control all 8 droids, you have to switch several times between them because of the fact, that each of them has a special ability (like scientific, medical, technical, combat, intelligence, power, strength and mobility). Over 2.000 rooms on 8 levels waiting for you. Examine all rooms (press "E" on your keyboard) for useful and often required items and valuables (like weapons, medical or technical tool sets) - each of your droids is able to keep 8 items in his inventory. Beware of radiation (the closer you get to the core room, the more it increases, before entering the core room you need to find and activate radiation shields), defense droids  which were installed to keep out intruders (like you!) and Plasma. Because of the first explosion some doors between rooms were blocked or damaged: Find the needed technical tool sets for example to fix such issues.

Once you have found the core room, use the abilities of your different droids and the - hopefully found - correct tools to damp down the temperature and stop the disaster.</desc>

		<desc>Cricketeer is a Frogger variant where the player takes control of a cricket that like in the arcade original first has to cross a heavily trafficked street and then a river before jumping into one of five home boxes on the far end of the river. Unlike the arcade game the street and river sections take place on separate screens.  A level is completed when all five home boxes are occupied by crickets and the game then moves on to a higher level. Lives are lost after being hit by a vehicle or jumping into the river and when they are all gone the game is over.</desc>

		<desc>Crime and Punishment is a courtroom simulation, where you play the judge. The emphasis lies on deciding the punishment, rather than if the person is guilty or not - that has already been decided. The aim is to receive as many Gavels as possible (out of ten), by choosing the same sentence as a judge.

Cases range from perjury and theft right up to murder and rape. To help you make your decision, you can receive information about the crime. This includes the damage caused by the crime, the villain's background and personal circumstances, and his/her motive.

Be aware that the more information you ask for, the less gavels you receive. The AI can sometimes produce surprising choices of sentences.</desc>

		<desc>In this adaptation of the arcade game Targ your job is to defend your city from marauding alien beasts. You can simultaneously maneuver your craft and shoot in four directions while patrolling the regular grid of streets - the enemy has surrounded your city block, and attacks are coming in from all sides as the aliens swarm in with all guns blazing. To survive, you'll have to blast your way out by darting in and out of the line of fire and taking down the assailants with your own volleys: once they're all eliminated, you go forth to the next level, to face yet another wave.

Ammunition is limited, and from time to time you'll have to restock by picking up a fresh supply.  Every level contains four bonus crystals: as time goes by, they emerge one-by-one to be picked up, and each is worth twice as much as the last.  The game starts you off with three ships, though you get a fresh one for every 5000 points you score.</desc>

		<name>Crypt of Medea Save Disk</name>
		<desc>Based loosely on the famed Greek character, Crypt of Medea is one of the earliest horror-themed games released for the Apple II series. The plot is simple: you are trapped in an underground crypt filled with a variety of ghastly creatures and traps, and you must find your way out before you become just another nameless corpse--just like the ones you encounter all throughout the maze-like mausoleum.

Crypt of Medea is a Hi-Res adventure game with color graphics, using the simple two-word "verb noun" parser that was common in these types of games. In its heyday, it was panned for its graphic depictions of gratuitous violence, but seeing as such material has almost become a standard in today's games, one could argue that Crypt of Medea was fairly ahead of its time.</desc>

		<path>./Cytron Masters (19xx)(SSI)[b].dsk</path>
		<name>Cytron Masters</name>
		<desc>The first real-time strategy game in history, Cytron Masters was the creation of legendary designer
Dan Bunten (later Danielle Bunten Berry). In this game, the contestants face off on a futuristic battlefield. The object is to destroy the opponent's command center. The game can be played with two players, or one player competing against the computer.

CYTRONS (short for CYbernetic elecTRONic units) come in five types:  Mines, Shooters, Bunkers, Commanders, and Missiles. Shooters are constantly scanning for enemy units in their three space range. They will fire at the closest target. The Commander unit can relay orders from you to all Cytrons within three spaces of its location. Missiles soar above the battlefield. When detonated over an appropriate target, Missiles can destroy up to four Cytrons at once.

The battlefield is a 2-D grid. One contestant starts on each side. The main features on either end of the field are the Command Centers. The goal of each manager is the destruction of the opponent's Command Center. The players can use energy to create more Cytron units during the battle. The battlefield has eight Power Centers, and by occupying a Power Center a player will accumulate more energy.

Ahead of its time in many ways, Cytron Masters used multi-thread software routines to enable all the units to move in real-time. It also included an interactive tutorial. Dan Bunten went on to expand his ideas from this game in his later work Modem Wars, published in 1988.</desc>

		<desc>A strategy/war game where you must defeat your opponents and take over their territories.  You select one of four territories to play as and up to 6 players can play.  The 'Gruds' play the remaining teams.  The game takes place on an overhead map of the land, with each country's territories color-coded.  Each turn you get more men, move them from territory to territory, and fight to take over new territories.  The goal is of course to defeat all your opponents and the Gruds, and own the entire land.</desc>

		<name>Death in the Caribbean</name>
		<desc>Death in the Caribbean is an old-style text/graphics adventure. You are an treasure hunter on an unnamed Caribbean island searching for buried pirate gold. You'll travel through numerous locales, a tricky maze, and past fierce alligators on your way to the chest of Doubloons. Puzzles range from "find object and apply to situation" to a doozy of a cryptogram.

As for mechanics, the graphic section of the screen draws itself in visible pen elements (i.e.: Outline then fill, move on to next shape). Below the graphics window is a simple command line with a tiny bit of room above for the brief written description of the area you are in. Like every good adventure game, the puzzles start easy and get more difficult as you progress, until they get just plain silly hard. Play time is about 30 hours. It comes on 4 disk sides, the front and back of two floppy disks. This game does not innovate upon the genre, and is built on the gameplay of its predecessors.</desc>

You hop into a turbo-car, and must navigate the 2 miles of twisting concrete jungle that surrounds the castle in every direction. Hiding out are robotic Death Squad cars armed with laserquark cannons, which will attempt to hunt down the player, and destroy them. The robotic lasers are so powerful, they can slice through solid walls to destroy the player.</desc>

		<name>Deathlord</name>
		<desc>An Ultima style RPG with an oriental flavor.  The Deathlord and his army of demons are destroying the land and Emperor Nakamoto has called upon you and your party to fight back and defeat him.  There are 8 races and 16 classes to choose from along with a handy translation guide that tells you a Genkai is really a Wizard and a Ryoshi is a specialized Fighter.  The 84 spells also have Japanese names but their effects will be familiar to any fan of European style medieval adventures.  In fact, Deathlord even includes a utility to import and Easternize your characters from Bard?s Tale, Ultima III, and Wizardry.

One other thing to note is that Deathlord is quite large.  The quest itself takes place on over a dozen continents each with multiple cities and dungeons.  According to the estimate on the package, it is designed to fill ?a few hundred hours? of the player?s time.</desc>

The submarines will release various mines which head to the surface but you are armed with five depthcharges which move down the screen trying to hit the submarines or mines. If you hit a submarine, mine or the depthcharge hits the bottom of the screen then you are re-armed with another one. If you are hit by a mine then that ship is lost and the next ship appears.

		<desc>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. (if you start to inflate them but stop doing so, the monsters will get turned back to their normal selves). Furthermore, rocks are scattered throughout the earth, and you can use these rocks to squash them. If the monsters do not find you for several seconds, they will eventually get turned into ghosts, which are able to walk through the earth. They are invincible and cannot be killed. From time to time, vegetables will appear in the center, and you can get these for points.</desc>

How you complete the task is largely up to you. You will need to deal with the plane's instruments, to take off, and plan which areas of the sky you patrol in the search for the Bismarck. There are four distinct instrument panels to control engineer, navigator and gunner functions as well as the main flight controls. Statistics on how much of each enemy's fleet you destroy are kept.</desc>

		<name>Donkey Kong</name>
		<desc>Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally "Jumpman") and Donkey Kong.

Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out. Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited. From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.

Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights. Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time. Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.

Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story. It should also be noted that in many conversions of the original coin-op game for early 1980's consoles and computer-systems, Donkey Kong only used two or three of the original levels, with the cement factory most often omitted.</desc>

The levels consist of rows of platforms, with gaps which can be jumped through to go up or down a vertical level. The creatures to avoid and shoot vary from strange hopping, beer-belly aliens, to demons, snakes, and axes flying through the air (we never do find out who's throwing those axes!).

Like Defender, Drol incorporates a "radar"  at the top of the screen, so you can find the children and dodge incoming baddies.</desc>

		<desc>Sneak through unique maze after maze gobbling white dots while being hunted by the Mega-Bugs.  Their job is made easier because The Mouth you pilot leaves behind a trail of colored dots which they will follow relentlessly the moment they come upon it. This makes the maze's dead-ends truly treacherous.  Your job is made harder by the size of the maze (20x20), which requires a magnifier over your location to show the action, effectively creating a blind spot at a radius of three dots around you.  To succeed, you must watch not only where you're going, but scan each randomly generated maze to plan your route and avoid the Mega-Bugs.  If you do succeed, you're rewarded with a new maze and an additional Mega-Bug hunting you.  If you fail, the bugs dance gleefully and shout, "we gotcha!"

This ROM cartridge game was clearly inspired, but not limited, by Pac-Man.</desc>

		<path>./Eagles (1983)(SSI).dsk</path>
		<name>Eagles</name>
		<desc>Eagles is a game that simulates the dogfights and melees that occurred in the skies over France and Germany in the latter half of WWI. There are three scenarios to choose from at the start of game: Over There, Voss's Last Fight and Red And Black. In addition, there are four different mini-games to choose from: Bloody April, Sausage Run, Contact Patrol and The Eleventh Hour. 

During game play, you will face many of the situations that the period's pilots had to face. A dogfight in Eagles can involve as many as twenty planes. Each aircraft will have an ID number on them running from 1-20. 1-10 are always the Allied aircraft and 11-20 are the Germans. Play proceeds in rounds from the lowest number aircraft going first and continuing all the way up to the highest number aircraft doing the last move. Play continues in this fashion until all planes have been shot down or returned to base. The play field is defined in squares running north, south, east and west. Each square represents an area roughly 50 yards on a side. There is also a third dimension of squares, which is altitude. Each level of altitude is 25 feet high. Pilots can see targets four squares out and can fire their weapons one square out. Weather conditions, like clouds and wind, will also play a factor in game play.

At the end of each game, scores show how many kills were made, the time frame for completing each mission and ranks. Ranks are determined on successful missions you have completed. There is also an optional section for creating your own planes at the beginning of the game.</desc>

		<path>./Elite (1985)(David Braben - I. Bell)[cr].dsk</path>
		<name>Elite</name>
		<desc>Elite is a free-form space trading and combat simulation, commonly considered the progenitor of this sub-genre. The player initially controls a character referred to as "Commander Jameson", starting at Lave Station with 100 credits and a lightly armed trading ship called Cobra Mark III. Most of the game consists of traveling to various star systems, trading with their inhabitants, gaining money and reputation. Money can also be gained by other means beside trading; these include undertaking military missions, bounty hunting, asteroid mining, and even piracy. As the player character earns money, he becomes able to upgrade his ships with enhancements such as better weapons, shields, increased cargo capacity, an automated docking system, etc.

The game utilizes pseudo-3D wire-frame graphics; its world is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has no overarching story, though a race known as Thargoids play the role of antagonists: their ships will often attack the player-controlled ship, forcing the player to engage in space combat. Combat is action-oriented, taking place in the same environment as the exploration. The player must use various weapons the ship is equipped with, as well as manoeuvre the ship, trying to dodge enemy attacks. The player can also choose to attack neutral ships; doing so will decrease the protagonist's reputation, eventually attracting the attention of the galactic police.

Elite is notable for its expansive game world, consisting of eight galaxies and 256 planets. The player is free to travel to any of these planets, provided his ship has enough fuel for the trip (the ship's fuel capacity is limited for a journey to the distance of seven light years).</desc>

		<desc>The gateway to the New York Rocket Field is your first step of a space voyage in which you may choose one of three career paths to follow, here at the dawn of the interstellar Empire.  Homesteaders must find a hospital planet on which to farm, raise a family and conquer the environment.  Miners must find a high-density planet in a search for material wealth.  Missionaries seek out populated planets to preach to the masses.  Each path into the space frontier has its dangers, and a misstep may have bloody consequences.</desc>

		<name>Empire of the Over-Mind</name>
		<desc>In starting Empire of the Over-Mind within a few short steps you are on a forest path with a red planet overhead, relishing the choice between a mountain trail and a cave. Adventure stretches out before you, forty characters of text per line, or maybe sixty.  As in all text adventures, that particular stretch of forest path in Empire of the Over-Mind may become over-familiar before you get yourself to the right place with the right items to travel finally to the red planet. 

Empire of the Over-Mind departs from typical text adventures, though, in its movement. Cardinal directions are not used. Instead, one references the avenue of movement: the road, door, or even cliff-face which leads to the next location. Also unusual is the ability to look ahead -- e.g. down the road -- and see what is there before moving. The objects you see ahead can vary from game to game: sometimes the key glints enticingly while the skeleton hides in the shadows, other times you can only see the key if you bravely confront the skeleton. Menacing though the perils are, your mistakes are gently handled: even the crocodile only "clobbers" you.

Typical of the era, the parser handles two-word verb-object combinations, or three words if an adjective is needed. Depending on the platform, item locations can vary from start to start, and getting clobbered means you have to hunt them all down again. Necessary clues are hidden in a long, printed poem which comes with the game. Avalon Hill's instructions are a fascinating artifact themselves. Besides the profoundly basic level -- covering the "prompt character," the back-space key, and the exigencies of programming in 48K or less -- a memory map is offered. No simple "Save" command or hotkey here: a little assembly language saves the game state.</desc>

		<name>Enchanter</name>
		<desc>You are a dim ignorant Apprentice Enchanter, but your task is enormous.  You must save the world from the warlock Krill who is ruling the land with his evil powers. You are not the first in this quest but hopefully you will be the first to succeed, as the more experienced members of the Circle of Enchanters are powerless. You know  the basics of magic and will have the chance to learn many spells. Keep your wits and use everything you can to your benefit!

Enchanter is a text adventure set in the Zork universe, following the original Zork trilogy. As in the previous games, the player interacts with the environment by typing in text commands, usually combinations of verbs and objects. A new feature in the game is the player character's ability to cast spells. These spells must be memorized before the protagonist is able to cast them, and are learned during the course of the game. The text parser understands the names of the spells as verbs, and the player only needs to type in the spell name and the name of an object he/she wishes to cast that particular spell on.</desc>

		<desc>It's 1989, and there's good news and bad news. The good news: there's a spectacular meteor shower scheduled to light up the sky. The bad news: the meteoroids are bearing a rather deadly, virulent disease -- when they impact our planet, things might get ugly. It's up to you to contain the infection, and prevent mankind from getting its own museum display case, next to the dinosaurs.

Your stint as head of the Global Disease Control Center lasts from 15 to 30 game turns (depending on the chosen skill level). One turn represents a day, and allows a limited number of actions: you'll be able to monitor approaching meteorites on the radar, target them with missiles before they hit, and enact emergency measures throughout the Earth's fourteen regions to curb the spread of the contagion. Disease statistics are updated on the world map on each turn, and various remedies can be deployed, ranging from vaccination, irradiation and body suits to genetic engineering, firestorms, and that perennial last resort... the nuke.</desc>

Your mission is to find the exit of the maze. On your way to the exit you will encounter many obstacles, like bombs, magic traps, teleporters, locked doors and an infinite supply of monsters. Many things in the maze will also aid you in your quest such as bandages, first aid kits, potions, scrolls, money, weapons, rings, belts, wands, and armor. Your inventory may contain up to eight items. 

When you start the game you have no health points so it is very easy to get killed right in the beginning. Your maximum health will increase every time you kill a monster.</desc>

The first level is the amoeba stage where you need to eat all the DNA on the screen while avoiding the spores, microbes, and antibodies that are trying to stop you. The second level is the tadpole stage. The tadpole needs to eat three flies to move on to the next stage while avoiding the very hungry fish. Next is the rodent stage, where you need to eat five blocks of cheese while avoiding the snakes. In level four you need to guide a beaver across alligator infested waters to retrieve sticks and build a dam. The fifth level is the gorilla stage, where your gorilla has to use coconuts to fight off monkeys that are trying to steel its orange stash. And finally is the human stage, where you have to use a laser gun to fight off mutants that are trying to take over the earth.</desc>

		<desc>Fastgammon is a computer adaptation of the board game Backgammon. The game follows the rules of the board game as can be expected with one player competing against an AI opponent, both attempting to move all their pieces of the board. It's entirely played with keyboard and to do a move the player simply enters the number of the starting point followed with the number of the destination. To move a piece of the bar the player enters B followed by the number of the destination point. To bear off a piece the player enters the number of the point followed by an H. Dice rolls are done automatically by the program (except for the Atari version where it's possible to turn on manual input of dice values). When starting a new game it's possible to reuse the dice rolls from the previous game.</desc>

		<name>Fat City</name>
		<desc>If you've ever dreamed of being in control of a wrecking ball, with blocks and blocks of defenseless buildings at your mercy, Fat City is your chance.  You're placed in charge of the massive multi-ton instrument of metallic destruction, and get a first-person view of the proceedings as you gleefully unleash devastation on everything in your path.

The playfield scrolls in four directions, and you proceed from city to city by mowing down every structure on the block (without running out of fuel).  Evidently there's some resistance to the demolition plans, and various flying objects aimed at your vehicle attempt to convey the message.  These will shorten your career if they hit, but can be deflected with a carefully-aimed swing of your wrecking ball.  Fortunately, you can fill up your tank by finding fuel depots, so that the satisfying *crunch* of crumbling masonry may go on a while longer.</desc>

		<name>Fifty Mission Crush</name>
		<desc>50 Mission Crush is a simulation game that puts you into the cockpit of a B-17 Flying Fortress bomber during WWII. 

You are part of the 8th Air Force 306th Bomber Group and you must try to survive 50 missions (in real life the average lifespan of a crew member was 18.33 missions) in your B-17 (named the Impatient Virgin) over France and Germany. As pilot you will have full control of your bomber and 10 crew members, each of which plays a different role in your mission. 

After each mission providing you have survived you will be evaluated and awarded points based on mission difficulty, bombing accuracy and aircraft destroyed. The more points you receive the closer you get to being promoted. You start off as a Lieutenant and can make it all the way to Brigadier general. Also depending on how many points you earn in a mission you can receive a medal or if you are wounded a Purple Heart. Each mission lasts approximately 10 minutes.

The '50 Mission Crush' was the name given to the crushed service cap of the battle hardened veterans who flew the B-17 during WWII. It was a mark of distinction and honor.</desc>

You must keep some on guard duties, balancing this against how many you send off to attack other territories, in which case you must wait and see the outcome. You get more men as the game goes on, ultimately increasing the status of your bases, and this isn?t dependent on how many are kept back, unlike Megalomania?s breeding effect.</desc>

Encounters are played out in text, but there is a map screen which gives an overview of the landscape. One must raise enough gold to hire wizards, warriors, scouts, clerics and raiders by defeating bands of roaming monsters and minions. In addition, a number of artifacts and special items must be found before entering the fortress. Up to four players compete in hot-seat play.</desc>

		<desc>Your task in this arcade game is to guide a frog across a treacherous road and river, and to safety at the top of the screen. Both these sections are fraught with a variety of hazards, each of which will kill the frog and cost you a life if contact is made.

The road is full of cars and trucks, at variable speeds. The river water itself is fatal, as are the snakes which hover within on later levels. Frogger must use the arrangement of logs, turtles (which are only there for a short time) and alligators (but stay away from their faces), and then jump into one of the open home-cells, ideally one containing a fly for extra points. Once all holes have been filled, you move onto the next, harder, level.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, players have to launch a spaceship from a vessel that moves left and right repeatedly until the fire button is pressed. After the ship is released, it must be guided through a field of orbs (that also move left and right) to one of the four pads at the bottom of the screen. While avoiding the orbs, the ship can be slowed down by releasing fuel so it makes navigating to the pads easier. The pads each consist of three layers, and a layer is removed when the player's ship lands on it and a small blue alien enters it. Once done, the player needs to guide the alien back to the vessel. The invaders will get released from the orbs, but the player can shoot them with a bullet.</desc>

		<path>./Galactic Revolution (1980)(Broderbund).dsk</path>
		<name>Galactic Saga - Galactic Revolution</name>
		<desc>Galactic Revolution  is the sequel to Galactic Empire and Galactic Trader and the third game in the Galactic Saga.

The Central Galactic System is united under the rule of the emperor Tawala Mundo, but there's trouble brewing. Tawala's violent temper has cost many of his subjects their life. The military's support for the empire dwindles due to the popularity of the former fleet commander (and protagonist of the previous games), Julian du Buque. A growing bureaucracy makes times hard for trade and sees the rise of Jan Swart, leader of the Broederbund, a secret guild of traders. These three men now compete for influence and power in the galaxy, for a revolution is at hand.

Galactic Revolution is a strategy game of political maneuvering and can be played by up to three players. A single player always plays du Buque; in two-player games the second player plays Tawala. Any remaining factions are controlled by the computer. The goal of the game is to control all 18 planets in the empire.

Control over a planet is won through support of five power groups: manufacturers, military, peasants, traders, and bureaucrats. On each planet, a player's goal should be to increase the relative influence of those groups favorable to them while at the same time decreasing the influence of those favorable to the other factions. After a player travels to the planet in question, this is done through so-called "administrative action". For example, instituting a general draft increases the influence of the military but decreases the influence of the peasants and traders, since they get drafted. Other options are land reforms, lowering or increasing trade tariffs or taxes, reducing bureaucracy, and more. Besides the immediate effect on the power distribution on the planet, these actions also influence the galaxy-wide standings of the player to each faction. A planet falls to a player when a certain threshold of support is crossed, figuring in both local and galaxy-wide sympathies. At the end of each turn, planets under a player's control can be utilized to collect taxes, build ships and weapons and draft troops. These are necessary to build up one's legions: one legion requires one unit of arms, one ship and 10 troops. 

Taking administrative action is only possible on independent worlds or worlds not controlled by another player. While it is possible to take control by political maneuvering, there is also the military option. Winning the battle for a planet not only allows the victor to take local administrative action (temporarily), but also increases support from all power groups in the galaxy. On the other hand, losing a battle decreases support across the board. A planet's defender may choose to order a tactical retreat, in which case a loss has no influence on the power groups.

Another option involving the military (which is not available in the single-player game) is the blockade. A blockaded planet cannot be used by its owner for collecting taxes, drafting or construction. The blockade must be broken by sending the same number of legions used to establish it, but troops used to make or break a blockade are always lost.

Another political option is the alliance (not available in the single-player game). Allied players share their resource pool of ships, troops and arms, allowing for the forming of larger numbers of legions in the case of an uneven distribution of resources.

Each faction begins the game with different starting conditions, requiring different strategies for play. Du Buque, for example, controls only one planet at the beginning, has strong support with the military and medium support with the traders, and has a large number of troops, but only relatively few ships, at his disposal. Tawala controls the most planets, has strong support of the bureaucrats but lousy support of the traders, very little money, lots of arms, but only a handful of ships. Swart has the most money and ships, but the fewest troops, and his support among both the peasants and the bureaucrats is low.</desc>

		<path>./Galactic Trader (1980)(Broderbund).dsk</path>
		<name>Galactic Saga - Galactic Trader</name>
		<desc>Galactic Trader is the sequel to Galactic Empire and the second game in the Galactic Saga. The planet Galactica's forces have conquered the Central Galactic System, but with the new empire now established and at peace, the fleet commander responsible for the campaign finds himself without a job. Left with only a small personal ship, some fuel and a few credits, a career change from conqueror to trader is in order.

The goal in the game is to amass the number of one billion credits within 1000 years. Profits are made by transferring cargo from one planet to another - the farther away a commodity is sold from its source, the more profit is to be made. Keeping with the absence of faster-than-light travel or communication established in Galactic Empire, it is impossible to know what a commodity goes for on a certain planet unless it is visited. While the ship computer keeps track of prices, these might be out of date when a planet is revisited. The prices follow a dynamic economic model of supply and demand. Finding a good trade route might invite to reusing it again and again, but there's a catch: if a big consortium gets wind of a profitable route, they can lay an exclusive claim to it, shutting it off from further use by the player.

Flying around from planet to planet isn't free: an eye must always be kept on fuel consumption, which depends on distance traveled and the mass of the carried cargo. To avoid being lost in space when it runs out, fuel must be bought from the fuel cartel. They accept credits, but when cash flow is low, cargo can be traded in for fuel as well, but usually at less attractive rates. Bartering is also necessary on most planets, since only on Galactica cargo can be converted to credits. The game goal thus necessitates visits to Galactica from time to time, but this harbors another risk: the new emperor, jealous of the former fleet commander's popularity, might attempt to assassinate him. Each visit to Galactica increases the chance of an untimely death.

The game interface is for the most part unchanged from Galactic Empire, but adapted to the new gameplay. The ship's console displays an image of the current locale, the current stardate, and statistics about cargo, cash and fuel. The ship's computer can be accessed to display the galactic map, give information about trading rates at planets already visited and calculate the fuel needed to reach the next destination.</desc>

		<desc>GATO is a real-time 3D submarine simulation game, where the player is a commander of a United States submarine in the Pacific Ocean during World War II against Japanese warships. Gameplay consists of missions where the primary directive is to navigate the submarine to track and intercept (multiple) enemy warships (patrol boats, destroyers, etc.) on the randomly created map (which consists of randomly placed islands) and close in for the kill with torpedoes.

Combat itself consists of a direct visual of enemy ships (via periscope) and firing torpedoes at the correct angle to ultimately sink the ship. Be warned that although the player has the element of surprise of a submerged vessel, enemy ships will return fire. When all hell breaks loose, a disclosed submarine is a sitting duck to Japanese guns. Be prepared to direct the damage control team to fix up the damaged submarine when under fire. The mission ends when the player has successfully eliminated all targets on the map.</desc>

		<name>Ghostbusters</name>
		<desc>Based on the 1984 film of the same name, the Ghostbusters are the ones to call to "bust" any ghost hauntings. They do this through the use of nuclear-accelerated "proton packs" and "ghost traps", whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility at their Headquarters. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly and dramatically increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal psychokinetic energy, the "PK level" in the city, which represents ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and resurrects an evil goddess called Gozer.

Ghostbusters is an action game that features an overhead-view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor a map of midtown Manhattan for "ghost alarms", as well as for casual, roaming spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. Once the route is plotted, the player then controls the purchased Ghostmobile as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. When the haunted location is reached, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the Ghostbusters will take position, activate their proton beams, and toss a trap to the ground. The player must then use the two Ghostbusters to attempt to lead the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap springs to capture any ghosts directly above it. A successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for it. An unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away (after nastily sliming one of the Ghostbusters).

As the game progresses, the PK energy in the city increases. The Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly successful at busting ghosts. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.</desc>

		<desc>Gobbler is a Pac-Man clone that is mostly identical to the original arcade game. The maze layout is slightly different but otherwise it offers the same gameplay. The gobbler has to clear the maze of all dots while avoiding the ghosts that chase him. Picking up a large dot energizes the gobbler for ten seconds, allowing him to go after the ghosts. Dots are worth five points, ghosts are worth 200-800 points and fruit is worth 200 points. The gobbler has three lives. The game can be played with either keyboard or joystick.</desc>

		<name>Gremlins</name>
		<desc>Gremlins is an action game based on the Steven Spielberg movie of the same name. The game takes place just after midnight when there are Gremlins and Mogwai running around Billy's living room!

You control Billy from a 3rd person point of view. On each level, your goal is to catch all of the Mogwai and return them to their cage (located in the upper right corner of the screen) and to destroy all of the Gremlins with a sword. Each level has a time limit - at 6:00 am when the sun rises. You move on to the next level by completing your tasks or just surviving until 6:00, although more points are awarded for the former. You will also receive bonus points for each Mogwai returned to the cage. 

On many of the levels there will be various types of food lying about the screen. If a Mogwai eats any food, it will turn into a gremlin. There may also be  puddles of water; if a Gremlin or Mogwai runs into the water, it will split into two. Some levels also contain a refrigerator or popcorn machine which will throw food out onto the screen, or a television which will distract the Gremlins. 

You also begin the game with a limited number of flash cubes; if you get into trouble, you can use these to temporarily stun all of the Gremlins and Mogwai. As the levels progress gameplay becomes faster and the Gremlins and Mogwai more numerous.</desc>

		<name>Guadalcanal Campaign</name>
		<desc>Guadalcanal Campaign is a turn-based wargame simulating the 1942 Battle of Guadalcanal during the Second World War. It lets the player command American land, sea, and air forces between August 7 and December 31, pitting them against the Japanese (controlled by second player or the computer). Alternatively, a short campaign (October 1 - December 31) and short scenarios (Coral Sea, Eastern Solomons, Santa Cruz) are also available.


Each game turn represents 12 hours (the full campaign lasting 147 days, 2 turns per day). A game turn consists of reinforcing your troops, moving task forces (numerous ships are included, from destroyers to aircraft carriers) and troops into position, launching air missions and patrols (each side has one fighter type and four bomber types, plus recon floatplanes) and combat resolution. The map is a 40x40 grid stretching from Truk to northern Australia shore, with key ports and airbases. Victory points are computed at the end of each game.</desc>

Gumballs of different color are expelled from the machine in the top left corner, and they work their way through a series of complex devices to eventually be deposited from various slots at the bottom of the machine. The player controls the motion of various levers within the machine to control the pathway of the different colored gumballs. The player must then also move the colored carts at the bottom of the screen so that the correct colored gumball is deposited in each cart.</desc>

You're starting into the adventure as a real hacker would do, lacking information of what is to come, only driven by your ambition. Consequently, the game opens with a plain text screen, prompting you for the login password. To break into the system is the first puzzle you've got to solve.

Once in, you'll soon find out that you've accidentally stumbled upon a conspiracy of global impact. From then on, you'll maneuver a robotic drone around the globe through a tunnel system deep in the earth. In major cities, you may surface and talk to contact persons, who'll trade items for cash. When delivered to the correct city, you can exchange these items for a piece of evidence. If all evidence is collected, you're to inform the FBI. As if figuring out the correct routes and trades wasn't hard enough, frequent system malfunctions and security checks test your skill as well...</desc>

On the way there are numerous enemy space ships that the player can attempt to shoot down. Doing so reduces enemy flak which might prevent the player from reaching the base. Among the enemy ships there are different types of fighters, saucers, sensors and robots. Each ship has a specific target area that has to be hit such as the antenna of the surveillance ship. The player's ship has a limited amount of ammunition and fuel which decreases when steering or changing speeds. If successful in destroying the enemy base, the player's ship is refuelled and gets an ammunition refill before heading out to the next level which is at a higher difficulty.</desc>

As longer and more difficult missions are completed, the player's rank increases from the starting level of Raven through Shrike, Vulture, Darter, Condor, Swift, Nighthawk, Falcon, Eagle, and finally Starbird.
A secret mission at the end of the game is accessible by typing in a password mailed by the software company after the player completes the last registered mission and receives a number code. The code is then mailed to "Project Halley" (in reality the software company that designed the game) on a pre-packaged postcard.

		<desc>Halloween is a first-person shooter with a Halloween theme. The gameplay is a bit different from other 3D shooters as it involves a time limit.

More than 10 levels are to complete.</desc>

		<name>Hard Hat Mack</name>
		<desc>Hard Hat Mack is a platform game similar in concept to Donkey Kong. The player controls a worker who must complete specific objectives in a construction site while avoiding enemies and trying not to run out of time. The game has three vertical levels consisting of simple paths, springboards, conveyor belts, and elevators. The goals involve replacing holes in the floor, catching a moving jackhammer to secure plates, collecting lunchboxes, and dropping wares into a processor. The titular hero loses a life when hit by falling bolts or tagged by wandering vandals or OSHA representatives. The game is over after the player character loses three lives. Completing the three unique levels brings the player back to the beginning, with the game cycling through the same levels at a faster speed.</desc>

		<name>Head On</name>
		<desc>Head-On is an arcade racing game and the first known game where the player has to collect dots (a year before Pac-Man). Viewed from a top down perspective, the player has to race around a circuit consisting of five lanes and collect all the dots that lies scattered around. At the same time he has to watch out for the jam cars that move in the opposite direction. To dodge the jam cars the player swap lanes which can only be done in the middle of each straight. To move faster it's possible to accelerate but then it's only possible to change one lane at a time. At normal speed two lanes can be crossed in one move. A level is completed when all dots have been collected and when colliding with a jam car a life is lost. The game is over when all three lives are lost. As the player progresses through the levels he will come across more and faster jam cars. In later levels as many as three fast jam cars will be in his way.</desc>

		<path>./Helicopter Rescue (1983)(B.I.S.).dsk</path>
		<name>Helicopter Rescue</name>
		<desc>Games back in the early 1980s often had descriptive titles. Helicopter Rescue is one of them: you have to use an helicopter to rescue stranded pilots in the desert and in the sea.

The player controls the helicopter with the joystick, moving up to fly up and down to land. Once the helicopter is in the air, the player can choose to go left or right. Going left takes the player to a desert scenario, where the game field is in 2.5D. Moving the joystick up flies the helicopter ahead, moving it down lands the helicopter to pick up pilots. In the desert, tanks will try to shoot the helicopter down and capture the pilots before the player can rescue them. To shoot them, the helicopter must be moving vertically. Flying to the right of the main screen takes the player to a sea scenario, where the same rules as the desert apply, but as expected, instead of tanks the enemies here are ships.

The helicopter has a fuel meter which, when depleted, will make the helicopter crash. The helicopter gets refueled when the player lands on the home base and returns rescued pilots. Each round has the player trying to rescue 8 pilots. The round ends when all 8 pilots are either rescued or killed.</desc>

In the game you play as a professor, who has to make his way out, by pushing the right puzzle tiles together, till none is left. Those tiles can also be used to squash enemies, but be careful, as the very same tiles can also squash you. The game features a month-system. After December 31, the game is over for you, if there are still tiles left. You can also go on vacations, which are basically the pauses in the game.</desc>

Fight off the onrush of vertigo as you grope through the treacherous, tunnel maze in the treasure-laden Tepotzteco Pyramid. Tighten your grip as you dangle from the wing of an airborne World War I DeHavilland. Whatever it takes, Indiana Jones must stop the cruel Nazi, Plebinheim, and his SS thugs from unleashing the power of the Mazatec Power Key against the world. Vicious bats, venomous snakes, marauding bandits - even for the daring Indiana Jones, this is going to be tough!</desc>

		<name>Inhumane</name>
		<desc>Awakening in an abandoned archaeological desert dig site, the player of this rudimentary, sophomoric satirical text adventure (derived from Infocom's Infidel) is brought up to speed through plot-advancing notes kindly left behind by Francisco Roboff (on loan from the Mask of the Sun), a "friend" who returned to civilization with all the treasures he'd surreptitiously excavated from the pyramid dig site save one, the golden coffin he couldn't find -- and left his old pal behind to unearth.

After some cursory to-ing and fro-ing, the player accesses the subterranean vaults of the buried pyramid, discovering no fewer than nine different deathtraps and a peculiar motivation to experience them all first-hand.  Should the player succeed, in this self-effacing goal, boundless treasure awaits in the form of the golden coffin... as well as a somewhat inscrutable joke about the author's high school geometry class.</desc>

		<name>Injured Engine</name>
		<desc>Injured Engine is an educational simulation game that teaches how a car engine works. The player's task is to test run a faulty engine, figure out what is wrong and then fix the problem. The main screen shows a cross section of the engine and by moving a cursor over it the player gets information on its different components. Clicking on a component gives a closer view of it with text and images explaining how it functions.

As the engine is turned on the player has to monitor the instrument panel and listen to the noise to be able to figure out what is wrong. After locating the disorder the player can enter the repair shop mode to fix it. There it's possible to examine each part and to buy replacement parts. To measure the player's efficiency there is a meter on the instrument panel showing the cost per mile and the aim is to keep it low. 

In addition to the main mode there is a troubleshooter challenge mode. The difference is that this mode is timed with the player having to fix the problems as quick as possible. When starting out there are two broken parts and new faults will keep appearing until five major errors have been fixed.</desc>

		<desc>J-Bird is a conversion of the arcade game Q*Bert. The object of the game is to change all tiles in a pyramid to the target color by having J-Bird jump on the tile. Various creatures and objects can get in the way of J-Bird. These include a bouncing snake, cats, falling balls, and frogs. There are four rounds per level, and each level increases in difficulty by having more enemies onscreen and requiring more complicated rules for a tile to reach the target color (for example, on the second level you need to jump on each tile twice). On the sides of the pyramid are platforms which J-Bird can jump onto to evade the snake. If the snake is close enough to the platform when J-Bird jumps on, the snake will fall off the edge.</desc>

		<desc>Jungle Hunt offers four unique adventure experiences, which repeat with greater difficulty once all four have been survived.  If you don't survive these adventures, you will not only lose your own life but that of the lovely Penelope, who has been captured by cannibals!

The first part challenges your Tarzan skills - can you swing on the vines without plummeting to your doom?  The second part pits you against a whole bunch of nasty crocodiles in a mighty river.  Fortunately, you have a knife to fight back with.  Don't forget to go up for air!  In the third part, you face a battle against oncoming boulders of varying sizes and physics.  Once you've cleared all these treacherous hazards, you still must confront the dreaded cannibal, who is armed with a wicked spear.  Can you get past him and save the lovely Penelope?

Gameplay involves much strategic jumping and knife play (in the river/crocodile phase).  The view is always a side view, much like Pitfall! and later platform games.</desc>

Another plane takes the place of the damaged one, and the players uses this plane to take the hostages back to base. The plane can only carry two hostages, so return trips to the castle are usually required. Once all hostages in the level have been returned to base, the player proceeds to the next level.</desc>

		<name>Karate Champ</name>
		<desc>Karate Champ is an action fighting game for one or two players. The players compete against each other at nine different locations to see who has the best karate skills! To win a match, the player must win two of three rounds by knocking down his opponent  with a wide variety of karate moves. A full point or half a point is awarded for knocking your opponent down and the first player to gain a two point lead wins the round. Should the 30 second time limit for a round end, the player who has the most points wins. At the end of each match is a bonus round where the victor can earn extra points by knocking down flying objects that are tossed his way.</desc>

		<name>Kenuston's Professional Blackjack</name>
		<desc>As suggested by the title, this adaptation leverages the methods of famous blackjack strategist Ken Uston.  Focusing on completeness, the game simulates tables at more than 70 casinos across the US, and implements their different house rules in minute detail - from the number of decks to dealer behavior, surrendering, splitting, doubling, insurance bets and more.  A table can have up to 7 players; each can be controlled by a human or by the CPU, and given different cash amounts and betting units.  For even more variation, players can create their own casinos and customize the rules to their liking.

The game's stated purpose is to teach Uston's card-counting system.  To that end, it includes a series of drills to practice the four different strategies, arranged by skill level.  Computer-controlled players can be set to use any of these strategies during a game.  For further instruction, the game offers card count data displays, keeps statistics and can rate the players based on their performance given their chosen strategy.</desc>

		<path>./King Quest (1983)(Sierra)(Save)[nib].nib</path>
		<name>King Quest</name>
		<desc>Sir Graham is a brave knight who is sent on a quest to retrieve three treasures that were stolen by deception and stealth: a shield that protects its bearer from invaders, a mirror that foretells the future, and a treasure chest that is forever filled with gold. If Graham takes these treasures back to the royal castle, then the ailing King Edward the Benevolent of Daventry will hand over the crown. During his travels, Graham will meet characters that will either help or hinder him. 

King's Quest is commonly considered the progenitor of third-person-perspective adventure games. As opposed to earlier graphic adventures, the player is able to navigate the protagonist on screen in eight directions, creating an effect of three-dimensional exploration. The player character can also be obscured from view when hiding behind an object, is subjected to gravity, and has different animations for actions such as picking up an item, falling, swimming, etc. Graham can be moved around with arrow keys and perform various actions when the player types commands, normally consisting of noun and verb combinations (e.g. "Take flower", "Talk man", etc.).

The game world consists of a cyclic outdoor area with places of interest (houses, characters, etc.) that must be found through exploration. Much of the kingdom is accessible to Graham from the beginning, and there are only a few restrictions imposed on traveling. In order to complete the game, the player has to procure certain items and use them in correct situations or with specific characters. Some of the puzzles rely on fairy tales, and a good knowledge of those makes them easier to solve. 

The game awards the player points for most of the actions he makes Graham perform. Since some of those are not crucial to completion, it is quite possible to finish the game without having attained the full score. Some of the tasks in the game have multiple solutions, though the game may grant the player less points if he chooses the simpler one. Many hazards await Graham on his journey, and death is frequent if the player is not careful. The game can also be rendered unwinnable by failing to collect a specific item or wasting it.</desc>

		<name>King's Quest III - To Heir is Human</name>
		<desc>King Graham and Queen Valanice had two children, Alexander and Rosella, and the kingdom was once peaceful. It wasn't long until Alexander was snatched from his crib and things started to take a turn for the worse. A three-headed dragon threatens the ever-peaceful Daventry, and requires a maiden to be sacrificed every year. Rosella is the chosen one.

Meanwhile, in a secluded house atop a mountain in the land of Llewdor, the evil wizard called Manannan keeps a young lad named Gwydion as his slave, forcing him to do menial tasks as he prepares his spells and observes the country through his telescope. Gwydion must find a way to outsmart the wizard, escape, and eventually discover the truth about his own identity.

King's Quest III: To Heir is Human is an adventure game similar in basic gameplay mechanics to its predecessor The player navigates Gwydion with arrow keys and interacts with the environment by typing verb and noun combination commands. Llewdor consists of interconnected screens that loop once the player character reaches the border of the land. Throughout the course of the game, Gwydion will also travel to other locations and have a magic map at his disposal, allowing him to teleport to different areas.

There are more items to collect in this installment, and more complex actions required to execute, raising the difficulty level. A large part of the game proceeds in real time, with Mannanan following his own schedule, forcing the player to plan and time his actions. There is also a time limit imposed on the game's first major quest.</desc>

		<desc>Knights of the Desert is the operational level simulation of Rommel's famous North African Campaign of WWII. The game begins in March 1941 and ends in February 1943 in 12 turns each representing 2 months. Both players goals are the same. That is to sweep across the northern coast of Africa pushing the enemy as far back as possible capturing key towns such as Benghazi and Tobruk along the way. The only difference is the direction you are heading. As the German Commander your main goal is east to Alexandria. As the British Commander your main goal is to sweep Rommel all the way back to El Agheila and win the game. Knights of the Desert provides for solitaire play where the computer directs the British.</desc>

Thomas is able to move left and right, jump, duck, and punch and kick. Enemy projectiles such as knives can be kicked in the air to rebound them towards the enemy. On the top floor resides Mr. X himself.</desc>

Depending on how the prices are set during the day's weather conditions, players will either make a profit or lose money until the next day.

Lemonade stand is a single-player game or can be played with up to 30 players alternating turns.</desc>

		<name>Lode Runner</name>
		<desc>The Bungeling Empire has stolen a huge cache of gold from its rightful owners, and your mission is to infiltrate its treasury and recapture it. This entails progressing through 150 screens of platforms, ladders and ropes.

The Empire has sent robotic guards down to protect the gold, and contact with any of these will cost you a life. Your method of escaping them is to press fire to dig a hole in their line of movement, thus causing them to fall in briefly, allowing you to move across the gap safely. Once all the gold has been collected, a ladder allowing you to move onto the next screen is added. Completing these screens often requires forward planning and precision.

This was one of the earliest games to include a level editor, allowing the creation of new level designs with no programming skill.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, you must guide your spaceship around while picking up hostages located on the surface, and bring them to safety. Your task becomes difficult by lunar leepers who leap up and try to grab you or the hostages that are picked up by your ship.

If you approach a hostage while a leeper is nearby, the leeper will keep walking toward them until they are killed. If you are grabbed by a leeper, you lose a life. You can shoot at the leepers, but the catch is that you cannot shoot at them while they are on the surface, and you have limited ammo. You also have limited fuel, and if you are half-empty, you must refill at the gas depot in order to continue.</desc>

		<desc>This adaptation of the classic Chinese board game offers 100 level for single-player sessions, with three difficulty levels. The levels can also be played in a campaign mode, with twelve illustrated stations. The main aim of the game is to make pairs of blocks disappear on a board where they are stapled on different layers. Removing matching blocks reveals the ones below, until the entire board is cleared or the player is stuck. The game includes a help function and blocks can be immediately selected using the stylus. There are different themes of blocks to choose from, including classic Chinese characters but also more general symbol. The game keeps track of the remaining blocks, the score, and there is an undo function.</desc>

You play Cobra as he journeys vertically, taking out the mounted turrets and enemy cars as he goes. There are also colored turrets to shoot at - each colour represents a particular change to your car's performance (there are a few temporary negative ones alongside the upgrades). You have 16 smart bombs, which may sound generous, but just watch them go. A boss must be beaten at the end of each level.</desc>

Crabs, turtles and fighter flies must be cleared out by jumping underneath the platform they sit on, then kicking them away. Each level is cleared when a set number of coins is collected.

For the two player mode, the first to collect the set amount of coins wins.</desc>

When you die you enter a limbo room, in which one exit (randomly-selected by the game) restores Arabesque; the others result in death.

Every time you play, the bonus items are randomly placed, and the exact map layout is adjusted. There are over 1000 variations and ten skill levels. Much like today's FPS' there are vases to reload the gun and grant lives. They are reset at the beginning of each game hour.</desc>

		<desc>Microwave is an action game that contains four mazes that are viewed from a top down perspective. The player controls Teddy the Salvage Man who in each maze has to move around and collect a number of objects such as knives, hammers and calculators. Once they have been all collected an exit appears that transports Teddy to the next level. Teddy is chased by four different aliens (Trixy, Monty, Biff and Lurch) that have to be avoided or a life will be lost.

To fight off the aliens, Teddy has access to microwave dishes. By pressing the fire button one is dropped and a beam will shoot out as far as it can in the direction opposite of Teddy's movement. Aliens that are hit by it are destroyed although they will soon respawn somewhere in the maze. In addition to the aliens there are also grenades which has to be avoided as soon as they turn blue since that means they are about to explode.</desc>

		<desc>Midway Campaign is a computer simulation of the Battle of Midway Island in June 1942, arguably one of the most decisive battles in the history of warfare. The computer controls a huge force of Japanese ships whose objective is to invade and capture Midway Island. You command the badly outnumbered and outranged American forces with your only advantage being the element of surprise. The game ends if either all of one side's Aircraft Carriers are sunk, or any part of Japanese TF exits map to west or US TF exits map to east with no airstrikes in the air. At the end of the game a summary of all carrier damage, aircraft losses, and victory points from other targets and the Midway invasion are output followed by an evaluation of results.</desc>

		<desc>In Miner! the player's goal is to earn as much money as possible. To do this the player must mine for gold and sell when gold prices are high. The game uses a side view and the player owns a mine with an elevator that can be sent to various levels. The player can dig through the soil removing block by block. When digging there are various surprises the player can encounter. The most important is of course gold, but others like impenetrable granite, cave-ins, easily dug-out sandstone and loose footings will also be encountered by the player.

Outside of the mine the player can sell the gold he or she found. Gold prices fluctuate, so the player can try to find the best moment for selling. Each digging action the player undertakes costs money, so the player cannot wait too long or the mining operation will go bankrupt.</desc>

		<desc>You play the part of Bounty Bob, and it is your mission to explore every inch of an abandoned mine. As you walk over floor sections in the mine, the floor will change color. When all of the floor sections have been changed in color, you can move on to the next, more challenging level. To reach all of the floor sections, you will need to figure out how to get there.

You can jump (be careful not to fall too far though, or you will be squished), climb up and down ladders, and use different transportation devices that can be found on the levels (such as an elevator, slides, a springboard, or a cannon). Wandering around the mine are numerous radioactive creatures which get in Bounty Bob's way. Also scattered throughout the mines are various artifacts left behind; if Bounty Bob collects one of these, the creatures will temporarily become vulnerable. If Bounty Bob runs into one of the creatures in this state the creature will be destroyed, but if he runs into a creature while it is glowing Bounty Bob will be destroyed.

There is a total of ten different levels, and to complete them all you will need quick reflexes as well as to figure out a unique strategy for each level.</desc>

		<desc>Similar in gameplay to Minesweeper, Mines has you finding all the mines in a minefield.  Your goal is to cross the minefield without stepping on any mines.

Any space that you have seen will tell you how many mines are surrounding it.  Use this to your advantage to determine where the mines are located.  Step on a mine and it is all over.

The game allows you to choose how many mines there are in the level... from 30 to 160 mines in a 16x16 grid.

Unlike in Minesweeper, you cannot just click anywhere on the field to free up a space.  Your feet must "walk" around the field as if you were really there; finding mines.  Your objective is to walk from the top left corner of the field to the bottom right corner without stepping on any mines.   Not all mines have to be found to succeed.</desc>

		<name>Miniature Golf</name>
		<desc>This is a computer game simulation of a miniature golf course. It attempts to refine your sense of timing and your perceptiveness in judging distance. As in a traditional miniature golf course, a variety of obstacles are placed in your path to the cup. Depending on the game that is selected, the course can be played solo, or a two player competition can be initiated.

Rather than a full 18 holes, this miniature golf variation has a nine-hole half-course. Your goal is clear: taking the various obstacles into account, hit the ball through the course and complete each hole by knocking the ball into the cup. The number of attempts you make for a single hole is tallied as strokes. While total strokes are unlimited, each hole still has a specific par assigned to it. So ideally, you should make it your goal to not exceed the par assigned to each hole.

Using the standard joystick controller, you can position the club to adjust the strength and angle of how the ball is hit. Remember that no matter how many strokes have accrued, it is necessary to get the ball in the cup before the game continues on to the next hole.</desc>

Thunderhead is a once-desolate planet now teeming with life, thanks to the hated Eternals. They have set up an underground complex, which is their main power base. 

The game is split into two parts - Operation Tempest and The Final Appeal. In Operation Tempest you must find and activate the device needed to destroy the planet. In The Final Appeal you must find the items which will allow you to appeal the charges the Eternals hit you with.

Gameplay involves jumping and shooting - the player must collect the items which allow you to defeat monsters. There are also mazelike sections. Weapon power-ups and reloads can be found, as can extra lives. The game has 10 preset levels, and a seed number to allow over 1000 variations of play.</desc>

		<name>Hi-Res Adventure 1 - Mystery House</name>
		<desc>This game is an historical piece of video gaming all by itself!

Mystery House is an adventure game released by On-Line Systems in 1980. It was designed, written and illustrated by Roberta Williams and programmed by Ken Williams for the Apple II. Mystery House is the very first graphical adventure game and the first game produced by On-Line Systems, the company which would evolve into Sierra On-Line. It is one of the earliest horror video games. 

The game starts near an abandoned Victorian mansion. The player is soon locked inside the house with no other option than to explore. The mansion contains many interesting rooms and seven other people: Tom, a plumber; Sam, a mechanic; Sally, a seamstress; Dr. Green, a surgeon; Joe, a gravedigger; Bill, a butcher; and Daisy, a cook.

Initially, the player has to search the house in order to find a hidden cache of jewels. However, terrible events start happening and dead bodies (of the other people) begin appearing. It becomes obvious that there is a murderer on the loose in the house, and the player must discover who it is or become the next victim.</desc>

		<desc>Moon Patrol is a side-scrolling game where the player must drive a moon buggy from one station on the Moon to another, all while avoiding crashing or getting destroyed by alien ships. The vehicle is constantly moving right and the player can speed up or slow down, jump, and shoot (simultaneously firing upwards and forwards.) There are 25 checkpoints along the way, each symbolized with a letter from A to Z, and serving as a respawn point. Every five checkpoints mark a separate "stage" within the entire course; reaching the end of a stage under the par time grants a large score bonus. 

Dangers on the Moon include rocks (small and big ones) which can be shot to pieces or jumped over, pits which must be jumped, and UFO's which fire at the player or bombard the ground (creating pits). Later the player also comes upon stationary tanks which fire missiles (that can be destroyed with the player's own shots), landmines, carnivorous plants that pop up out of pits, and rocket cars which stalk the buggy from behind before rushing forward in an attempt to ram it down. 

After completing the first course (the "Beginner Course") the player can try his skill on the harder Champion Course.</desc>

Shortly afterwards, she began seeing a ghost-like figure, a mysterious White Lady, who has allegedly been haunting the castle for centuries. A series of events and dark suspicions involving hidden treasure convince Tamara that her life is in danger. She contacts a friend of hers, a young American detective, asking him to travel to the castle and investigate the mystery.  

Moonmist is a text adventure game. In the beginning the player chooses between four different scenarios, represented by the colors red, blue, yellow and green. Each scenario has different tasks, a different criminal, and different treasure. The game has a built-in clock, and must be completed before 6:00 am in-game time, otherwise it ends prematurely. Depending on the player's choice of the protagonist's gender, characters may react differently to his or her actions.</desc>

		<desc>You control Mr. Do has he tries to harvest all of the cherries on the screen. However, there are numerous bad guys out to get him! Mr. Do can defend himself from the badguys in two ways: first he can push the apples located throughout the playfield on top of the enemies and crush them. Secondly, Mr. Do is armed with a power ball. This can be thrown to destroy an enemy. Mr. Do has only one power ball, though, so he will need to wait for it to return to him before it can be used again. From time to time an alpha monster will appear on the screen bearing one of the letters in EXTRA. If you use the power ball to destroy an alpha monster you earn that letter; when you've earned the complete word EXTRA you receive an extra life. When you successfully collect all of the cherries, you will move on to the next, more difficult level.

The mobile version of the game includes the original arcade version, as well as an enhanced mode with new levels, power-ups and graphics.</desc>

		<desc>The year is 1936. You are in flight on the dirigible Zinderneuf and a murder has just been discovered! As the only detective on board the ship, it is your job to discover who the murderer is before landing. 

The game is played from a top down view of the Zinderneuf. In order to solve the case, you will need to find enough evidence to accuse the correct person. Clues can be found by searching the various rooms, and also from interrogating the fifteen passengers on board. When you come across a passenger, you can question them by being polite, forceful, naive, or whatever approach you think will get you the most information. You can even ignore passengers, but ignoring someone now may make them reluctant to help you later! By piecing the evidence together you need to come up with the killer before time runs out. 

You may play the game as one of eight different detectives. Each time you play, the killer, his/her motive, and the various clues will be different.</desc>

		<desc>The year is 1966, shortly after USA deployed its troops to participate in the Vietnam War. Alan "The Bear" Westmoreland, a Marine Corps sergeant, is sent behind the enemy lines. He is known for his high endurance, achieved by ingesting various stimulants. As long as these drugs keep him going, the Bear isn't afraid of danger, and is used by his superiors for missions with overwhelming odds. The raid turns into total warfare; with only a small team at his side, the Sergeant will have to do everything he is capable of in order to survive.

NAM is a military-themed first-person shooter that uses the Build engine. The protagonist has to fight his way through the jungle, with various weapons such as M16, M60, M79, LAW, and others. The missions range from urban gun battles to sneaking in the thick jungles and man-made tunnels under the ground. The battlefields are frequented by air strikes, anti-personnel mines (which the player can spot with a mine detector), fire fights, ambushes, snipers and tanks. Fellow soldiers will aid Alan in battle, though for the most part he'll have to depend on himself.

A multiplayer battle is included, featuring 19 multiplayer levels with different game modes like Gruntmatch, Capture-the-flag and Fireteam, where each player is allowed to select a soldier type and is sent on different missions.</desc>

		<path>./Nato Commander (1984)(Microprose)[cr].dsk</path>
		<name>Nato Commander</name>
		<desc>The first wargame from legendary game designer Sid Meier, NATO Commander puts the player in charge of the armies of Western Europe as the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact forces plunge across central Europe in a hypothetical Cold War-turned-World War III scenario.

The game design would serve as the foundation for the MicroProse Command Series of wargames, so it is no surprise that NATO Commander and those later MicroProse games are very similar.  Combat takes place in accelerated real-time, though the player can freeze to survey the field and issue orders.  Commanding is basically a matter of picking the right "modes" for individual units and moving them into position for attack or defense, monitoring unit morale, assigning air wings to various tasks (air superiority, ground support, or reconnaissance), and making judicious use of the chemical and nuclear weapons at the player's disposal.

There are four difficulty levels and five different scenarios to choose from, and the player has the option of using larger divisions or smaller brigades as the standard unit size.  Victory points are determined by political (city captures, chemical and nuclear weapons use, pre-emptive attack, etc.) and combat (casualties and loss of territory) factors.  

Key political events occur during the course of the war, such as labor strikes and declarations of neutrality by certain European nations.  The final outcome is eventually determined when accumulated political and combat losses force one of the two sides to accept defeat.</desc>

		<desc>Nibbler is a variant of Rock-Ola's arcade game of the same name. 

A cruel witch has turned everyone around her, including the player, into strange animals known as wondrous wurpels. In the garden of the witch there are many charms lying around and if these are collected the spell can be lifted. The player himself can't move though, so he has to get help from a snake, Nibbler, who has to make his way through the nine sections of the garden and collect all the charms. 

The game plays similar to Pac-Man albeit without any enemies that chases the player. For each level Nibbler has to collect most of the charms (a few can be left behind). The problem is that the snake grows every second, making things harder since it will lose a life if it collides with its own tail. A life is also lost if the snake stands still too long without moving. The game is over when all five lives are lost.</desc>

		<name>Norad</name>
		<desc>Norad is an action strategy game where the player has to defend the United States from a nuclear attack. The premise is similar to Missile Command but the gameplay differs. The game is played on a map of the United States and the player has access to ten missile sites that are used to defend the same number of cities. As enemy intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) appear in the sky, the player launches an anti-ballistic missile (ABM) by pressing the number of one of the sites and steers it towards the target before hitting the space bar to detonate it when it is within range.

Each site has a limited amount of missiles but these are replenished between waves as long as its connected city has not been destroyed. A non-damaged city produces five ABMs for its site while one that has take one hit builds two. A city is totally destroyed when it has taken two hits and will not produce any more missiles but the site will still be able to launch those that are in its stockpile. A site that is hit will lose its entire stockpile. Cities that have taken only one hit will repair themselves between waves. On later levels a defensive MX site is available. It can be moved on a fixed roadway and is not dependent on a city. It is restocked from along its movement path and due to its mobility it can not be hit. There is also a nuclear submarine that works similarily but that is restricted to the Carribean.</desc>

		<name>North Atlantic 86</name>
		<desc>This operational level turn-based strategy wargame represents a fictional conflict between Soviet and NATO air, land, surface-naval and submarine forces for control of the North Atlantic. The NATO forces must be commanded by a human player. The Soviet forces may be
commanded by either a human or the computer. Players need to organize their ships into task forces to perform various missions: sea lane interdiction, land bombardment, supply/troop transport, evacuation, etc. Gameplay revolves around the creation and manipulation of these task forces and the effective concentration of air power. Included are campaign games covering September 7 to December 31, 1986 and November 1 to December 31, 1986, mini-games covering the invasion of Iceland in November 1986, and a North Atlantic convoy operation in September 1986.

North Atlantic Theatre is represented on a 40 x 40 square grid map. Each square measures 100 km in width. Squares are land, ocean, bases, Soviet task forces, and NATO task forces. The range between squares is calculated as a distance between their centers. Each game turn represents the passage of 12 hours and consists of: building and adjusting friendly task forces; moving these task forces; launching air missions; launching missile attacks; combat resolution. Upon completion of the combat phase of each turn, the game progress may be saved to restore it later.</desc>

As the tension mounts while you are conducting espionage, building bombers, missiles, submarines and anti ballistic missiles either you or your neighbor launch a pre-emptive first strike.The nuclear destruction continues until either  all weapons are expended or a truce is negotiated. Victory is determined by population remaining and world political opinion which is usually against the side that started the war. If both sides lose enough people neither will win.</desc>

		<desc>Objective: Kursk is a grand-tactical level game covering the Fourth Panzer Army attacks against the Soviet forces on the south flank of the Kursk salient. Each game turn consists of 12 hours of operations. Operations consist of suppling and moving combat forces, changing formation, planning assaults, air strikes, artillery bombardments and resolving air combat situations. The game map covers the battlefields on the south flank of the Kursk salient, from Kursk in the north to Belgorod in the south. Movement around the map is controlled by a hexagon grid system with each hexagon representing three miles. German forces are controlled by the human player and the Soviet forces can be controlled by either computer or human. Forces on both sides are pre-assigned at the beginning of each game. Each opponent will have five phases to prepare for battle and then a combat phase starts after. Game will end on 7-15-43 or you defeat your opponent before that date. Victory points are awarded for the control of towns and for surviving combat forces.</desc>

		<path>./Old Ironsides (1983)(Xerox Education).dsk</path>
		<name>Old Ironsides</name>
		<desc>Old Ironsides is a two player game that simulates nineteenth century naval combat. The action takes place on a single screen in which each player controls a three-masted sailing vessel. The speed and movement of the ships is determined by the wind. The wind is always blowing from south to north, making southward movement difficult unless a player tacks and navigates his ship in a zigzag manner.

Each ship is equipped with twelve cannons, six on each side of the ship, and a supply of powder. The goal of the game is to defeat the opposing player in battle. A player loses if either their ship is sunk or if they get lost in the fog.

Sinking a vessel can be achieved by cannon fire or by ramming. Cannons fire perpendicular to the direction of travel. As a ship takes damage, a status indicator will slowly fill with red and a ship will lose cannons, thereby decreasing their firepower. Occasionally, an especially accurate broadside will hit an opponents magazine, instantly destroying the adversary's ship. As players fire cannons, their powder supply will deplete. Powder regenerates itself at a rate much slower than the rate of fire, so players must always be aware of their stockpile.

If a ship moves off the edge of the screen, it is said to be, "in the fog." A ship that  stays in the fog too long loses the battle. A series of increasingly higher pitched beeps warn the player that their time is running out. Navigation in the fog is aided by a compass display at the top of the screen. This indicator shows the ship's bearing at any given time and can be switched off if a player wishes to hide their movements in the fog.</desc>

		<name>Olympic Decathlon</name>
		<desc>A simulation of the 10-event Olympic Decathlon, this early game was basically a series of 10 arcade games back to back. The player used the keyboard to control how fast the character would go in a race or when to throw the javelin, for example. Decathlon also had a training mode which let you play any of the events individually.

A nice feature about the game is that up to six players could play the game in hot seat mode. Several of the events were one player at a time, but many of the races were two at a time, giving you some live competition. You were scored based on your performance at each event and the player with the highest total at the end was awarded the gold medal.
The ultimate challenge was to try to beat Bruce Jenner, winner of the Decathlon in the 1976 games.</desc>

		<name>Pacman</name>
		<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde).  One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze.  During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points.  This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghosts' eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

		<desc>The young sorceress Nikki, the court jester Fargus, and his side-kick Sid the puppet are the three main protagonists of this 3D platform game. While attending a "Wizards in Training" seminar, Nikki accidentally casts a powerful magic spell, which results in a giant monsters swallowing the whole village. The three friends must now travel to a place called "Wishing Engine", and be granted a wish to revert the world back to normal.

The characters each have a special movement to kill enemies with. The game uses floating camera angles through a vast Prince of Persia-style world. The goal of the game is to clear the various levels, avoiding spikes and enemies and collecting coins for extra lives.

Unlike most 3D platformers, Pandemonium offers only two-dimensional movement, rather than complete freedom of movement. The characters move along a curving 2D course within a 3D environment.</desc>

		<desc>Phantoms Five is a vertically scrolling action game where the player controls a plane and has to bomb various targets beneath him. The plane is set on auto-pilot and moves automatically forward with the player only controlling the horizontal movement with a paddle. Points are earned for successfully hitting targets such as headquarters, fuel dumps, post offices and roads. There are also some targets to avoid such as red cross hospitals and prisoners of war camps. Hitting these will lead to a loss of points. At the same time the player has to watch out for fire from anti-aircraft guns. Getting hit will lead to a loss of a life and a restart at a lower level.

At times the player will encounter enemy fighter planes. The game then switches to a first person perspective where the player aims left and right with the paddle and has to shoot down the fighters with the machine gun before they shoot down him.</desc>

		<name>Pipe Dream</name>
		<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.

Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".</desc>

Up to four players compete with each other and the computer to stake valuable mining claims throughout the solar system, while the mining council has stationed patrol ships throughout the system to make sure everyone follows the rules. Thus begins several weeks of intensive exploration, political maneuvering, sabotage, and claim jumping which will decide the course of the economic exploitation of outer space for the next hundred years. You have the opportunity to guide your family to a commanding economic position in the solar system. The game can also be played solitaire against the computer.</desc>

The gameplay is the same as in the arcade original with the player having control of a ship that has to destroy the surrounding asteroids. The ship can be rotated and is moved by using thrust to send it forward. There is also the possibility of entering hyperspace which sends the ship to a random location on the screen. Larger asteroids break into 2 smaller pieces if shot, and they 2 smaller pieces again. These final tiny pieces can be shot and destroyed. In addition to the asteroids there are star dockings which appear that are worth bonus points if shot.
The player moves on to the next level when all asteroids in a field are destroyed. They start with 3 ships, and when all are lost it's game over.</desc>

		<path>./Pool of Radiance v1.1 (1989)(SSI)(Save).dsk</path>
		<name>Pool of Radiance</name>
		<desc>Located on the northern shore of the Moonsea in Forgotten Realms, Phlan was once a flourishing trade city. However, lately monsters began settling in it, gradually turning whole districts into ruins. Only New Phlan remained under human control, but its inhabitants are afraid to venture into the monster-infested areas. In order to clean the nearby Barren River and rebuild Phlan, local authorities spread rumors about alleged riches hidden somewhere in the city. A party of adventurers, attracted by these news, sails towards Phlan and accepts the quest.

Pool of Radiance is the first adaptation of the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing system in a computer game format. In the beginning of the game the player can use a pre-made party of six characters or create each of them from scratch. Six races (human, elf, dwarf, gnome, halfling, and half-elf) and four classes (fighter, cleric, wizard, and thief) are available. The player can tweak the attributes of the characters and assign a moral alignment to each one.

Exploration of the town and hostile areas (dungeons) is viewed from a first-person perspective in a pseudo-3D world. Enemy encounters are random and take place on separate isometric combat screens, where player-controlled party and enemies take turns fighting each other. Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies, and characters level up after having accumulated set amounts. Fighters gain more attacks, thieves become proficient in backstabbing, while clerics and wizards can memorize more spells to cast before they need to rest. Non-human characters can also "multi-class" (learn the abilities of another class) when leveling up.

The NES version was substantially different from other versions. It removed references to the Adventure's Journal and some of the more complex features of the computer versions, like different currency units. Battles were significantly reduced in size, the graphics were overhauled and redesigned so that the game could be controlled with a control pad, and music was written for it. A randomly generated dungeon feature was also removed.</desc>

		<desc>High-resolution graphics remake of the text-based adventure game inspired by the cult-classic British television show about a former spy who is abducted and sent to a resort-themed "prison" where his captors attempt to get him to reveal why he resigned from his classified job. The game takes place on "The Island," where the player travels from building to building, each hosting a metaphorical quest in which the player's creative thinking skills are tested. Players demonstrating individual thinking eventually gain access to the Island's "Caretaker," and their ensuing conversation (using a language parser) can lead to the player's freedom.</desc>

The game is viewed from overhead, with the entire hole on a single screen. The player must choose a club, then a shot power, and then a shot direction, before executing the planned shot by pressing space once to start the swing, and again to execute it ? imprecise timing can impart draw or fade onto the shot. On the green you must choose the shot power before the direction, taking an overall slope into account. There is no indication as to how far the ball is from the hole.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, you guide a marker which must draw rectangles and other weird objects in order to claim your territory, and you can either draw these rectangles fast or slow. Drawing the rectangles using the "slow" method awards you the most points. Once a rectangle has been made, it will be colored in to show that you have claimed your territory. While drawing the rectangles, you need to watch out for Qix (pronounced "kicks"), a series of colored lines that crawl the screen. In addition to Qix, you also need to avoid the Sparks who travel around the border, as well as any lines that you have made, as well as The Fuse, who travels along the line that you are drawing. Once you have claimed enough territory, you proceed to the next level.</desc>

		<desc>RDF 1985 is the sequel to Germany 1985 and is the second game in the When Superpowers Collide series.

The game is a strategic simulation of a conflict between the forces of the United States and the Soviet Union. While the battle rages in Germany, Soviet paratroopers land in the Middle East to capture strategic oil fields. The United States responds by sending in the Rapid Deployment Force (RDF) to recapture the oil fields. There is only one scenario. Victory conditions are simple: the player controlling the greatest number of towns and oil fields after a certain number of game turns is the winner.</desc>

		<name>Racter</name>
		<desc>From the Racter FAQ:
In 1984, William Chamberlain published a book called "The Policeman's Beard is Half Constructed" (Warner Books, NY. 0-446-38051-2, paper $9.95). The introduction claims: "With the exception of this introduction, the writing in this book was all done by computer." 

The authorship is attributed to RACTER, originally "written in compiled BASIC on a Z80 with 64k of RAM."Racter strings together words according to "syntax directives", and the illusion of coherence is increased by repeated re-use of text variables.  This gives the appearance that Racter can actually have a conversation with the user that makes some sense, unlike Eliza, which just spits back what you type at it.  Of course, such a program has not been written to perfection yet, but Racter comes somewhat close.  

Since some of the syntactical mistakes that Racter tends to make cannot be avoided, the decision was made to market the game in a humorous vein, which the marketing department at Mindscape dubbed "tongue-in-chip software" and "artificial insanity".</desc>

		<desc>As Tal, your job is to single-handedly clear out the aliens who have invaded a desolate and destroyed post-nuclear earth. To have any chance of this, he must locate a sacred suit of armor. Not only will this protect him from radiation, and allow him to withstand some enemy contact, it also heals him, and enables him to float.

This means that the game has two distinct styles, with your character limited to jumping, and with only rocks (located around the screens) to throw. Once he finds the suit he can fly around the ledges, shoot the inbuilt Pulsar beam, and survive within the volcanic hideout the aliens have based themselves. You will need to recharge the suit at times, and also take it off to pass through tight caverns.</desc>

		<name>Raid Over Moscow</name>
		<desc>The USSR has launched a huge attack on the USA, and the only hope for the free world is for you (as leader of a US Squadron of fighters) to destroy their defense bases. This is done in a multi-stage action game with some similarities to the same developer's Beach Head. All the mini-games must be completed before the time limit on the bomb is expired.

The first thing you will see is a missile being launched; the game then takes you to your hangar, from which you must quickly launch as many ships as possible, a task made difficult by the limited gravity. You must then fly it into Soviet airspace in a side-view shoot 'em up section, in which staying low keeps you safe from radars, and quick reactions see you shoot enemy fighters and avoid trees.

The next scene takes place on a single-screen view, with five windows to shoot through, and enemies aiming at you to be avoided. You then reach the base, and must shoot out approaching enemies. Finally, you must use discs onto a wall, such that they rebound to hit maintenance robots, with the ultimate goal of causing the base to overheat, the Soviet attack to be thwarted, and the US to be saved.</desc>

		<desc>George, Lizzy and Ralph were just ordinary Americans, until an experiment went wrong, turning them into a Gorilla, Lizard and Werewolf respectively. Following this, the three of them plan to go round destroying buildings, and up to 3 human players can join in.

Smashing at the edges of the buildings for long enough will make them collapse. The police and military are after you, and will shoot at you, so try to destroy them (failing that, you can avoid the bullets). You will need to eat regularly, with things like plants on offer, to avoid shrinking back to being human.</desc>

There are a total of eight enemies on screen at any given time. The Quarriers try to build the enemy base by stealing parts of yours. The Drayns steal energy from you and then supply it to the enemy. Fortunately you can steal back the energy they take, but you can't steal back parts of your base. The other six enemies just try to kill you. The bigger the enemy base gets, the more rapidly and accurately they can launch enemies at you.</desc>

		<name>Rescue Raiders</name>
		<desc>Simulated strategic war game players use a helicopter to attack enemy ground and air targets, and give air coverage for the ground forces you deploy onto the battlefield.

In 1984, you're transported back to World War II in Europe, 1944 at the battle of Normandy on D-Day. An evil group of terrorists possess the time machine and taken with them modern weapons and technology to change the course of history by hoping to control future economic, political  direction and to rule to the present.
Your troops are essential to completing the mission of destroying the enemy's headquarters (time machine). Vehicles include; anti-aircraft missile carrier targets enemy helicopters, tanks has armed canons and machines guns to tackle enemy mobile units, and demolition team vehicles disguised as ambulance or van are sent last to finish the job. Airborne infantry are wearing parachutes with light fire body armor and automatic machine guns, can occupy barracks and bunkers, while Engineers repair structures.
The helicopter able to pick-up men and is equipped with a machine gun, high explosive bomb and later a long range "home in" missile on a specified target. Launching from your helicopter pad that's also, a re-fueling, weapons re-arming, repair station and near the location of your headquarters.  Danger is in the air by enemy barrage balloons attached to moving mooring lines or attack helicopters to ground as artillery guns, tanks, troops and missile launchers try to halt your progress.
Every fifteen seconds, you receive payment for the amount of time spent in combat. This covers the cost of your ground deployments (men, tanks, etc), equipment and additional helicopters to a certain limit. Financial and combat readiness report can be obtained from 'command computer' including current prices.
Spanning eight missions each more difficult. As the game evolves rapid technological advances occur which may change some weapons.
Scores are given on the balance of total cost of battle and level of destruction done to the enemy. They're deducted for each mobile unit used and length of battle e.g. longer lower score.
Similar play style to Choplifter, but more sophisticated.
In 1990, re-released and updated as Armor Alley on PC and Apple Macintosh.</desc>

		<name>Ribbit</name>
		<desc>Ribbit is a Frogger variant which in most ways works just the same as the arcade original. The player controls a frog that first has to cross a interstate highway without being hit by a vehicle and then a river without falling into the water. The aim of the game is to reach the holes on the opposite end and get a frog into each hole. When successful the game moves on to the next level where traffic moves faster and the river has less logs and turtles to jump onto. The player starts out with three lives and one is lost every time the frog is hit, falls in the river, moves outside the screen or doesn't move quick enough. Each frog has about 35 seconds to reach a hole. Later levels have some surprises including a stomper trying to get the player.

In addition to the regular mode, there is also a demo mode. The demo mode has no limit on the number of lives but there is neither any scoring shown on the screen.</desc>

		<name>Ringside Seat</name>
		<desc>Ringside Seat is a realistic simulation of professional boxing, allowing the player to manage the greatest fighters of all time - the game includes data for over 45 great fighters past and present. It can be played as a two-player, one player against the computer, or a no-player (computer managed fight) game.

Select a fighter, choose one of eight weight classes or divisions, the number of rounds (3-15) and, should your fighter have the ability to fight as either a boxer or slugger, his fighting style. You will then decide whether you prefer to have the cumulative judges' scores displayed while the fight is in progress or at the end of the fight.

Both managers select their fighter's strategy each round. Strategy options are Fight Flat Footed, Cover Up, Charge In, Stick &amp; Move, Stay Away, Go For The Knockout and Protect Cuts. Once both managers have selected their strategy, the round bell will ring and the two fighters will approach the center ring. Using text and semi-animated screen display, you will see the fight in the ring as it happens, blow-by-blow, round-by-round.
Each fighter is rated in over 25 categories such as strength, stamina and style. You have the ability to save our fighter and are also given the ability to save a fight in progress to resume at a later date.</desc>

The players participate in a virtual world conquest: each player chooses a country to control, with the goal of engaging in war against the other countries, eventually dominating the whole world. The players are able to draft troops, build armies, move them on the map, and fortify their positions. Dice rolls are absent from the game; the victory depends on the player's actions more than on luck.</desc>

		<name>Robot Battle</name>
		<desc>Robot Battle was a programming game in which players used RSL (Robot Scripting language) to create robots which they then used to battle other player?s creations on-line. A fee was charged for entry into these contests, early contests cost $10 to enter but this was reduced to $5 in 1995.

The game was developed and released by Brad Schick in 1994 and at that time the robots were 2D and were viewed top down. It went through many upgrades and versions before being sold to GarageGames in 2004.
There is a story behind the game which sees robot fighting become legal in the year 4000. As a newly graduated programmer you have been asked to build a fighting robot to represent the Vega system in the Intergalactic Robot Battle Contest. Succeed and you may never have to work again, fail and ?you'll probably end up writing new versions of Vega Calculator in some half-forgotten VegaSoft building on one of the twenty moons of Vega Panet.? 

Robot Battle (version 1.2) of the software came with these pre-configured robots Corners, Events, Fire, Rammer, Shell, Side and Target. The scripting for each could be viewed and used as the basis for new designs which could then be tested in a local battle and/or be swapped with other members of the community. It came with three .exe files;winrob.exe: This is the main game and is used to set up local battles between robots
distrib.exe: Is a program that scrambles a robots code, this is used when swapping robots with other members of the Robot Battle community. Robots scrambled by this process could not be entered into contests, 'plain' code had to be used for that..
contest.exe: Used to submit player details, robots, and make payments when entering competitions.</desc>

		<name>Robot Rascals</name>
		<desc>Control a Robot Rascal in a turn-based scavenger hunt that mixes strategy, action and board-game elements.

The game included a set of physical cards, which told you what you needed to hunt for in the field or Laustenfownd. The first to find all the objects in their hand of cards wins.

Luck cards can affect the outcome of the game. They give the player the chance to modify their hand, often at the expense of another player. Steal card, Force Swap among players or pass your trash either left or right are examples of the effects of a Luck Card. Each player must draw a Luck card at the beginning of their turn.

The game allows you to choose among 10 different types of robots to use in your hunt, each with their own personality and style. You must also mind the type of terrain you wander into, because some types may damage your robot.

The game also featured handicapping options, and, like most common card games, featured many variations of the original game by changing the way the cards are discarded, exchanged or displayed on the board.</desc>

		<name>Robots of Dawn</name>
		<desc>In this text adventure based on Isaac Asimov's science fiction detective novel The Robots of Dawn, the player takes the role of Earth detective Elijah Baley, who is sent to the Spacer world of Aurora to investigate the murder of Dr. Han Falstofe, a prominent roboticist and constructor of humaniform robots. Suspects include Falstofe's political and professional rival Dr. Kelden Amadiro, his surrogate daughter Gladia, his biological daughter Vasilia, or ladies' man Gremionis, who was rejected by Gladia. Even Baley's robot friend and partner, R. Daneel Olivaw is not free of suspicion. In addition to the investigation, Baley must also deal with his fear of open spaces on Aurora, a result of having spent his entire life in enclosed spaces on the overcrowded Earth. Also, most Aurorans will not exactly be willing to help Baley due to anti-Earth sentiment.

As typical with adventure games in the detective genre, puzzles are less based on item manipulation but more on gathering evidence and questioning suspects. In each game played, the murderer might be a different one - the location of items and people's reaction to questions differ accordingly. To convict the killer, Baley must determine motive, means and opportunity and present his evidence to the Chairman of Aurora.</desc>

		<name>Run for the Money</name>
		<desc>Run for the Money is an educational game about running a business. The game is for two players who share the same screen to move around their characters. The characters are bizlings, space travellers who have crash landed on Planet Simian. The crash has caused damage to the ship's paint shield and before they can leave they need to acquire paint.

To buy the needed paint it is first necessary to make some money. This is done by producing and selling synannas (synthetic bananas) to the Simian population. First the players have to acquire a raw material called ruf which is done by moving the bizling to one of the six rufhouses located on the screen. Each rufhouse has its own price which indicates its quality. After entering a rufhouse the player can wait for the price to drop but there is a risk that the seller will decide to not sell. After buying the rufs they can be brought to the space ship and manufactured into synannas which the Simians then will pick up and pay for. Sometimes it's necessary to advertise which is done by turning on a sign.

The price is set at $40 when starting out but after each week the player can set their own prices. At the end of each week the players will get information in the form of graphs on how they are doing. The players also get access to a prediction machine which can be used to see what might happen with the profits in the coming week. Awards are then given to the player that gets closest to the predictions made.

Paint can be bought from a scientist that moves around in a paint van. When it stops there will be an auction for each bucket of paint with the highest bidder getting it. The player that buys the paint can then begin painting the shield. After every two weeks it is possible to attempt a launch of the space ship. The shield does not have to be fully painted but the more paint it has the better the chances are.</desc>

		<name>Sabotage</name>
		<desc>The player controls a gun turret at the bottom of the screen. The turret can swivel to cover a large area of the screen, but cannot move from its base. Helicopters fly across the screen at varying heights, dropping paratroopers. The gun may fire multiple shots at once, and the shots may destroy helicopters or shoot paratroopers. Paratroopers may be disintegrated by a direct hit, or their parachutes may be shot, in which case they will plummet to earth (splattering and dying if they were sufficiently high when the shot hit). Furthermore, destroyed helicopters turn into shrapnel, which may destroy other helicopters or paratroopers. Periodically, jets may fly by and drop bombs; the jets and bombs may be shot as well.

The player earns points by shooting helicopters, paratroopers, jets, and bombs. Firing a shell costs the player one point, so if one is playing for score, there is an incentive to conserve ammo.

The game ends when the player's turret is hit by a bomb, when a single paratrooper lands directly on the turret, or when four paratroopers safely land on either the left or right of the turret (that is four on one side, not four total). Once this happens, they are able to build a human pyramid and climb up to the turret and blow it up.</desc>

		<name>Santa Paravia And Fiumaccio</name>
		<desc>An intermediary step in complexity between the brutally basic HAMURABI and more sophisticated modern titles such as Civilization, Santa Paravia and Fiumaccio ushers you into a Merchant Prince setting, governing over a 15th-century Italian city-state, competing with the savage forces of nature and against up to 5 (7 in some later versions) other players in the hot-seat, seeing who can rise through the ranks to claim titles from COUNT, to MARQUIS, GRAND DUKE (and, finally, H.R.H. KING).

At its heart the game is, as are its predecessors, about bean-counting -- weighing your current reserves of grain (measured in steres) against your population's food demands, wondering how many gold florins the market price for your surplus will net, and how many hectares of land that'll permit you to purchase... and whether that investment will come back to haunt you the following turn if the weather shifts from feast to famine, when you have plenty of dirt and nothing growing in it to feed your grumbling populace.  However, the game cleans up real nice, and cute graphical depictions may help you to forget that your debauched Renaissance rule largely consists of moving debits and credits back and forth across a virtual ledger.

Varying difficulty levels help you find your own comfort zone in which to engage bad harvest conditions, worse real-estate prices and, worst of all, the endless appetites of what must amount to hundreds of thousands of rats, endlessly nibbling at your reserves.  Surplus capital can be sunk into blue-chip investments such as marketplaces and mills, palaces, cathedrals and private armies.  If, after commissioning them all, you find you don't have so much surplus capital after all, you can always cook the books by adjusting several different flavours of taxes, tariffs and customs fees... but tamper too much and your local economy will be stifled!

Nearly every downturn in this game has an equal and opposite check, or at least a balance, to keep it from demolishing your estate in a single swoop... however, early versions of this game, as with many titles of its era, may cruelly and arbitrarily cut your rule short with a random death.  All the more reason to carpe diem and do the best with what you've got, while you've got it.</desc>

		<path>./Saracen (1987)(Datasoft)[cr].dsk</path>
		<name>Saracen</name>
		<desc>A combination puzzle/action game from Datasoft.  In each of the 100 levels, the player moves a crusader through an obstacle filled maze trying to reach the Saracen Chief and detonate a bomb next to him.  The chief does not move, instead remaining in a set position.

Along the way, he must avoid roaming guards, bouncing cannonballs, and other traps.  The crusader is armed with a bow and can pick up directionally specific arrows that are used to stop guards or destroy walls. The arrows being limited to shooting in one of the four compass directions is exacerbated by only being able to carry one object (key, arrow or bomb) at a time. For these reasons, the game's puzzle leanings and the need for a methodical approach are strong.

There is generally only one way to solve each level and proper use of the given tools is key to finding it.</desc>

		<name>Shanghai</name>
		<desc>Shanghai is one of the first video game adaptations of the tile-based game played with the Chinese mahjong stones - essentially a puzzle game that has little to do with real mahjong rules.

The gameplay involves 144 tiles, each depicting different images, which have to be removed by matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the centre. A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side.

This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on and features five preset challenges, some of which have time limits of five or ten minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.</desc>

Take one of the "fleet boats" and go on extended patrols of up to 2 months from Hawaii, Australia, or New Zealand. Set your difficulty/realism level and time period (early means less tech for juicier targets, later means tougher escorts, more tech, lousier targets). Contend with factors like dud torpedoes, maximum depth, and more. 

You can choose among practice run against some old hulks, recreate historical convoy attacks, go on a single patrol, or go on your own campaign, which lets you go multiple patrols until you die, get promoted, or survive the war.

		<desc>Six-Gun Shootout is a turn-based strategy game of man-to-man combat, using the setting of the American West in the 19th century. It offers ten scenarios which can be played against the computer or a human opponent. The scenarios are loosely based on historical situations, like the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, or entirely fictional. Some are based on movies, for example the 1959 released "Rio Bravo".</desc>

		<name>Sky Destroyer</name>
		<desc>Sky Destroyer is an aerial combat game. Players take the role of a warplane that has to defeat various enemy combatants in the air and in the sea. The player's warplane is equipped with machine guns and can also fire off torpedoes. The main goal is to destroy a fortified island at the end of each scene by firing a torpedo at it.

Gameplay is viewed from a behind the plane viewpoint. While flying. players will notice time elapses by the background changing from day to night and then back to day again. The is to help indicate to the player that they are making progress throughout the level. When the player cycles to the next daytime sequence, the player will be able to know a island should be coming up soon. After taking out the fortified island, players will get a chance to play a bonus stage where the objective is for the player to destroy as many planes of an incoming enemy fleet as possible, with each destroyed plane adding to the player's score. Managing to destroy every single plane in this bonus round will also give the player additional bonus points to add to their overall score.

The player starts with three lives and can lose them by either getting hit by incoming enemy fire or crashing into the water that is below them.</desc>

		<name>Solo Flight</name>
		<desc>A simulation that has you flying Mail runs from many different airports in one of three states of America which are Kansas, Colorado and Washington (choosing Washington does allow you to fly in neighbouring state Oregon as well). For a game that arrived some 24 years ago now, it still manages to feature an impressive amount of remarkable details for the time, such as VOR towers readings, DME, ILS, and coupled with the game aspect that is to deliver post,  Solo Flight is clearly quite unlike what you will have played before.

Score for choices made meaning you must ponder certain things like how much fuel you might need for each delivery. Each mail delivered is to a different airport but the option is also there to carry several loads, each an additional weight that needs to be taken into account. Having a heavier payload means burning more fuel and a difference to how the plane handles, but potentially a higher score can result. It's this design that makes Solo Flight so intensely fun each time.

Various weather conditions such as clear, nightime, light cloud and even a heavy cloud that requires IFR skills. It's entirely possible to fly using just instruments in total cloud blindness up until the point you pop out of a cloud to see the runway hopefully as you had planned. Indeed an accurately planned route using both VORS can have yourself precisely lined up and ready for a final descent using ILS.  

You really do need the maps though and attempting Solo Flight without them is fairly pointless - playing this seriously requires maps for VOR plotting.</desc>

Very soon, however, the hero notices that something strange has been happening to the master. He frequently talks to himself and seems to be under some sort of a malevolent influence - until one day, he is mysteriously kidnapped. Looks like the brave Enchanter must venture on a perilous journey once again, and bring back the leader of the Circle.

Sorcerer is a sequel to Enchanter, and is part of the Zork universe. Like its predecessors, it is a text adventure, in which the player interacts with the game world by typing combinations of verbs and objects. The spell system from the previous game is back; a new feature is the protagonist's ability to drink magical potions, which must be done sometimes in order to solve the game's puzzles.</desc>

		<name>Space Shuttle</name>
		<desc>Space Shuttle is a simulation game where you are the pilot of the space shuttle Discovery. Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first-person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttle's engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used. In addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (auto simulator and simulator mode) are included. The auto simulator mode is the easiest; the computer will control the flight (you can take over at any point you wish) and the controls are simplified. The simulation mode is closer to the full game, however, you have an unlimited amount of fuel so there is no time pressure, and the computer will help compensate for inaccurate maneuvering.</desc>

		<desc>In Spare Change, you are the owner and operator of the Spare Change Arcade, dedicated to making your place of business run as smoothly as possible. Inside the arcade are Token machines, jukeboxes, telephones, movie booths, popcorn machines, and so on. The token machines need to be restocked with money from the cash register when they are out of tokens, but eventually, the register must be replenished with cash from the safe. You must drop the tokens in one of your two storage bins. When you have stored at least ten tokens, the movie booth opens, and you can go inside to proceed to the next level. You are also awarded one bag of money, but if you store more than ten tokens, then more than one bag of money is awarded for each extra token collected. If nine bags of money are obtained, you proceed to the next level.

But the Zerks, two aliens that run around the screen, can steal tokens either from the machines or from the storage bins. Sometimes, a Zerk will toss a token to the other nearest the "piggy bank". You must touch them in order to get the token back, before they throw it in their piggy bank.  Alternatively, you can throw a token into the jukebox, telephone, popcorn machine, etc. and the Zerks will get distracted from their goal, giving you enough time to continue filling the storage bins. If the Zerks insert five tokens in the piggy bank, the game is over.

Between levels, an intermission plays, which are similar to those in Pac-Man. Later in the game, you have the ability to access these intermissions. As you proceed through the levels, the game gets quite difficult.</desc>

		<path>./Spectre (1982)(Datamost)[cr].dsk</path>
		<name>Spectre</name>
		<desc>Spectre is a 3D shooter where the player drives a little red car/tank and blasts away enemies.  The gameplay is similar to Battlezone, and obviously inspired by it.

There is a selection of three tanks, each with three values (speed; armor; and firepower) balanced out to match its name: Tough Guy is heavy on armor, but slow and not very powerful; Speedy is fast, but low armor; and Balanced combines both strengths, but decreased. A fourth tank allows the player to design a custom variant.

Every level consists of a large plane filled with enemy tanks, several psychedelic walls with odd images that often flicker or warp resembling an acid trip, and tacky 3D models like windmills.  The object of each level is to either destroy all the enemy tanks in the level, or to collect all the flags. Every level has a certain theme to it, anything from plain green to a colorful blinking eye or images of sand dunes are to be found on the walls, windmills and flags throughout the level.

With every passing level, enemy tanks grow smarter and their rates of fire increases.  Also in later levels, new, smarter, more powerful enemy tanks join the skirmish. The player has a limited amount of ammo, but driving over ammo deposits replenishes a small amount of ammunition, as well as driving over shield deposits grants additional shields. The three different views (first, third, and top-down) allow the player to incorporate additional strategies into the battles.

The game boasts having supposedly an infinite amount of levels, though anything after level 80 is almost instant death.  A high score table is also included.

An additional note-worthy feature of this game is the multi-player mode. Up to eight players are supported over IPX, or NetBios (or two via modem or serial port). The network option offers three Cyberspace Scenarios: Arena - free-for-all battles, get one point for each opponent destroyed.Flag Rally - a match point given for collecting six flags, destroy someone to get any flags being carried.Base Raid - Akin to "capture the flag".  Two teams, two bases; get match point for destroying opponent base.The CD-ROM manual includes a "Cyberpunk story", to give background information on the game which consisted of a cyberjock named Hart who lived for the battles in the Arena.</desc>

		<name>Spellbreaker</name>
		<desc>The head of the Circle of Enchanters is a brave hero, the same one who has defeated the evil Krill and solved the mystery of the Necromancer Belboz. However, now an even greater threat has appeared: the very foundations of the art of Magic seem to be failing! The Guilds organize a great assembly to discuss the alarming waning of Magic; suddenly, a mysterious shadowy figure casts a spell that transforms everyone to toads and newts - everyone but the intrepid leader of the Circle, who must commit his most heroic deeds yet, solving the hardest mystery of all.

The concluding part of the Enchanter trilogy within the Zork universe, Spellbreaker is a sequel to Sorcerer. The game plays similarly to its predecessors, the player inputting text commands to interact with the game world and solve puzzles. The magic system is still present; however, spellcasting can fail now, due to the game's premise of the decline of magic. A new feature is the player's ability to name the objects the protagonist collects in the game. This ability becomes a necessity when the player is required to collect the identically-looking Cubes of Foundation, having to name them in order to differentiate between them.</desc>

The game is viewed isometrically, which means that the controls are rotated through 90 degrees - this, coupled with the fact that many screens have huge gaps and diagonal paths, means that it's hard to get far at first. Falling off ledges loses you time, which is very limited to start with

Gerald must collect energy crystals throughout his journey - which can also be shortened by using a complex system of lifts. Sections you have travelled through are automatically mapped.</desc>

		<desc>Originating in the arcades, Spy Hunter is a driving action game played from an overhead point of view. Your car is equipped with machine guns to help you get past the numerous enemies out on the road (be careful not to shoot any civilians, though!) Occasionally you will come across a weapons van, and if you drive into the back of the van your car becomes equipped with a second weapon (such as smoke screen, oil slick, or missiles). At several points the road splits and you can enter a boathouse which transforms your car into a boat temporarily. If you drive far enough the seasons change as well (watch out for icy conditions during winter!). The enemy cars will do anything to stop you, including running you off the road, firing guns from the back of a limo, or dropping bombs from a helicopter.</desc>

		<desc>MAD magazine?s comic strip of the same name comes to life in this game which was designed for one or two players. The split-screen shows both spies at the same time. Play with a friend or against the machine.

The black spy and the white spy are out to outsmart each other before the time bell rings. Find the needed objects (money, passport, secret plans and airport door key) by searching rooms in the embassy, which include desks, file cabinets and other furniture. Foil your opponent by setting creative booby traps in the various rooms (a bomb in a dresser drawer, for instance).  Traps can be disarmed with objects found in rooms (a water bucket from a firebox on the wall will disarm the bomb in the prior example).  When all the items are together in the secret briefcase, head for the airport door.

Fights ensue when both spies enter the same room and are armed with clubs.</desc>

		<desc>Star Wars is a first-person shooter based around the final scenes of the original Star Wars film. It first appeared for arcade coin-operated machines and was subsequently converted to other gaming platforms.

You take on the role of Luke Skywalker, aiming to destroy the Death Star. In the first phase you have to pass swarms of TIE Fighters, including dogfighting the one piloted by Darth Vader himself. In the second phase the station's surface is protected by laser towers, third involves attacking its weakest spot - the unprotected exhaust port - with proton torpedos. Your X-Wing starts with six shields, but more can be awarded for good performance. Complete the game and it loops back around at ever-increasing difficulty.

The game uses vector graphics, which allow lots of action at high speed on comparatively slow systems.</desc>

		<desc>In the distant future, a small group of human exiles have been doomed to fight for survival on the edge of the galaxy.  Through military strength, espionage, and deceit, a unified Terran government has maintained an uneasy peace.  But a previously unknown species, the Zerg, has started overrunning their colonies.  Furthermore, a second alien species, the enigmatic Protoss, became intent on stopping the Zerg.  The Protoss solution, however, is to extinguish all life on Zerg-infested planets, including many surviving resident Terrans.  At the same time, rebel factions within the Terran government are gaining popular support during the Zerg crisis.  The time for war has come!

Gameplay in StarCraft has clear similarities to Blizzard's earlier WarCraft II.  Building units requires credits and a power source, and once completed you can direct them into combat against foes.  You only know the layout of terrain you have visited, and only the exact whereabouts of enemy units which are range for one of your units, due to the Fog of War. 

Each of the three races has a distinct range of units and general strengths: Zerg units are quick to build, Terran units cost the least, and Protoss units are the most powerful individually.  In a change from many strategy games, the base style for each race also varies significantly, resulting in a very different playing experience with each.  Missions vary from destruction to infiltration.  Realistic line-of-sight calculations make the correct result more likely.  A full map editor is provided, with many user-created maps available online.</desc>

		<desc>The year is 2186. Humanity has established colonies on the moon, Mars, and several of the larger asteroids. Earth's sky is dotted with space habitats, and the spaceways are always busy. As usual, there is the urgent need for energy to power this advanced civilization; one of the primary sources of that energy is quantum black holes.

In Starcross, you are a miner of black holes, scouring the asteroid belt in your one-man survey ship. Finding and harnessing a single black hole can make a person's fortune. It's a lonely business, fraught with the known and unknown hazards of space. You've equipped your ship, the M.C.S. STARCROSS, with the best gear you could afford. You've put everything into this venture, and though you've tried before, you somehow sense that this time will be different.

The ship's computer handles the functions of navigation and routine maintenance. You watch the sophisticated mass detector as it unceasingly scans the vicinity for uncharted masses. To assuage the tedium of your long trip, you browse through the compact tape library, a compendium of human knowledge and culture. But the drone of the ship gradually lulls you into a deep sleep.

As you sleep, you dream of the riches which would be yours if your search for a quantum black hole is successful. Little do you suspect that the alarm on your mass detector is about to jolt you out of your dream - but not to grapple with the long-sought black hole. Your quest has taken an unexpected turn, for you are destined to rendezvous with a gargantuan alien spaceship from the outer fringes of the galaxy.</desc>

		<name>Starglider</name>
		<desc>The Planet Novenia has been attacked by the Egrons, who snuck in by disguising their craft as the protected Starglider species, which Novenia's automated defenses were programmed not to shoot. 

Your task is to fight them off using only an obsolete Airborne Ground Attack Vehicle. This was designed as the ultimate combat machine, with sophisticated hardware up to Draziw Yarg's high standards. It has a fully-rechargeable shield, plasma drive unit, an inbuilt scanner and 10,000-sector map, a top speed of 2550 Urads and two homing missiles.

The game is viewed from within AGAV's cockpit, with control over speed, weapon targeting and firing. There are several control options to decide exactly how the craft works, with fixed or floating sighting, and the option of automatic centering, allowing you to balance the game between easy sighting and advanced shooting ranges.

Repair depots must be visited frequently, as they can refill the weapon bays as well as repairing the ship. Crucially, the Egron Stargliders need 3 missiles to shoot down, so at least 1 visit to a depot is required to complete this job, at which point you move up to the next, harder, level.</desc>

		<name>Stellar 7</name>
		<desc>In Stellar 7, a remake of the 1983 game, you drive the Raven, the most advanced Terran fighting vehicle. You are up against Gir Draxon and his evil Arcturan army. You will go from star system to star system, fighting his forces. When the enemies have been destroyed, a mothership flies overhead and beams down the Guardian of the star system, a giant enemy ship. When you reach the Arcturus star system, you will fight Gir Draxon!

The game is played from a first person view looking out from the cockpit of the Raven. It is in true polygonal 3D. Aside from a graphical and aural overhaul and the addition of cutscenes, the remake's gameplay and level design is virtually identical to the original, right down to the placement of each and every enemy. The major differences are the added "power modules" (e.g. supercannon, superjump) and a major boss creature at the end of every level.</desc>

		<name>Sub Mission</name>
		<desc>An evil alien warlord has kidnapped two Earthlings, Peter and Sigourney. He agrees to free them only on one condition: somebody must defeat him in a dangerous game that consists of piloting submarines with a remote control. Who is brave enough to stand up to this challenge? And who can assume this grave responsibility - since the destruction of the submarine leads to the death of the two humans?...

Sub Mission incorporates elements of a submarine simulation and action. The player must preserve the submarine intact, find the two kidnapped humans, and safely bring them home. It is possible to assign robots as the submarine crew; their destruction won't automatically end the game. However, should the player fail, e.g. have his/her submarine destroyed, Peter and Sigourney will die. The game actually erases these characters from the disk, with only one chance at resurrection; should the player fail this chance as well, the game will be over permanently, i.e. it will be impossible to play again.</desc>

With 8 difficulty settings there is a lot of the game to master as you must start to keep an eye on your fuel, torpedoes, radar, and enemy while avoiding depth charges as the difficulty rises.  You can fire up to two torpedoes at a time. While enemy shows go by your periscope sink as many as you can.  The periscope can turn 360 degrees and look off into the horizon or close to your sub.  Some ships move slower than others, and one of the ships moves so fast that the only way to hit it is by tracking it by radar instead of visually.</desc>

		<desc>A simple action game where the player is a rabbit who must cross the screen initially from left to right avoiding the various nasty critters in their way.

When the player reaches the right hand side of the screen their goal is to claim the carrot that is being dangled in front of them. If they get the carrot they are transformed into Super Bunny and must begin their journey back across the screen. In this super powered form the player can take revenge and defeat the critters standing in their way.

Super Bunny is similar to "cross the road" games such as the arcade game Frogger and Activision's Freeway.

The original box came with a complete "Super Bunny" comic book written and illustrated by air-brush artist Martin Cannon, staff artist at Datamost.</desc>

		<desc>A maze top-down dungeon crawl computer game for the Apple ][.  In "Super Quest", your objective is to penetrate the maze of Saladin and activate the fabulous Mega Crown, the one device that might restore the balance of technology and magic. The maze has more than one-thousand chambers and corridors arranged in four large sections or "levels". Throughout the labyrinth are treasure chests containing gold, jewels, and other valuable items as well as weapons, vials of healing elixir, and a magic lamp.  Some chests, however, are full of junk or even empty. Monsters guard the treasures to guarantee that only a hero of tested mettle reaches the Mega Crown.

There is only one known entrance, through an underground passage to the middle of the first level. The Mega Crown is said to reside somewhere in the fourth level. Just outside the maze is a bazaar and inside it are two hospices (the latter are maintained by

The hero can be one of four races: Human, Hobbit, Dwarf, or Elf.</desc>

		<path>./Super Zaxxon (19xx)(Sega)[cr].dsk</path>
		<name>Super Zaxxon</name>
		<desc>Super Zaxxon is a three-quarter perspective, space shooter style game. You must first go over a base on an asteroid. Things located on this base include gun implacements, fuel tanks, radar stations, missiles, and fighters. After you successfully navigate this base, you will go through a tunnel to tangle with enemy fighters, mine layers, and mines. You then will have to navigate through a series of barriers on another asteroid in order to take on the Super Zaxxon's, the enemy robot dragons.

The game is very similar in appearance to Zaxxon.  The differences are:Your fighter moves much faster. This makes going after ground targets a big challenge.

The graphics are different. Although this is more of a viewing difference, it can still change ones perspective after they have gotten used to the Zaxxon graphics.

There is no more outer space battle. Instead, you must go through a narrow tunnel to get to area 3.

Instead of 20 fighters, you now have to tangle with 25 fighters in area 2.

A new enemy, the Mine Layer, is introduced. As the name implies, this ship lays mines in your path. You can destroy the mines but it takes a few hits.

Instead of encountering one Zaxxon robot, you now have to deal with three Super Zaxxon, dragon looking robots.

The placement of things (fuel tanks, gun implacements, etc.) in areas 1 and 3 is different then in Zaxxon.

There are now indestructible, elevated guns in area 1. These guns sit on the right side and they are 2.5 units in altitude.</desc>

		<name>Suspended</name>
		<desc>On a space settlement named Contra, a human being serves as a regulator for the planet's vital systems: he controls transportation, weather, and manages resources all while being in a deep sleep, through the neural power of his brain. Such a regulator is called Central Mentality. However, after five hundred years of stasis, the current Central Mentality suddenly awakens, greatly troubled by reports of computer malfunctioning and resulting problems in weather condition, food production, and transport. He must now act, and act quickly: the crew members assumed that he has gone insane, and are coming to disconnect his mind. But what can he do if his state of suspended animation prevents him from moving?

Suspended is a text adventure game with a twist: instead of navigating the protagonist, the player indirectly controls six robots that do his bidding, exploring the environment and interacting with it. Each robot has different functions and has its own way of seeing reality and reacting to events around it. Iris is the only robot that can see and therefore visually describe locations and objects; Whiz can provide technical information obtained from computers; the sonar-powered Waldo is good at holding items; Auda is an expert in sounds; the cryptically speaking Poet senses the flow of electric currents; finally, Sensa can detect magnetic and photon emissions. The player advances in the game by using the different abilities of the robots and solving puzzles.</desc>

		<name>Swiss Family Robinson</name>
		<desc>Swiss Family Robinson is a computer game based on the 1812 novel by Johann David Wyss. Players take the role of Fritz, the eldest brother of a Swiss family that has been shipwrecked in the oceans of the East Indies en route to Port Jackson, Australia.  

As the game begins, it is your goal to find a way off of the ship, onto the deserted island, and build a shelter to survive.  Numerous challenges await Fritz as he has to defend against tropical storms, hostile animals, and the mischievous antics of his youngest brother Francis, which can sometimes hinder the player's progress.

Swiss Family Robinson is a classic-style text adventure game, using basic word commands and phrases to talk to your family, take action, or accomplish goals.  As with most games of the the time, you have to explore the details of the scenery in order to find clues and items that will aid your survival.

There are some "help" features in the game to give a player additional info. such as a "Help" key, a mapping/navigation system, and an actual "Guide to Nature" book that contains detailed information on island flora and fauna, as well as basic survival skills.</desc>

		<path>./Swordthrust (1981)(Donald Brown).dsk</path>
		<name>Swordthrust</name>
		<desc>SwordThrust is a commercialized and enhanced version of the Eamon RPG. Your hero begins in the land of Diurla at the Main Hall, where he (or she) must register, roll up stats, equip, and buy spells before going on one of many adventures.  

Like in its predecessor, your main stats are Hardiness (the number of hits you can take before you die and your carrying capacity), Agility (affects your chance to hit monsters), and Charisma (affects prices at the Main Hall and the friendliness of monsters). SwordThrust also adds  another ability called Left Hand, which affects your chance of hitting with weapons in your left hand. All the standard weapon categories (Axe, Bow, Club, Spear, Sword) are inherited from Eamon and work in similar ways. Your weapon score is a percentage chance for you to hit with that type of weapon, and it has a small chance of going up each time you hit. 

SwordThrust adds many new spells to the standard Eamon spellbook of Blast, Power, Heal, and Speed.  Some examples of the new spells are: Charm (makes monsters friendlier towards you), Fear (makes monsters run away), Thickskin (increases your armor), This greatly expands your options in the game as well as giving you something to spend your extra gold on since the most powerful spells can cost 30000 or more gold pieces.

Adventuring is very similar to Eamon. The dungeons are all text-based, similar to an adventure game. You move and fight through the dungeons with commands like NORTH, INVENTORY, ATTACK RAT, and so on.  Some improvements over the Eamon interface are that the room description and character status are displayed in a window at the top of the screen so you don't have to constantly be LOOKing to figure out where you are. Another gameplay change is that your character can get fatigued.  When your fatigue gets too high, you pass out which may end up killing you if monsters find you. Stopping and RESTing is necessary, but it is easy to get very fatigued in a difficult battle and pass out when you have to run away to rest.

Equipping items is also much different than in Eamon. You can now equip weapons in your left hand if you don't use a shield, potentially doubling your number of attacks. Armor is also now equippable, so it is possible to find better armor during your adventures instead of being stuck with what you bought at the Main Hall. 

SwordThrust had several adventures written for it, including The King's Testing Ground, a beginner's adventure that came with the game.   Other adventures included:The Vampyre CavesThe Kidnappers CoveThe Case of the Sultan's PearlThe Green PlagueThe Eternal Curse, andThe Hall of Alchemie</desc>

		<path>./Taipan (1982)(Avalanche).dsk</path>
		<name>Taipan</name>
		<desc>Loosely based on Clavell's Taipan, this game is a trading simulation set in the Far East during the 1800s. The player is based out of Hong Kong and has a single trading ship with which he can transport one of four cargoes from place to place. There are different cargoes to be traded, from the cheaper general goods to the more expensive arms and silks, culminating in the opportunity to trade in the illegal opium trade.

     Generally, the strategy here was buy low, sell high. To add some tension to the game, there is a random chance that you will encounter several obstacles to your trading empire. Random pirates, pickpockets, and thieves who rob you and your warehouse are all out there for their own benefit (and your detriment!) Li Yuen acts as the local mafia boss, extorting increasing sums of money for his "protection". Local authorities will seize your opium and fine you if you're caught, ruining an otherwise successful voyage. Local market conditions can render a price extremely high or low, giving you a chance to make a quick buck.

     You have the option to trade up to a larger ship as time goes buy, as well as outfit your current ship with guns. However, beware! The larger the ship, the more pirate ships it attracts! Also, the larger ships are more expensive to repair. 

     You can play as long as you want--you're given the opportunity to retire once you reach one million. You're given a score at the end of the game based on your net worth, your ship size, and a few other factors.     

     All in all, this is a pretty decent trading simulation, even if the monochrome graphics left something to be desired. Although some parents may want to avoid a game with opium in it, overall it's great for teaching basic economic concepts to kids.</desc>

		<desc>Tapper is an action game where you're a beer tapper (barman) and have to serve beer to demanding customers. There are four customers, each has its own lane lengthier than the previous one, whom you have to keep at bay. If they reach the end of the lane without receiving their beer, you're a goner; if you miss one and accidentally spill beer needlessly you lose a life and should one of them throw you back the mug and you fail to catch it, you lose a life as well.

Occasionally a bizarre icon will appear on one of the lines and, should you grab it, will invoke a "cabarette"-style show which will keep some of the customers occupied.

The Xbox 360 version includes bonus rounds, as well as co-op and versus multiplayer modes, also online, along with achievements.</desc>

		<path>./Tarturian (19xx)(-).dsk</path>
		<name>Tarturian</name>
		<desc>Tarturian was a follow up to  Highlands Computer Service's first game, Oldorf's Revenge. It was largely an expansion of the ideas introduced in Oldorf's Revenge.  This was a very early hi-res vector graphics and text adventure game of the same era and style as Mystery House.  Intriguingly, Tarturian, like Oldorf's Revenge,  allowed you to choose to switch between various types of characters, such as the Wizard, Thief, Strongman, Elf, etc.  The game has two mechanics limiting the number of times you can "change" into each character, which layered on an element of resource management that was unique for an adventure game of its day.  Each of these characters allowed certain specialized text parser commands.  For example, only the Wizard can "cast" (a spell) while only the Thief can "unlock", "pick", "open", etc.  This list of text commands is only knowable if you have the instruction manual for the game.  This also allows for multiple solutions to the same puzzle.  For example, the initial door can be unlocked by the Thief, or blasted off it's hinges if the Wizard casts a spell.  This is very much unlike more popular games of the era like Mystery House, which allowed for only one solution to each puzzle.  

Additionally, the manual provided other info about how to play that is essential knowledge for gameplay. (Unlike the modern gaming era, in 1980 it was expected that players would read everything provided with a game.) 

From that point on, Tarturian becomes a graphics + text adventure game, with some interesting elements not commonly found in more standard examples of the era.  For example, the game introduces randomized monster encounters that can instantly kill the character you're playing as, forcing you to switch to another character to proceed.

The game finishes with what is one of the very first "boss monsters" found in computer gaming, with a very satisfying animated conclusion.</desc>

Due to unusual solar conditions, Farside is cut off from the rest of the galaxy. Now it falls to the planet's inhabitants, and the insurrectionist leader Benthi, to finish Tawala once and for all.

The player takes control of Benthi and commands her forces and agents. The ultimate goal is to attack and take Tawala's redoubt, located at the other end of the map from Benthi's camp. Resources at the beginning are meager, though: Benthi only has 100 credits, 100 troops and 15 weapons at her disposal. She must gather the resources of Farside's various chiefs to stand a real chance. Communication with the chiefs (or any friendlies not in Benthi's camp) is done by sending messengers. The chiefs can be asked for money, troops or arms, and be given money as an incentive. The messengers can be asked to threaten reprisals in the case a chief refuses a request - not acting on such a threat might damage Benthi's reputation with all of Farside's chiefs, though.

How a chief deals with an offer can be deduced from personality dossiers provided by Benthi's chief of intelligence, Paoli. Paoli also is responsible for sending out spies. They can be sent to any village on the map and will report on any movement of Tawala's troops. It is also possible to send them into the redoubt itself. Risk of capture is high, and an agent cannot be recalled from the redoubt, but he will give a full report on Tawala's overall strength. Next to troop strength and movements, agents will also provide additional information, like the locations of a hidden arms cache or the lair of independent war chief Vyl-ourmani, as well as the passwords needed to access those locations.

Regarding troops there are two options: they can be sent to only secure a town, meaning they only fight if Tawala's forces are present. In the case of uncooperative chiefs, they can also be sent to loot &amp; pillage, in which case they attack the local militia, and, if successful, secure any loot they might find. 

Should Benthi's camp come under threat (as indicated by agents' reports), it can be moved. If Benthi is still present when Tawala's forces attack, the game is over. It is necessary to move the camp in any case, because the redoubt can only be attacked when Benthi has gathered her forces in the town closest to it.</desc>

		<name>Taxman</name>
		<desc>Taxman is a pretty accurate clone of the arcade smash hit Pac-Man where the player takes the role of the "Taxman" and has to collect tax from the rebellious citizens.

You control the now famous circular dot muncher that has to go around the maze and collect all the "tax pellets".  He is chased by four ghosts that will kill the poor taxman on touch. If the Taxman eats a power pellet, the roles are reversed and he can chase the ghosts and eat them in return. Levels repeat with increased difficulty and once three lives are lost, it is Game Over.</desc>

		<desc>Unlike the original Tetris, Tetris 2 has you clearing the field of blocks in a different way. Each play field starts with different colored dots (in this case black, gray and white), with one of each color flashing. The blocks are made up of the same three colors, and by matching blocks of the same color over the top or to the side of the dot will clear the dot and those blocks from the screen. If you clear a flashing dot, all the corresponding dots of the same color will be cleared. To complete the round just clear the dots, not the blocks themselves.</desc>

		<name>Tharolian Tunnels</name>
		<desc>Tharolian Tunnels is an action game that contains five parts with varying gameplay. The player's task is to enter the planet Tharolia through a tunnel and reach the centre of it where its defense systems has to be destroyed. On the way to the centre the player has to avoid getting killed by the defenses and avoid crashing into the tunnel walls or running out of fuel.

The game starts out in space with the first part being a shoot 'em up similar to Space Invaders where the player has to clear out two rows of enemy ships that move back and forth across the screen. Once it has been completed the player enters the planet and has to navigate a space craft through a small tunnel that scrolls from top to bottom while not crashing. It's possible to use guns to destroy walls but it will lead to fuel being depleted. In the third part the tunnels widens but here there are torpedoes launched from above and fighters that have to be either blasted or avoided. It is followed by an automatic sequence where the ship is refuelled. The final part of the game involves navigating through lasers and land into a docking compartment. Here thrust controls are used and it's necessary to land with minimum speed to avoid crashing.</desc>

		<desc>This game covers the first 30 days of what was then feared to be the next war in Europe. You can choose to be the supreme commander of the NATO or the Warsaw Pact. In your control are air and ground units. These are backed up by your ability to make strategic nuclear/chemical attacks.

As the Warsaw Pact commander your task is to break the lines of the NATO alliance, which you see is a powerful invasion force, poised on your border. Your first task is to take over West Germany.

As NATO commander your task is to stop the Russian invasion. Hold the lines on West Germany's border. You will achieve this by preventing the occupation of West Germany.

Your computer opponent can play in three different ways. Nuclear weapons can be disabled for a Beginner game, while the thought processes can be either rational or unpredictable.

Gameplay is turn-based and primarily strategic, but some scenes can be played out in optional action sequences.</desc>

		<path>./Theseus And The Minotaur (1982)(TSR).dsk</path>
		<name>Theseus And the Minotaur</name>
		<desc>This is one of the earliest electronic adaptation of the Theseus and the Minotaur pencil-and-paper maze puzzle by Robert Abbott, based on the concept of logic mazes where certain limitations in movement apply.

The game consists of ten mazes to solve, designed by the original author as well as Toby Nelson. Players need to guide Theseus (represented by a red circle) towards the exit of the maze, while avoiding the minotaur (represented by a black circle). The goal of each level is to reach the exit, but this cannot be done by travelling towards it directly. Theseus is only able to move one tile at at time, while the minotaur can do two. To reach the exit, Theseus has to outsmart the minotaur by luring him into a specific position, exploiting the internal movement logic. The minotaur will not chase after Theseus directly, but approaches him based on rules of vertical and horizontal movement. For instance, when Theseus is on the same horizontal line as the minotaur, but with a wall between them, he is able to move left and right as much as he wants without having the minotaur move. At certain moments it is also needed to delay an action or skip the turn, to lure the minotaur into a certain path without moving Theseus.

The game is entirely controlled by the keyboard for movement. Other keys are used to reset the maze, move on to the previous or the next one, and delay a turn (sometimes needed to lure the minotaur into a specific direction). The basic graphical design of the game went through different stages over the years.</desc>

		<desc>Threshold is a simple shoot'em up game. You are in control of a spaceship at the bottom of the screen and have to shoot several formations of enemies at the top of the screen.

To make things more difficult you have limited time in form of a fuel tank which will get refilled after you cleared a number of waves. Besides that, your spacecraft is equipped with a laser that tends to overheat. Every shot makes the heat bar of the laser increase a bit. Once it reached its maximum you can't fire anymore and are forced to wait until it cools down while slowly running out of fuel.</desc>

		<name>Titan Empire</name>
		<desc>Your ship has photon torpedoes and a warp drive, it "beams" stuff up and down, it's shaped like a saucer with two protruding nacelles... yeah, you guessed it - it's another space combat/strategy game which has nothing to do with Star Trek at all!  Rather, it takes place in the solar system, which is on the verge of being conquered by the forces of Titan.  The oily Saturnian moon is home to an evil expansionist regime, which has already annexed a few planetary bodies, and is hellbent on capturing them all.

The remaining free worlds have chosen you to lead the resistance.  Your task - defend friendly planets and moons, crush the Titan fleets and retake the lost colonies.

You may travel freely throughout the continuous game world, and between its planets and moons, each of which is a potential ally or foe.  Everything is carried out in real time; a radar screen, a map and a planetary info sheet help keep track of the proceedings. Even the positions of planets and moons are continuously updated as they creep along on their orbits.

Conquest is accomplished by transporting armies from friendly locations down to enemy worlds; you'll have to take into account planetary defenses, refuel and repair at friendly bases as needed, and directly engage hostile spacecraft using your shields, torpedoes and tracking missiles. Meanwhile, enemy forces will attempt conquests of their own, and your presence will often be required for defense.  Should your ship be lost in battle, it will respawn at the nearest friendly planet, but any personnel it might have carried is lost forever.

For each new game, you may choose to use the same solar system from your previous session, or start with a new randomized configuration.</desc>

		<name>Tomahawk</name>
		<desc>Flight simulation specialists Digital Integration turned their attention to helicopter flight in this recreation of the AH-64 Apache. All the controls are realistically simulated, so the airspeed is dependent on the height of the vehicle, and you can move horizontally using the rudder option as well as rolling left and right. If using a Sinclair joystick interface you can use both ports to have all these controls accessible on dual joysticks, just like the real thing. Either way, a full instrument panel allows monitoring of these.

You are armed with cannons, rockets and anti-tank missiles, each of which has its target set up independently, but only one can be loaded at once. Flight options include day/night, clear/cloudy and air turbulence on/off, allowing beginners and experts to find a suitable setting. Scenery includes trees, mountains and pylons, while enemy targets include helicopters, turrets and tanks.</desc>

		<desc>Torpedo Fire is a turn-based tactical game of WW2 naval warfare focused on submarine vs. destroyer combat. The player may take the role of either a submarine commander or a destroyer captain in any side of the conflict, while at the same time send orders to other ships in the player's command. The game allows playing against a fellow player (hot-seat multiplayer) or the computer AI in turns that simulate 60 minutes of actual combat.

The game features different interfaces for the sub and destroyer players (a periscope interface for the sub and a radar/sonar screen for the destroyer) and comes with a single introductory mission to hone your skills. The game nonetheless includes a hefty database of ships and weapons which can be put to use in the included SSI Shipyard program that allows the player to design campaigns and scenarios.</desc>

There are arrows the player can drive over which make the track behind them change for their opponent (obstacles popping up for example), therefore making it harder for a driver to catch up.</desc>

		<name>Trolls and Tribulations</name>
		<desc>You play a troll set on an expedition into cavernous sewers to retrieve valuable relics. Guarding the treasure are monsters such as cretins, buzzards, skulls and spiders. The mazes are difficult to navigate and fraught with danger. One wrong move could send you plummeting to your death.

Trolls and Tribulations is a side scrolling platform game with some puzzle like mechanics due to it's unusual control scheme and movement. Most mazes begin with a barrage of cretins that must be dispatched in order to open the door to the main portion of the maze. Your character has a gun that is capable of turning the cretins into eggs. After shooting them, you must quickly shove the eggs into the sewer water as they will hatch back into cretins after a short time. Your gun has limited ammo but which can be replenished in the middle of the screen.

Once the cretins have been defeated, the doors to the main portion of the maze are accessible. Here is where you will find treasures to increase your point total. The mazes require careful navigation as some treasures are placed in dangerous locations. Keys need to be recovered to open further doors allowing you to proceed to the maze's exit. Other monsters are present in this part of the maze and cannot be destroyed by your weapon. Instead it will take careful timing and jumps to avoid being killed by them.

The game is divided into three levels which can be chosen at the start. Each level has multiple mazes to work your way through.

Joystick control is a little bit unusual. Aside from the normal left and right movement, pushing down shoots your weapon, pushing the button causes you to jump in the direction you are facing while pushing up does a vertical jump. When you move you will always move one complete step. This means you have to be careful when moving on small platforms as an extra tap on the joystick could send you off the edge. The structured movement gives the later parts of the maze a more puzzle-like feel than a straight action game.</desc>

		<name>Typhoon of Steel - Asia</name>
		<desc>Typhoon of Steel is a tactical level simulation of small unit actions during WWII. It is a sequel to the best selling Panzer Strike and the rules are very similar. Three theaters are covered: the Pacific Theater (Americans vs Japanese), the Asian Theater (British vs Japanese) and European Theater action involving American vs German troops. 

Typhoon of Steel includes practically every ground weapon used by the combatants in this theater (over 220 weapon types). Units consist of infantry squads or single guns and tanks. You can choose to simulate either single battles or entire campaigns spanning several years. In the single battles you can play against another person but in campaigns you play against the computer. 

The ultimate objective of the campaign games is to fight and win as many battles as possible before the war ends. If you suffer heavy losses during one battle it will take a long time to replace and upgrade your forces before you can fight the next battle. Single scenarios can last from 30 minutes to 2 hours with campaigns lasting up to 30 hours. Like Panzer Strike, the gameplay is considered to be advanced level.</desc>

		<desc>Typhoon of Steel is a tactical level simulation of small unit actions during WWII. It is a sequel to the best selling Panzer Strike and the rules are very similar. Three theaters are covered: the Pacific Theater (Americans vs Japanese), the Asian Theater (British vs Japanese) and European Theater action involving American vs German troops. 

Typhoon of Steel includes practically every ground weapon used by the combatants in this theater (over 220 weapon types). Units consist of infantry squads or single guns and tanks. You can choose to simulate either single battles or entire campaigns spanning several years. In the single battles you can play against another person but in campaigns you play against the computer. 

The ultimate objective of the campaign games is to fight and win as many battles as possible before the war ends. If you suffer heavy losses during one battle it will take a long time to replace and upgrade your forces before you can fight the next battle. Single scenarios can last from 30 minutes to 2 hours with campaigns lasting up to 30 hours. Like Panzer Strike, the gameplay is considered to be advanced level.</desc>

		<desc>Ultima revolves around a quest to find and destroy the Gem of Immortality, which is being used by the evil wizard Mondain to enslave the lands of Sosaria. The game was one of the first definitive commercial computer RPGs, and is considered an important and influential turning point for the development of the genre throughout years to come. In addition to its influences on the RPG genre, it is also the first open-world computer game.</desc>

		<name>Ultima III - Exodus</name>
		<desc>After the defeat of the evil wizard Mondain and his mistress Minax in the previous two Ultimas, peace has returned to the land of Sorsaria. Times passes and eventually geological disruptions and a resurgence of the monster populace occur, and it is soon learned that Mondain and Minax had conceived a child named Exodus before their death. Now that child has become an adult with the power to avenge the death of his parents. Obviously, it falls upon the hero from Earth to find and stop him. The third title in the Ultima series was the first to feature a party of adventurers instead of a single player character. The party is created at the beginning of the game by assigning various class combinations and determining the characters' attributes. The game has larger and more detailed towns, populated by NPCs the protagonist can converse with to obtain clues. Like in earlier Ultima games, exploration is divided between top-down overworld locations and first-person 3D dungeons. This installment introduces separate combat screens where player-controlled party fights multiple monsters in a turn-based tile-based system.</desc>

If you land on another car, you destroy it and collect points. You can also collect things like balloons and ice cream cones for bonus points. The faster you collect all the flags, the bigger a time bonus you get.

In later levels, there are dead-ends or gaps and a vehicle that is carrying a flag you need, so you will need to jump on it. If you are hit by another vehicle or go off the course, you lose a life. Two player games are alternating with the players taking their turns.</desc>

		<name>Vaults of Zurich</name>
		<desc>In The Vaults of Zurich the player takes control of a master thief who attempts a very daring heist. As the title implies it all takes place in the subterranean vault system of a Swiss bank and the goal of the game is to reach the chairman's chamber on the ninth level and steal the bank's most valuable possession: the OPEC oil deeds. The player has two hours of real time to accomplish this and return to the bank lobby. The game consists of nine levels that are connected with stairs. Each level is five sectors wide and five sectors long and each sector can be either a corridor or a vault room. As the player descends the value of the vaults increase but so does the strength of the guards that patrol the corridors.

The game is mostly played by entering keyboard commands (on some versions it's possible to move around with the joystick). Each vault room contains a certain amount of blue ship stock and a number of people. They can also contain tools and a television camera. To gain control of the wealth of a vault the player has to either fight, bribe or explode the people of the vault. Fighting is automatic once initiated and goes on until the player or the opposition has won. If the player wins he gets all the content of the vault. When bribing is successfully used the most valuable occupant of the vault joins the player and the player gets the vault contents in exchange for the bribe. If not successful combat will start with the player's change of winning being lower than normal.

In addition to fighting and bribing there are other actions requiring various tools that can be found around the vaults. These include plans that show the map of the level in full, keys that can open vault doors, drills that do the same but with a time penalty, wires that disable TV cameras and explosives that can kill people and destroy cameras. If a camera is not wired or destroyed an alarm might go off. When this happens the player has thirty seconds to leave the level or the game will be lost. Running into a guard when the alarm is on will also lead to game over. Alarms also lead to the player losing some wealth and the longer it takes to leave the more will be lost. 

In the corridors the player will come across guards. These can be fought but not bribed. Instead there are two other options, sneaking by or dumping. Dumping means the player drops one quarter of his wealth on the floor as a way to distract the guard and will then be able to pass. When sneaking there is a chance of triggering the alarm if spotted.</desc>

		<name>Wasteland</name>
		<desc>Wasteland takes place in the future after the nuclear holocaust of World War III. The player guides band of Desert Rangers from town to town, gradually uncovering a sinister plot that threatens what's left of mankind.

Much of the game is played like most other RPGs of its time: the player navigates the party through the top-down world, fights enemies (which appear randomly in hostile areas) in turn-based style on combat screens represented by enemy pictures, acquires information, equipment, and items from NPCs in towns, etc. The player can create a whole party of adventurers and/or recruit some of the characters that populate the game's world.

However, Wasteland also introduced an original skill system that has had a significant influence on the genre. The game makes use of the skill system in conjunction with traditional character attributes to achieve goals and get past obstacles. Beside helping the characters to fight more efficiently, main attributes sometimes have an impact on activities used outside of combat. For example, high strength can be applied to break a heavy object, charisma rating might influence the way NPCs interact with the main character, etc.

The skills work in a similar way: some of them improve the characters' proficiencies with different types of attacks and weapons, while others are needed to solve and/or by pass certain situations during interaction with the game's characters and objects. These skills are rather diverse, ranging from physical abilities such as swimming to more complex actions (medic, lock-picking), or even psychological states (confidence). Skill learning and progression depend on the main character's IQ rating.</desc>

		<name>Waterloo II</name>
		<desc>Based upon the battle of Waterloo, the player controls British and Prussian forces against Napoleon's French forces. Played from an overhead perspective on a large map of continental Western Europe, players forces are displayed as small tiles on the screen. In the Atari version, the player has a large smoothly scrolling map, while the Apple II version breaks the map into 16 individual segments, which can be viewed separately.
Character movement and commands are placed via text, and each player takes turns inputting 5 commands for their forces, followed by their opponent. Each set of commands causes 6 hours of gameplay to pass. Weather, terrain, and time of day effects troop movement. The player controls infantry, cavalry, artillery, supply trains, and other troop movements. Troops must regularly rest, and nighttime movement saps fighting men's strength. Each force is controlled by a general, and if they are lost, that teams troops leave the field.</desc>

		<name>Wishbringer</name>
		<desc>In this game, the player controls a postal clerk in the small fishing village of Festeron. The postmaster, Mr. Crisp, orders the player to deliver an envelope to the owner of Ye Olde Magick Shoppe. However, this seemingly innocent task inexplicably leads to a strange phenomenon: as the hero steps out, he finds that  Festeron has been mysteriously transformed into a dark, ominous town called Witchville. Even cute little poodles have turned into hellhounds! Finding the Wishbringer, a stone that grants seven wishes to those who possess the right objects, seems like the only solution - or is it?

Wishbringer is a text adventure set in the Zork universe. The player types in commands to navigate the character, interact with the game world, and solve puzzles. The game has a rather open-ended structure, with many situations possessing several solutions; the player can opt for a "magical" approach to the tasks, using the titular stone, or attempt to solve the game in a more straightforward way.</desc>

		<name>Wizard and the Princess</name>
		<desc>The Wizard and the Princess is an arcade adventure split into five stages where your quest is to rescue a Princess from an evil Wizard's castle. Starting with 120 Strength Points and 150 Magic Points you must get to the castle, slay a Dragon, search the castle before escaping with the Princess. You are armed with a sword and some spells where you can throw lightning bolts or fireballs, or put monsters to sleep and slit their throats. When not fighting you can increase your strength or pray for guidance. Each stage have different game styles and they are:

Stage One: On a single screen viewed from above you start on the left of the screen with the castle on the right. You must move across the screen through the hills and flat ground while moving round the trees and mountains. On your journey you will encounter monsters to fight as well as pools to drink from but these can either weaken or strengthen you.

Stage Two:  A single screen viewed from the side sees your warrior having to slay a fire breathing Dragon. The Dragon moves around the screen and will stop occasionally to breath out fire and you must avoid the fire and the Dragon to kill it in a sweet spot with your sword.

Stage Three: With the Dragon slayed you must move around a 1st person perspective maze looking for the exit.

Stage Four: Another maze but this time viewed from above as you search various rooms looking for the Princess. You must kill every monster you encounter before the Princess is released. Lightning bolts can be used to remove walls.

Stage Five: You have finally found and rescued the Princess but outside the castle you have more dangers to face before the Princess is safe. Viewed from the side on a single screen, you must cross a bridge while avoiding falling rocks. Once you have crossed the bridge you will face a two-headed monster that needs killing before your quest is over.</desc>

		<name>Xevious</name>
		<desc>A hundred thousand years ago, an ancient civilization prospered on our Earth, their product being GAMP (General Artificial Matrix Producer). In order to survive the Ice Age, most of the Earth's inhabitants have decided to leave it, finally settling on a planet called Xevious. A group of humans remained, becoming our own ancestors. Many years have passed, and the Xevians are now planning a massive comeback to their long-lost homeland. The pilot Mu, his android companion Eve, and Mio, a Xevian who opposes the GAMP regime, are back from a space travel just in time to warn the Earth of the upcoming invasion. The prototype fighter craft Solvalou is going to be used as the main weapon against the Xevian attack.

Xevious is a vertically-scrolling shooter which is notable for being the first game of that type to feature an aircraft flying over the Earth (as opposed to the outer space in other games), displaying views of South American nature. It also introduced, for the first time, two types of enemies to fight: aerial and ground-based (the menacing SOL towers invoked by GAMP to aid their planes). The player-controlled ship, Solvalou, is equipped with two weapons, each assigned to a button: the Zapper for air enemies, and the Blaster, which drops bombs on ground targets with the aid of a lock-on. The aerial enemies are divided into sub-categories distinguished by their attack and behavior patterns. Certain enemy types are immune to Solvalou's weapons, and must be avoided.</desc>

		<desc>Hasbro's Yahtzee gives players a set of five dice, with the aim of obtaining a scoring combination from three rolls (keeping any dice they like after each of the first two). There are 13 of these scoring combinations - The Upper Section allows you to only count dice of a particular digit (with a 35-point bonus if you total more than 63 (effectively, three of each)), while the Lower Section rewards specific tricks, such as small and large straights (runs of four and five consecutive numbers respectively) and the Yahtzee - five of a kind. You have 13 turns each, and if you can't score in a box, you must zero one. The strategy is therefore to maximise each box to obtain the best overall score.

You can play the game this way, but two new modes are added to the computerised implementation. Triple Yahtzee maximises this strategic element - you play 39 turns each on a scorecard with 3 columns worth single, double and treble points. Strategy is therefore more advanced - Is a 3-of-a-kind score of 23 worth trebling, or could you get better in a future roll? Should a roll of four sixes go on your triple-score Upper Section, or on the double-score one which is marginal on reaching the bonus? Should you give up on the single-score Upper Section, and use it as a 'dump' for bad combinations?

The Power Yahtzee mode is the meat of the game. On a standard gamesheet, you play as standard, but using advanced power-ups. These can guide you to favourable moves, inflict bad luck on opponents, block out certain squares on your opponent's board, and so on. Winning games of this unlocks further powerups.</desc>

		<desc>The Zaxxon defence system must be destroyed in this isometric-viewed shoot 'em up. The game has three stages, first taking you through Asteroid City, which is heavily protected by aircraft, guns and missiles. Many barriers are alarmed, leaving you with limited space to progress through, and fire must constantly be dodged.

Stage two is a space shoot out against hordes of enemy aircraft - those you failed to destroy in the first part of the task. Complete this and you reach the final battle with Zaxxon, the game looping with increased difficulty if you can survive the first time. There are three distinct skill levels, while controls involve using forward to dive and back to climb, in the manner of flight simulation.</desc>

		<desc>Ringside Seat is a realistic simulation of professional boxing, allowing the player to manage the greatest fighters of all time - the game includes data for over 45 great fighters past and present. It can be played as a two-player, one player against the computer, or a no-player (computer managed fight) game.

Select a fighter, choose one of eight weight classes or divisions, the number of rounds (3-15) and, should your fighter have the ability to fight as either a boxer or slugger, his fighting style. You will then decide whether you prefer to have the cumulative judges' scores displayed while the fight is in progress or at the end of the fight.

Both managers select their fighter's strategy each round. Strategy options are Fight Flat Footed, Cover Up, Charge In, Stick &amp; Move, Stay Away, Go For The Knockout and Protect Cuts. Once both managers have selected their strategy, the round bell will ring and the two fighters will approach the center ring. Using text and semi-animated screen display, you will see the fight in the ring as it happens, blow-by-blow, round-by-round.
Each fighter is rated in over 25 categories such as strength, stamina and style. You have the ability to save our fighter and are also given the ability to save a fight in progress to resume at a later date.</desc>

		<desc>Space Shuttle is a simulation game where you are the pilot of the space shuttle Discovery. Your goal is to launch the Discovery, establish an orbit around the Earth, open the cargo bay doors and recover a satellite to perform repairs, and finally land the Discovery successfully, all while using as little fuel as possible. Each time the complete mission is accomplished, it will then repeat at a higher difficulty level (in the higher difficulty levels the satellite has a more erratic flight path). The game is played from a first-person perspective in the space shuttle cockpit where you can control everything from the shuttle's engines to cargo bay doors. When the game is over you will be given a ranking which is based on the number of successful dockings and the amount of fuel that was used. In addition to the full flight mode, two easier game variations (auto simulator and simulator mode) are included. The auto simulator mode is the easiest; the computer will control the flight (you can take over at any point you wish) and the controls are simplified. The simulation mode is closer to the full game, however, you have an unlimited amount of fuel so there is no time pressure, and the computer will help compensate for inaccurate maneuvering.</desc>

		<name>Gemstone Warrior</name>
		<desc>Gemstone Warrior is an action game with adventure elements.  Players work their way through an underground catacomb, doing three things at once.  First they need to find five pieces of a gemstone, spread throughout the maze.  Second they need to avoid getting killed by the guardians of the catacomb.  Finally they need to map the game, because the place is so large that it is easy to get lost.  Once the Gemstone Warrior has collected the five gemstone pieces, he needs to move back to the point where he began the game.

The hero has to go underground because of demons.  They stole the gemstone from humans, because they were jealous of the good magic it brought to humankind.  They broke it up and spread it throughout their dungeon, to hide it.

This game is not just a "shoot-em-up"; it has many of the features of that style of game, but also gives players time to think.  It includes a pause which helps one map and also to freeze a room, to see what is running toward the Gemstone Warrior. The game also has a save feature, which is useful just before entering a new room: if the Gemstone Warrior is ambushed, players can give him another chance.

After killing opponents, the Gemstone Warrior has the opportunity to search the bodies for treasure.  Monsters carry arrows, and also "magic bolts."  The latter are interesting, as they destroy treasure too, as well as the Gemstone Warrior, should he be too close to the explosion.  Magic items abound, and help the warrior make it through the caverns.  Some magic items are traps too; there is a healing potion bottle that is similar to a poison bottle.  Other magic items include effects to freeze opponents, turn the warrior invisible, hide him among monsters with an illusion, annihilate all opponents in the current cavern, and cure disease.</desc>

		<name>Tron</name>
		<desc>Based on the 1982 Midway arcade game based off the Disney film, players take control of TRON in four different game grid scenarios:
Light Cycles: race TRON's blue Light Cycle against one or more enemy Cycles in an attempt to have them crash and de-rez against their own light walls.

I/O Tower: blast through numerous Grid Bugs in an attempt to get into the I/O Tower.

MCP Cone: blast through the defensive walls of the MCP in order to get into its central cone.

Battle Tanks: maneuver TRON's tank against one or more enemy tanks (or Recognizers) to be the last one standing.
The Xbox Live version offers competitive or co-op play to go for the highest score, and a mode that features enhanced graphics.</desc>

		<name>Death Sword</name>
		<desc>The evil magician Drax is terrorizing the jeweled city and cast a spell over the beautiful princess Marina who is forced to obey him. From the lands to the north, a hero is sent to help the city and free the princess. He is Gorth, the strongest of the barbarian warriors. With his sword in hand, he has to beat eight of Drax's best warriors and at last the magician himself. He will fight them in the woods, on the mountaintop, in the dungeon... finally reaching Drax's palace itself.

This is essentially a one- or two-player fighting game where you control a big barbarian and fight another player or a computer AI.  There are several kinds of hits, and some hits take off half a point while others take off a whole point. Each player has six of these "power points". They also have a special hard to perform "death sword" which decapitates your opponent, killing him with one fell swoop.</desc>

		<name>The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai</name>
		<desc>A tie-in to the 1984 film The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension, you play the ineffably cool Dr. Banzai: radical neurosurgeon, cutting-edge physicist, nemesis of nefarious criminal mastermind Hanoi Xan and lead guitarist of new-wave sensation the Hong Kong Cavaliers. (Unfortunately, you'll have to take our word for it, as the game doesn't make much use of these qualities).

As in the wacky movie, your goal here is ultimately to overcome a potentially planet-destroying bomb set by the Black Lectroids, inhabitants of Planet 10. Unlike the movie, you don't accomplish this by overcoming the Red Lectroids from the 8th Dimension with the assistance of Team Banzai and the Blue Blaze Irregulars -- instead you wander an eerily depopulated town to procure the necessary components (gasoline, sand, bauxite and "a special catalyst") to power up your oscillation overthruster-sporting jet-car and transmit cancellation codes to the bomb. The game uses a simple VERB NOUN text parser and, on some platforms, illustrates the scene with static images.</desc>

		<name>Bruce Lee</name>
		<desc>The late martial arts hero features in this platform game, with the aim of reaching a wizard in an underground lair, defeat of whom can offer him untold wealth. 

In each area you must collect the many strategically-placed lanterns before exiting through the newly-revealed passageway. Some rooms also have escalator-type sections to run along, and the standard (although slightly illogical in this context) ladders.  There are 20 areas to be completed.

On the way, you'll fight two enemies - a ninja and a green sumo warrior named Yamo. You can defeat them by punching, kicking, dropping on their heads or luring them into hazardous terrain, or even by making them accidentally hit each other. Even after they are killed, however, they keep coming back for more after a few seconds. Since they can move pretty intelligently (they even climb ladders), you should watch out for them. The game also allows a second player to take control of Yamo.

There are lots of hazards to avoid by either walking round or jumping - walls of electrical charge and exploding bushes for example.</desc>

Karateka is viewed from the side and features a succession of increasingly difficult opponents. Three types of punches and kicks are available to both the player character and his foes, differentiated by their height (low, medium, and high). The protagonist has a health bar, which refills itself gradually when he stands still.</desc>
